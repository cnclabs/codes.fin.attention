item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook executive overview and outlook we began fiscal determined to improve our operational performance to drive our return to profitability  despite several prior years of disappointing macro economic and housing statistics 
there are four components of our multi year path to profitability strategy drive sales per community per month  gradually expand our community count  generate higher gross margins and leverage or reduce our fixed costs  including both overheads and interest expense 
improving our sales per community per month while holding down fixed costs were our top priorities for fiscal our results for the year illustrate the significant progress we made in these areas as well as early signs of some margin improvement 
specifically  we recognized our fifth consecutive quarter with year over year increases in new home orders  home closings and backlog  our trailing four quarter sales per community per month increased from approximately at september  to at september  our general administrative expenses declined from of homebuilding revenue in fiscal to in fiscal  and finally  homebuilding gross margins excluding interest  impairments  and abandonments increased basis points year over year from in fiscal to 

table of contents during fiscal  we successfully completed a series of capital markets transactions that significantly strengthened our balance sheet  reduced annual interest expense and increased liquidity 
specifically  in july  we raised over million in growth capital through the issuance of equity and equity linked securities 
we expect the majority of the net proceeds from these offerings to be used for the acquisition of incremental land parcels in those markets in which we operate with the highest expected growth rate in building permits and employment over the next five years  including our markets in florida  texas  california  arizona and north carolina 
also in july  we refinanced our senior secured notes due with new senior secured notes due this transaction along with other smaller financing transactions completed during fiscal will save us approximately million in annual interest expense 
finally  in september we completed our million revolving credit facility to provide additional liquidity for our future business needs 
while putting intense focus on improving the operations of our existing communities  we employed a cautious approach to land acquisition throughout most of fiscal but given our success at improving our sales per community per month metrics  improving margins and the capital infusion last summer  during our fiscal fourth quarter  we began to more aggressively pursue land acquisitions in an effort to increase our number of active communities 
in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we activated a large mid atlantic project that had previously been held for future development 
this project and most of the newly acquired land parcels will require some level of development and therefore will not be available for homebuilding operations until late fiscal or early fiscal as a result  we expect to continue to experience a decline in community count until these new communities are fully developed and open for business 
we anticipate that today s complex  inconsistent and sometimes difficult mortgage origination environment will continue to constrain mortgage availability 
to address the homebuyers perceived challenge of securing a mortgage  during fiscal  we implemented new practices to facilitate the process by making available a small number of preferred lenders who compete to offer our buyers a comprehensive set of mortgage products  competitive rates and outstanding customer service 
the overall housing market appears to have stabilized and even begun to improve in many markets and we believe we will continue to benefit from projected population growth and increases in housing starts in the coming years 
in the meantime  we are taking the steps necessary to drive improvement in our homebuilding operations  while maintaining an efficient cost structure  looking for new opportunities to generate profits and investing for future growth  all with the intention to accelerate our return to profitability 
in fiscal  we will continue to focus on the implementation of our operational strategies drive sales per community per month  gradually expand our community count  generate higher gross margins and further leverage our fixed costs 
critical accounting policies some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
inventory valuation held for development our homebuilding inventories that are accounted for as held for development include land and home construction assets grouped together as communities 
homebuilding inventories held for development are stated at cost including direct construction costs  capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets no less than quarterly for recoverability 
generally  upon the commencement of land development activities  it may take three to five years depending on  among other things  the size of the community and its sales pace to fully develop  sell  construct and close all the homes in a typical community 
however  the impact of the recent downturn in our business has significantly lengthened the estimated life of many communities 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated are expected to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
when conducting our community level review for the recoverability of our homebuilding inventories held for development  we establish a quarterly watch list of communities with more than homes remaining that carry profit margins in backlog and in our forecast that are below a minimum threshold of profitability 
in our experience  this threshold represents a level of profitability that may be an indicator of conditions which would require an asset impairment but does not guarantee that such impairment will definitively be appropriate 
as such  assets on the quarterly watch list are subject to substantial additional financial and operational analyses and review that consider the competitive environment and other factors contributing to profit margins below our watch list threshold 
for communities where the current competitive and market dynamics indicate that these factors may be other than temporary  which may call into question the recoverability of our investment  a formal impairment analysis is performed 
the formal impairment analysis consists of both qualitative competitive market analyses and a quantitative analysis reflecting market and asset specific information 

table of contents our qualitative competitive market analyses include site visits to competitor new home communities and written community level competitive assessments 
a competitive assessment consists of a comparison of our specific community with its competitor communities  considering square footage of homes offered  amenities offered within the homes and the communities  location  transportation availability and school districts  among many factors 
in addition  we review the pace of monthly home sales of our competitor communities in relation to our specific community 
we also review other factors such as the target buyer and the macro economic characteristics that impact the performance of our assets  such as unemployment and the availability of mortgage financing  among other things 
based on this qualitative competitive market analysis  adjustments to our sales prices may be required in order to make our communities competitive 
we incorporate these adjusted prices in our quantitative analysis for the specific community 
the quantitative analysis compares the projected future undiscounted cash flows for each such community with its current carrying value 
this undiscounted cash flow analysis requires important assumptions regarding the location and mix of house plans to be sold  current and future home sale prices and incentives for each plan  current and future construction costs for each plan  and the pace of monthly sales to occur today and into the future 
there is uncertainty associated with preparing the undiscounted cash flow analysis because future market conditions will almost certainly be different  either better or worse  than current conditions 
the single most important input to the cash flow analysis is current and future home sales prices for a specific community 
the risk of over or under stating any of the important cash flow variables  including home prices  is greater with longer lived communities and within markets that have historically experienced greater home price volatility 
in an effort to address these risks  we consider some home price and construction cost appreciation in future years for certain communities that are expected to be selling for more than three years and or if the market has typically exhibited high levels of price volatility 
absent these assumptions on cost and sales price appreciations  we believe the long term cash flow analysis would be unrealistic and would serve to artificially improve future profitability 
finally  we also ensure that the monthly sales absorptions  including historical seasonal differences of our communities and those of our competitors  used in our undiscounted cash flow analyses are realistic  consider our development schedules and relate to those achieved by our competitors for the specific communities 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows from our quantitative analysis are in excess of the carrying value  the asset is considered to be recoverable and is not impaired 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying or book value  we perform a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the community 
the fair value of the community is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying community assets 
the discount rate used may be different for each community 
the factors considered when determining an appropriate discount rate for a community include  among others community specific factors such as the number of lots in the community  the status of land development in the community  the competitive factors influencing the sales performance of the community and overall market factors such as employment levels  consumer confidence and the existing supply of new and used homes for sale 
if the determined fair value is less than the carrying value of the specific asset  the asset is considered not recoverable and is written down to its fair value plus the asset s share of capitalized unallocated interest and other costs 
the carrying value of assets in communities that were previously impaired and continue to be classified as held for development is not increased for future estimates of increases in fair value in future reporting periods 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to projected home sales prices and absorption rates  the timing and amount of the estimated future cash flows and discount rates  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment analyses 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and absorption rates require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
because the projected cash flows used to evaluate the fair value of inventory are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions including decreased sales prices  a change in sales prices or changes in absorption estimates based on current market conditions and management s assumptions relative to future results could lead to additional impairments in certain communities during any given period 
market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges on previously impaired homebuilding assets in addition to homebuilding assets not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market conditions deteriorate 
asset valuation land held for future development for those communities for which construction and development activities are expected to occur in the future or have been idled land held for future development  all applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred and the inventory is stated at cost unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the future enactment of a development plan or the occurrence of events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the potential development plans of each community in land held for future development if changes in facts and circumstances occur which would give rise to a more detailed analysis for a change in the status of a community to active status or held for development 

table of contents asset valuation land held for sale we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
the following criteria are used to determine if land is held for sale management has the authority and commits to a plan to sell the land  the land is available for immediate sale in its present condition  there is an active program to locate a buyer and the plan to sell the property has been initiated  the sale of the land is probable within one year  the property is being actively marketed at a reasonable sale price relative to its current fair value  and it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn or that significant changes to the plan will be made 
additionally  in certain circumstances  management will re evaluate the best use of an asset that is currently being accounted for as held for development 
in such instances  management will review  among other things  the current and projected competitive circumstances of the community  including the level of supply of new and used inventory  the level of sales absorptions by us and our competition  the level of sales incentives required and the number of owned lots remaining in the community 
if  based on this review and the foregoing criteria have been met at the end of the applicable reporting period  we believe that the best use of the asset is the sale of all or a portion of the asset in its current condition  then all or portions of the community are accounted for as held for sale 
in determining the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  we consider factors including current sales prices for comparable assets in the area  recent market analysis studies  appraisals  any recent legitimate offers  and listing prices of similar properties 
if the estimated fair value less cost to sell of an asset is less than its current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about land sales prices require significant judgment because the current market is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of land held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results and may result in additional impairments if market conditions deteriorate 
homebuilding revenues and costs revenue from the sale of a home is generally recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk of ownership is transferred to the buyer 
as appropriate  revenue for condominiums under construction is recognized based on the percentage of completion method  when certain criteria are met 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are recognized as expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves we currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined performance quality standards 
in addition  we provide a limited warranty generally ranging from a minimum of five years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose covering only certain defined construction defects 
we also provide a defined structural warranty with single family homes and townhomes in certain states 
since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors whose contracts generally include an indemnity obligation and a requirement that certain minimum insurance requirements be met  including providing us with a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work  claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of our subcontractors 
warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty expense for each home closed 
management reviews the adequacy of warranty reserves each reporting period  based on historical experience and management s estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjusts these provisions accordingly 

table of contents our review includes a quarterly analysis of the historical data and trends in warranty expense by operating segment 
an analysis by operating segment allows us to consider market specific factors such as our warranty experience  the number of home closings  the prices of homes  product mix and other data in estimating our warranty reserves 
in addition  our analysis also contemplates the existence of any non recurring or community specific warranty related matters that might not be contemplated in our historical data and trends 
as a result of our analyses  we adjust our estimated warranty liabilities 
based on historical results  we believe that our existing estimation process is accurate and do not anticipate the process to materially change in the future 
our estimation process for such accruals is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that our current warranty reserves are adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated entities excluding our investment in a pre owned rental homes reit  the remainder of our investments in unconsolidated entities are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in our unconsolidated entities under the equity method 
we recognize our share of profits and losses from the sale of lots to other buyers 
our share of profits from lots purchased by beazer homes from the unconsolidated entities are deferred and treated as a reduction of the cost of the land purchased from the joint venture 
such profits are subsequently recognized at the time the home closes and title passes to the homebuyer 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary 
the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
our assumption of the joint venture s estimated fair value is dependent on market conditions 
inventory in the joint venture is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities 
if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity  our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
the operating results of the unconsolidated joint ventures are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry  which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates  credit availability  unemployment levels and consumer sentiment 
changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities 
because of these changes in economic conditions  actual results could differ materially from management s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if an assessment of their components indicates that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of these assets will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  the section limitation on our ability to carryforward pre ownership change net operating losses and recognized built in losses or deductions  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for the valuation of deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during fiscal  we determined that it was not more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized and  therefore  we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
we have not changed our assessment regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets as of september  and consequently  we determined that a valuation allowance was still warranted 
management reassesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets each reporting period 
to the extent that our results of operations improve and deferred tax assets become realizable  the valuation allowance will 
table of contents be reduced and result in a non cash tax benefit 
we experienced an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code as of january  section contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforward and certain built in losses or deductions recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
therefore  our ability to utilize our pre ownership change net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain recognized built in losses or deductions is limited by section there can be no assurance that another ownership change  as defined in the tax law  will not occur 
if another ownership change occurs  a new annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would be determined as of that date 
seasonal and quarterly variability our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  challenging conditions experienced since fiscal have reduced typical seasonal variations 
in addition  the expiration of the  first time homebuyer tax credit on june   appears to have incentivized certain homebuyers to purchase homes during the first half of fiscal and close those homes prior to june  over the past two years  we have begun to see a more normalized seasonal pattern of new orders and closings as reflected in the following chart which presents certain quarterly operating data for our continuing operations for our last twelve fiscal quarters

inventory impairments and abandonments 
gross margins for the fiscal years ended september   and were positively impacted by a decrease in non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  for certain communities we determined that it was prudent to reduce sales prices or further increase sales incentives in response to factors including the competitive market conditions in those specific submarkets for the product and locations of these communities 
because the projected cash flows used to evaluate the fair value of inventory are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions including decreased sales prices  the change in sales prices and changes in absorption estimates based on current market conditions and management s assumptions relative to future results led to additional impairments during this period 
in future periods  we may determine that it is prudent to reduce sales prices  increase sales incentives or reduce absorption rates in specific communities which may lead to additional impairments  which could be material 
the impairments on land held for sale for the fiscal years ended september   and represent further write downs of certain properties to net realizable value  less estimated costs to sell and are a result of our review of recent comparable transactions 
in addition  over the past few years  we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as pre acquisition costs 
we recorded minimal abandonment charges during the fiscal years ended september   and related to these decisions 

table of contents the following tables set forth  by reportable homebuilding segment  the inventory impairments and lot option abandonment charges recorded for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands fiscal year ended september  west east southeast unallocated continuing operations the estimated fair value of our impaired inventory at each period end  the number of lots and number of communities impaired in each period are set forth in the table below as follows in thousands

commissions as a percentage of homebuilding revenues were decreased slightly in the current fiscal year 
general and administrative expense items 
the decrease in g a expense for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior years is primarily related to the impact of prior cost reductions realized related to headcount and office space reductions and management changes 
unconsolidated entity impairment charges 
as a result of the economic conditions in certain of our markets  we recorded impairments in certain of our unconsolidated entities totaling million  and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements where further discussed 
the fiscal impairments above do not include approximately million of charges related to joint venture guarantees recognized in g a expense 
if these adverse market conditions worsen  we may have to take further impairments of our investments in these unconsolidated entities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there were no such impairment charges in fiscal loss gain on extinguishment of debt 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt primarily related to the repurchase of million of our senior secured notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date  and  to a lesser extent  to our exchange of a significant portion of our mandatory convertible subordinated notes and tangible equity units 
during the fiscal year ended september   we redeemed or repurchased in open market transactions an aggregate of million of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
these transactions resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs related to these notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during fiscal  we completed a number of financial transactions including the repurchase of an aggregate of million of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
we also completed an exchange of million of our outstanding junior unsecured notes 
these transactions resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs related to these notes

income taxes 
our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by various factors  the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
due to the effect of our valuation allowance adjustments beginning in fiscal  a comparison of our annual effective tax rates must consider the changes in our valuation allowance 
our overall effective tax rates from continuing operations were  and for the fiscal years ended september   and the change in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september   was primarily attributable to tax planning which created certainty in the recognition of some of our prior year s unrecognized tax benefits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the impact of our valuation allowance and limited ability to carry back any federal income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the five year carryback of federal tax losses due to the expanded nol carryback provisions contained in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  enacted on november  these expanded nol carryback provisions allowed us to carry back our fiscal tax losses to prior years 
absent the new legislation  the fiscal federal tax loss would have been carried forward to be available to offset future taxable income and the company would have maintained a valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset

as of september  v v backlog units west east southeast total aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog in millions fiscal versus during fiscal  all of our segments experienced improvements in net new orders as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in net new orders has been driven by the considerable strides we made to improve our internal operations as well as improvement in the overall housing industry 
our year over year increase in net new orders reflects efficiency gains in many of our communities 
specifically  we increased our sales per community per month and reduced the percentage of underperforming communities as compared to the prior year 
we accomplished this growth as a result of our focus on improving our internal operations  however  during this time we delayed expanding our community count and  as communities have closed out  we experienced an decrease in average active communities from the fourth quarter of fiscal to this decrease in active communities will hinder our new order growth in the future until new communities are developed and active for sale 
our west and southeast segments also benefited from improving market conditions as evidenced by increased traffic to our communities 
the increases in new orders in these segments were moderated slightly by a lower increase in new orders  net of cancellations in our east segment 
despite the increased traffic in many of our markets  potential buyers still continue to be negatively impacted by the lengthened mortgage process and limited financing availability 
these challenges not only impact our ability to sell homes  but also impact our potential homebuyer s ability to sell existing homes and to obtain mortgage financing 
the increase in backlog for our continuing operations at september  compared to the prior year related to our growth in net new orders and the impact of our higher beginning backlog 
our reduced active community count will hinder our growth until new communities come on line  however  once that occurs  we expect new orders and backlog to increase as the availability of mortgage loans stabilizes  the inventory of new and used homes decreases and consumer confidence in the economic recovery increases 
fiscal versus new orders  net of cancellations  for fiscal decreased slightly compared to fiscal in many of our markets driven by decreased demand in the first half of the year  homebuyer financing challenges and increased cancellation rates 
federal and state housing tax credits appear to have incentivized more prospective buyers to purchase a new home in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  our cancellation rates in fiscal were impacted by the challenges some of our potential homebuyers encountered selling existing homes and obtaining financing 
the decrease in net new orders in our west segment was primarily due to continued challenging market conditions which were particularly pronounced in our houston and california markets 
in fiscal  our houston and southern california markets in our west segment and virginia in our east segment were also impacted by the closeout of communities that were performing at higher than average absorption rates in the prior year and by the timing of new communities opening for sales 
the increase in total units in backlog and the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog for our continuing operations at september  compared to the prior year  related partially to the increased sales in our fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal and the impact of several new mortgage underwriting audit processes implemented in september by one mortgage provider which pushed over home closings from the last week of september into october the first quarter of fiscal

the increase in closings was also impacted by a higher beginning backlog related to increased sales in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year and improved traffic in many of our markets which enhanced our ability to generate additional sales and closings in the current fiscal year 
the increase in asp was primarily attributable to the mix in closings between products and among communities as compared to the prior year  although certain markets were able to selectively increase asp in response to improving market conditions 
fiscal versus homebuilding revenues decreased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the comparable period of the prior year which benefited from federal and state housing tax credits that expired in june the housing tax credits appear to have incentivized homebuyers to purchase homes in fiscal absent these tax credits  potential homebuyers appeared to lack a sense of urgency to commit to a home purchase  especially in the first half of fiscal however  we experienced double digit improvements in new orders in all three segments in both our third and fourth quarters of fiscal this new order growth generated increased closings and revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the prior year and significantly increased our backlog as of september  the change in asp was primarily attributable to the change in mix of closings between products and among communities as compared to the prior year 
the fiscal asp was also impacted by our efforts to market our homes competitively with local competition and to reduce spec inventory with discounted sales prices and incentives in certain markets in the first half of the year 
homebuilding gross profit 
homebuilding gross profit is defined as homebuilding revenues less home cost of sales which includes land and land development costs  home construction costs  capitalized interest  indirect costs of construction  estimated warranty costs  closing costs and inventory impairment and lot option abandonment charges 
corporate and unallocated costs include the amortization of capitalized interest and indirect construction costs 
the following table sets forth our homebuilding gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment and total homebuilding gross profit and gross margin  and such amounts excluding inventory impairments and abandonments and interest amortized to cost of sales for the fiscal years ended september   and total homebuilding gross profit and gross margin excluding inventory impairments and abandonments and interest amortized to cost of sales are not gaap financial measures 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to homebuilding gross profit determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance 
the magnitude and volatility of non cash inventory impairment and abandonment charges for the company  and for other home builders  have been significant in recent periods and  as such  have made financial analysis of our industry more difficult 
homebuilding metrics excluding these charges  and other similar presentations by analysts and other companies  is frequently used to assist investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of home building activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies respective level of impairments and levels of debt 
management believes these non gaap measures aid investors understanding of our operating performance by providing transparency for items such as inventory impairment and abandonment charges and interest amortized to home construction and land sales expenses

as compared to the prior year  our homebuilding gross margins excluding impairments for the fiscal year ended september  increased in the west and southeast segments primarily due to decreased incentives  price appreciation in certain submarkets and increased absorptions which enabling us to better leverage certain fixed costs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our homebuilding gross margins excluding impairments in the east segment 
the decreased margin in the east segment is related to changes in product and community mix and  to a lesser extent  to pricing feature changes made in certain of our markets to drive absorptions  respond to competitor actions and address consumer demand 
during the fiscal year ended september   our corporate and unallocated gross profit without i a and interest reflects a benefit from an million insurance recovery related to previously recorded water intrusion warranty related expenditures 
our east segment benefited from a million warranty recovery during the fiscal year ended september  these warranty recoveries year to date in fiscal and contributed bps and bps to our homebuilding gross margins without i a and interest  respectively 
fiscal versus for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior year  the decrease in gross margins across all segments is primarily due to decreased revenues and the impact of those revenues on indirect construction costs which are relatively fixed in the short term 
the impact of our decreased revenues was partially offset by cost reductions and lower inventory impairments and lot option abandonment charges in the current fiscal year 
in fiscal  certain of our markets realized a nominal increase in gross margins excluding impairments as prices began to stabilize in certain of our markets and we benefited from cost reductions 
however  our nevada and southern california markets in our west segment were impacted by the closeout of communities that were performing 
table of contents at higher than average gross margins as compared to the margins realized by the current product mix in those markets  including new communities opening for sales in fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   our corporate and unallocated gross profit without i a and interest reflects a benefit from warranty recoveries of million 
these warranty recoveries year to date in fiscal contributed bps to our homebuilding gross margins without i a and interest 
impairment turn impact in a given quarter or fiscal year  our reported gross margins arise from both communities previously impaired and communities not previously impaired 
in addition as indicated above  certain gross margin amounts arise from recoveries of prior period costs  including warranty items that are not directly tied to communities generating revenue in the period 
home closings from communities previously impaired would  in most instances  generate very low or negative gross margins prior to the impact of the previously recognized impairment 
gross margins at each home closing are higher for a particular community after an impairment because the carrying value of the underlying land was previously reduced to the present value of future cash flows as a result of the impairment  leading to lower cost of sales at the home closing 
this improvement in gross margin resulting from one or more prior impairments is frequently referred to in the aggregate as the impairment turn or flow back of impairments within the reporting period 
the amount of this impairment turn may exceed the gross margin for an individual impaired asset if the gross margin for that asset prior to the impairment would have been negative 
the extent to which this impairment turn is greater than the reported gross margin for the individual asset is related to the specific historical cost basis of that individual asset 
the asset valuations which result from our impairment calculations are based on discounted cash flow analyses and are not derived by simply applying prospective gross margins to individual communities 
as such  impaired communities may have gross margins that are somewhat higher or lower than the gross margin for unimpaired communities 
the mix of home closings in any particular quarter varies to such an extent that comparisons between previously impaired and never impaired communities would not be a reliable way to ascertain profitability trends or to assess the accuracy of previous valuation estimates 
in addition  since any amount of impairment turn is tied to individual lots in specific communities it will vary considerably from period to period 
as a result of these factors  we review the impairment turn impact on gross margins on a trailing twelve month basis rather than a quarterly basis as a way of considering whether our impairment calculations are resulting in gross margins for impaired communities that are comparable to our unimpaired communities 
for fiscal  the homebuilding gross margin from our continuing operations was and excluding interest and inventory impairments  it was 
excluding the aforementioned warranty recovery  our fiscal homebuilding gross margin without i a and interest would have been 
for the same period  homebuilding gross margins were as follows in those communities that have previously been impaired homebuilding gross margin from previously impaired communities pre impairment turn gross margin impact of interest amortized to cos related to these communities pre impairment turn gross margin  excluding interest amortization impact of impairment turns gross margin post impairment turns  excluding interest these previously impaired communities represented of our closings in fiscal their lower post impairment turn average gross margin negatively impacted our overall homebuilding gross margins during fiscal as these communities continue to close out  we expect the impact on our overall homebuilding gross margin to be reduced 
land sales and other revenues 
land sales relate to land and lots sold that did not fit within our homebuilding programs and strategic plans in these markets 
other revenues include net fees we received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party and broker fees and rental revenues earned by our pre owned operations through may  the table below summarizes land sales and other revenues and gross profit by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands n m in the table below indicates the percentage is not meaningful 
table of contents land sales other revenues v v west east southeast pre owned n m total land sales and other gross profit loss v v west east southeast pre owned n m total fiscal versus the decrease in land sales and other revenue and gross profit in fiscal from fiscal related primarily to the decrease in our land held for sale 
during fiscal  we successfully sold a number of land positions that did not meet our strategic objectives 
our land sales and other gross profit in our southeast segment includes fees received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party 
we contributed our pre owned homes business for an investment in an unconsolidated entity on may  fiscal versus the increase in land sales and other revenue and gross profit in fiscal from fiscal related primarily to our ability to dispose of land and lots that did not fit into our strategic plans 
our fiscal loss on land sales in our southeast segment was offset partially by net fees received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party 
as of september   our previous pre owned operations had purchased homes  of which were leased 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we enter into derivative agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with fluctuating interest rates 
as of september   we were not a party to any such derivative agreements 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
liquidity and capital resources 
our sources of liquidity include  but are not limited to  cash from operations  proceeds from senior notes and other bank borrowings  the issuance of equity and equity linked securities and other external sources of funds 
our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon our level of net income  working capital management cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other liabilities and available credit facilities 
as of september   our liquidity position consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents plus million of restricted cash  of which million related to our cash secured term loan  million of which was repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect to maintain a significant liquidity position during fiscal  subject to changes in market conditions that would alter our expectations for land and land development expenditures or capital market transactions which could increase or decrease our cash balance on a quarterly basis 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  our net cash used in operating activities was million and million  respectively compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal our net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the payment of trade accounts payable  interest obligations and other liabilities 
our net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was impacted by an increase in inventory excluding inventory impairments and abandonment charges and decreases in consolidated inventory not owned of million 
the increase in inventory in fiscal related primarily to our strategic investments in land as we closed out older communities and positioned the company to open new communities 
during fiscal  we intentionally delayed inventory reinvestments as we focused on improving our operations and existing community performance 
our net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was due to the receipts of federal income tax refunds  net of income tax payments  totaling million  which offset cash used to purchase inventory and maintain our operations 
our cash used in provided by operations is also impacted by changes in trade accounts payables related to the timing of development expenditures as of period end related to homes sold and spec homes completed 
table of contents during the quarter prior to period end 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  which was due primarily to release of million of restricted cash collateral related to our cash secured term loan offset partially by capital expenditures primarily used for new model homes 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  which was primarily related to the million funding of collateral restricted cash for the company s cash secured term loan 
in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
during fiscal  one of our priorities was to pursue opportunities that would enable us to reduce our interest expense and extend the maturities of our debt 
with this focus  we decided to offer to exchange our mandatory convertible subordinated notes and tangible equity units for common stock at a premium 
we also completed underwritten public offerings of million shares of beazer common stock and million tangible equity units teus for net proceeds of million which  net of debt and other financing payments  resulted in net cash provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended september  in addition  in fiscal  we completed a million senior secured debt offering  net proceeds of which were used to redeem our outstanding senior secured notes and repurchase a portion of our senior notes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  primarily related to borrowings under our cash secured term loan and our completion of a million senior unsecured debt offering  million net proceeds of which was used to redeem our outstanding senior notes and a portion of our and senior notes 
during fiscal  the proceeds received from the issuance of equity securities and new debt was offset by the repurchase of outstanding debt with nearer term maturities 
as a result of the above fiscal transactions  we expect our annualized interest expense to decrease by approximately million 
in july  moody s  s p  and fitch reaffirmed the company s long term debt rating of caa  b  and ccc  respectively 
in september  fitch upgraded their debt rating one notch to b 
these ratings and our current credit condition affect  among other things  our ability to access new capital 
negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt 
our credit ratings could be lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in particular  a weakening of our financial condition  including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows  could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds  could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook  or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing 
we generally fulfill our short term cash requirements with cash generated from our operations and available borrowings 
while we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to participate in a housing recovery  we are mindful of potential short term  or seasonal  requirements for enhanced liquidity that may arise 
as such  we amended and expanded our secured revolving credit facility from million to million during the quarter ended september  we intend to collateralize this amended facility with substantially all of the company s personal property excluding cash and inventories 
in addition  we have entered into a number of stand alone  cash secured letter of credit agreements with banks 
these combined facilities will provide for future working capital and letter of credit needs collateralized by either cash or assets of the company 
we currently have million outstanding letters of credit under these facilities  secured with cash collateral which is maintained in restricted accounts totaling million 
there were no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility at september  we believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at september   cash generated from our operations and the availability of new debt and equity financing  if any  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal in the future  we may from time to time seek to continue to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash repurchases or in exchange for other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in an effort to accelerate our path to profitability  we may seek to expand our business through acquisition  which may be funded through cash  additional debt or equity 
in addition  any material variance from our projected operating results  could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 
stock repurchases and dividends paid the company did not repurchase any shares in the open market during the fiscal years ended september    or any future stock repurchases  as allowed by our debt covenants  must be approved by the company s board of directors or its finance committee 
the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  none of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends 
hence  there were no dividends paid during the fiscal years ended september    or 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual commitments 
at september   we controlled  lots a year supply based on our trailing twelve months of closings 
we owned  or  lots  and  lots   were under option contracts which generally require the payment of cash or the posting of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a certain price 
we historically have attempted to control a portion of our land supply through options 
as a result of the flexibility that these options provide us  upon a change in market conditions we may renegotiate the terms of the options prior to exercise or terminate the agreement 
under option contracts  purchase of the properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers and our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the non refundable deposits and other non refundable amounts incurred  which aggregated approximately million at september  the total remaining purchase price  net of cash deposits  committed under all options was million as of september  when market conditions improve  we may expand our use of option agreements to supplement our owned inventory supply 
we expect to exercise  subject to market conditions and seller satisfaction of contract terms  most of our option contracts 
various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as market conditions  weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities  will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether lot options will be exercised 
we have historically funded the exercise of lot options through a combination of operating cash flows 
we expect these sources to continue to be adequate to fund anticipated future option exercises 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the exercise of our lot options will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we participate in a number of land development joint ventures and other entities in which we have less than a controlling interest 
we enter into unconsolidated entities in order to acquire attractive land positions  to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base 
excluding our investment in a pre owned rental homes reit  the remainder of our investments in our unconsolidated entities are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in our unconsolidated entities under the equity method 
our consolidated balance sheets include investments in unconsolidated entities totaling million and million at september  and september   respectively 
our unconsolidated entities periodically obtain secured acquisition and development financing 
at september   our unconsolidated entities had borrowings outstanding totaling million 
generally  we and our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated entities 
at september   we had one repayment guarantee outstanding for which we have accrued million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable interest commitments under senior notes  senior secured notes other notes payable obligations related to lots under option operating leases uncertain tax positions total excludes million of mandatory convertible subordinated notes which will automatically convert into the company s common stock upon maturity 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of september  due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s unrecognized tax benefits as of september  we had outstanding performance bonds of approximately million at september  related principally to our obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that our exposure in this area is material to our cash flows or earnings 
as of september   we had variable rate debt outstanding totaling approximately million 
a one percent change in the interest rate would not be material to our financial statements 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at september  was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion 
in addition  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rates would increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from billion to billion at september
