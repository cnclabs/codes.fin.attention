executive summary introduction biogen idec is a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases  hemophilia and autoimmune disorders 
patients worldwide benefit from our leading multiple sclerosis therapies  and the company generates billion in annual revenues 
in the near term  our current and future revenues are dependent upon continued sales of our three principal products  avonex  tysabri  and rituxan 
in the longer term  our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products  our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products and assets originating from our research and development efforts  and successful execution of external business development opportunities 
as part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels 
financial highlights the following table is a summary of financial results achieved for the years ended december  change compared to in millions  except per share amounts and percentages total revenues income from operations net income attributable to biogen idec inc diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen idec inc income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc for  was reduced by a charge of million to research and development expense incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with portola pharmaceuticals  inc in october in the second quarter of our share of rituxan revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately million to reflect our share of the approximately million compensatory damages and interest that genentech estimated might be awarded to hoechst gmbh hoechst  in relation to genentech s ongoing arbitration with hoechst 
income from operations for was reduced by approximately million related to the achievement of a milestone by biogen idec hemophilia  inc formerly syntonix pharmaceuticals  inc 
and a million charge incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with knopp neurosciences inc knopp  which we consolidated as we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of this relationship 
the million was partially offset by an attribution of million to the noncontrolling interest 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest also includes a charge of million related to the payment made in to cardiokine biopharma llc cardiokine pursuant to the termination of our lixivaptan collaboration 
income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc  for and  was reduced by million and million  respectively  resulting from charges associated with our restructuring initiative announced in november as described below under results of operations  our operating results for the year ended december   reflect the following worldwide avonex revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of over our share of tysabri revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of over 
table of contents our share of rituxan revenues totaled million for  representing a decrease of from this decrease was primarily the result of royalty expirations in our rest of world markets  a decrease in selling and development expenses incurred by us and reimbursed by genentech  which are also included within our total unconsolidated joint business revenues  and our share of a charge recorded by the collaboration in relation to genentech s ongoing arbitration with hoechst gmbh 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in our share of us rituxan net product revenues which increased over total cost and expenses decreased for compared to this decrease was primarily the result of the million of ipr d charges recognized in as well as a decrease in research and development expense and a decrease in restructuring charges recognized over these decreases were offset by a increase in cost of sales  a increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to tysabri revenue growth  as well as a increase in selling  general and administrative costs over the same period in we generated  million of net cash flows from operations for  which were primarily driven by earnings 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  million as of december  in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million 
business environment we conduct our business primarily within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  which are highly competitive 
many of our competitors are working to develop or have already developed products similar to those we are developing or already market 
for example  along with us  a number of companies are working to develop or have already developed additional treatments for ms  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with avonex  tysabri or both 
in addition  the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates  such as bg  may negatively impact future sales of avonex  tysabri or both 
we may also face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence of biosimilars 
in the us  avonex  tysabri  and rituxan are licensed under the public health service act phsa as biological products 
in march  us healthcare reform legislation amended the phsa to authorize the us food and drug administration fda to approve biological products  known as biosimilars or follow on biologics  that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages 
global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry 
governments in many international markets in which we operate have announced or have already implemented austerity measures to constrain the overall level of government expenditures 
these measures  which include efforts aimed at reforming health care coverage and reducing health care costs  and the deterioration of credit and economic conditions  particularly in certain countries in europe  continue to exert pressure on product pricing  have delayed reimbursement for our products  and have negatively impacted our revenues and results of operations 
for additional information about certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations  please read the risk factors section of this report

we and a number of other companies are working to develop or have already commercialized products to treat ms  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with avonex now and in the future 
in addition  the continued growth of tysabri and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates  such as bg  may negatively impact future sales of avonex 
increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of avonex  as well as increasing price pressure 
tysabri we collaborate with elan pharma international  ltd elan an affiliate of elan corporation  plc  on the development and commercialization of tysabri

increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately and in us tysabri unit sales volume for and   respectively  
table of contents over the prior year comparative periods 
the increase in us tysabri revenues for compared to  resulting from increased commercial demand and price increases  was offset by the sale to elan of previously written down tysabri inventory which became saleable following the approval of our higher yielding manufacturing process 
as our sales price to elan in the us is set to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin with elan plus reimbursement for our cost of goods sold  the distribution of this specific inventory reduced our cost of sales  which reduced the price per unit we charged to elan and reduced our revenues by million in compared to this inventory was fully utilized during net sales of tysabri from our collaboration partner  elan  to third party customers in the us for   and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in rest of world tysabri revenues reflects an increase in commercial demand offset by price decreases in some countries 
increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately and in rest of world tysabri unit sales for and  respectively  over their prior year comparative periods

the increase in rest of world tysabri revenues for compared to reflects gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
in the fourth quarter of  biogen idec srl received a notice from the italian national medicines agency aifa stating that sales of tysabri for the period from february through february exceeded by eur million a reimbursement limit established pursuant to a price determination resolution price resolution granted by aifa in february in december  we filed an appeal against aifa seeking a ruling that our interpretation of the price resolution is valid and that the position of aifa is unenforceable 
while we believe that we have good and valid grounds for our appeal  an unfavorable decision could negatively impact our results of operations 
as a result of this dispute  we deferred million of revenue recognized on sales of tysabri made in italy during the fourth quarter of and expect that we will continue to defer a portion of our revenues on future sales of tysabri in italy until this matter is resolved 
for additional information  please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report 
losses recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaled million in  compared to gains recognized of million for and losses recognized of million we expect tysabri to continue facing increased competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world 
we and a number of other companies are working to develop or have already commercialized products to treat ms  including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with tysabri now and in the future 
the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates  such as bg  also may negatively impact future sales of tysabri 
increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of tysabri  as well as increasing price pressure 
in addition  safety warnings included in the tysabri label  such as the risk of pml  and any future safety related label changes  may limit the growth of tysabri unit sales 
we continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients 
our efforts to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing pml  including through the jcv assay  and other ongoing or future clinical trials involving tysabri may have a negative impact on prescribing behavior in at least the short term  which may result in decreased product revenues from sales of tysabri

increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately and in us rituxan unit sales volume for and 
table of contents  respectively  over their prior year comparative periods 
the increases for both comparative periods were negatively impacted by increases in reserves established for rebates and allowances related to the us healthcare reform legislation enacted in march collaboration cost and expenses for compared to  as well as for compared to  were favorably impacted by genentech assuming responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts for rituxan in the fourth quarter of the savings realized from the consolidation of the sales force in were offset by a charge of approximately million recorded to the collaboration  representing an estimate of compensatory damages and interest that might be awarded to hoechst gmbh hoechst  in relation to an intermediate decision by the arbitrator in genentech s ongoing arbitration with hoechst 
as a result of this charge to the collaboration  our share of rituxan revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately million in the second quarter of this million amount reflects the estimate of the loss that we may incur in the event of a final arbitration award unfavorable to genentech 
the actual amount of our share of any damages may vary from this estimate depending on the nature or amount of any damages awarded to hoechst  or if the arbitrator s final decision is successfully challenged by genentech 
for additional information related to this matter  please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report 
in addition  total collaboration cost and expenses for was further negatively impacted by a new fee which became payable in by all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers 
this fee is calculated based upon each organization s percentage share of total branded prescription drug sales to qualifying us government programs such as medicare  medicaid and va and phs discount programs 
we have reduced our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us by approximately million in based upon our estimate of the fee that will be assessed to genentech on qualifying sales of rituxan in under our collaboration agreement  our current pre tax co promotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  provides for a share of pre tax co promotion profits if co promotion operating profits exceed million 
for   and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
reimbursement of selling and development expense in the us in the fourth quarter of  we and genentech made an operational decision under which we eliminated our rituxan oncology and rheumatology sales force  with genentech assuming responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts related to rituxan 
as a result of this change  selling and development expense incurred by us in the us and reimbursed by genentech decreased for in comparison to  as well as for compared to as discussed in note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of pre tax co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenues 
revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the decline in revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world was due to the expirations of royalties on a country by country basis in certain of our rest of world markets 
in addition  revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world for were favorably impacted by receipt of million representing the cumulative underpayment of past royalties owed to us on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
the royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
the royalty periods for substantially all of the remaining royalty bearing sales of rituxan in the rest of world markets will expire in as a result of these expirations  we expect royalty revenues on sales of rituxan in the rest of world to continue to decline in after  we expect revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world will primarily be limited to our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada 

table of contents other revenues other revenues are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages royalty revenues corporate partner revenues total other revenues royalty revenues we receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own 
sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition  manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control 
in addition  the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in royalty revenues was primarily the result of an increase in sales of angiomax  which was licensed to the medicines company tmc 
royalty revenues from the net worldwide sales of angiomax are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with tmc 
the royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year 
the increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year 
this formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters and  as a result  an adjustment is recorded in the periods in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved 
the increase in royalty revenues related to the sale of angiomax for compared to reflects a million adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of  as net sales levels for achieved a new royalty tier 
under the terms of our agreement  tmc is obligated to pay us royalties earned  on a country by country basis  until the later of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of angiomax in such country or the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent in such country 
the annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share 
tmc began selling angiomax in the us in january the principal us patent that covers angiomax patent was due to expire in march and tmc applied for an extension of the term of this patent 
initially  the us patent and trademark office pto rejected tmc s application because in its view the application was not timely filed 
tmc sued the pto in federal district court seeking to extend the term of the patent to december on august   the federal district court ordered the pto to deem the application as timely filed 
a generic manufacturer challenged the federal district court s order in an appellate proceeding  but on january  the manufacturer filed a motion to dismiss its appeal 
the pto has granted an interim extension of the patent term until august  pending completion of its review of tmc s application for extension to december in the event that tmc is unsuccessful in obtaining a patent term extension to december and third parties sell products comparable to angiomax  we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to increased competition  which may impact sales and result in lower royalty tiered rates 
corporate partner revenues we have also sold or exclusively licensed to third parties rights to certain products previously included within our product line 
supply agreement revenues received based upon those products are recorded as corporate partner revenue 
amounts recorded as corporate partner revenue also include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements 

table of contents for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing activity 
corporate partner revenues for also includes a one time cash payment of approximately million received in exchange for entering into an asset transfer agreement in march related to two research and development programs that were discontinued in connection with our november restructuring initiative 
reserves for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veterans administration va and public health service phs discounts  managed care rebates  product returns  and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of international markets in which we operate 
reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable if the amount is payable to our direct customer or a liability if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer 
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
our estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  and forecasted customer buying patterns 
actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates 
if actual results vary  we will need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
reserves for discounts  contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages discounts contractual adjustments returns total allowances gross product revenues percent of gross product revenues discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term and volume discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases and increased sales 
contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid and managed care rebates  va and phs discounts and other government rebates or applicable allowances 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in contractual adjustments was due to higher reserves for managed care and medicaid and va programs principally associated with price increases in the us and an increase in contractual rates as well as an increase in governmental rebates and allowances associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate 
product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  return reserves remained relatively unchanged

these increases were partially offset by the sale of inventory produced under our high titer production process 
cost of sales for also includes increased costs associated with avonex pen  the jc virus antibody assay  and sales of fampyra  while cost of sales for included million of period expense related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina rtp 
for compared to  the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher unit sales volumes  increased contract manufacturing activity as well as million of period expense incurred related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in rtp 
this comparative increase was offset by the sale of previously written down tysabri inventory  which became saleable following approval of our new higher yielding manufacturing process 
the distribution of this inventory  which was fully utilized during  reduced our cost of sales by million compared to in addition  the sale of inventory produced under our new high titer production process reduced our cost of sales by million compared to we expect an increase in total cost of sales for compared to  as a result of higher expected sales volumes and increased contract manufacturing activity 
our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
the expiry associated with our inventory is generally between months and years  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant

these decreases were offset by research and development costs associated with initiatives to grow our business  which include increased clinical trial activity for certain of our late stage product candidates  such as dexpramipexole  factor viii  factor ix  and pegylated interferon beta a 
research and development expense for compared to  also reflects a reduction in milestone and upfront payments recognized within research and development expense 
for compared to  research and development expense decreased by million 
this decrease reflects a reduction in milestone and upfront payments recognized within research and development expense and a reduction in spending in certain deprioritized programs offset by increased clinical activity for our daclizumab  pegylated interferon beta a  neublastin  factor viii and factor ix programs as well as efforts to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients treated with tysabri 
in addition  our costs for the factor viii and factor ix programs increased in following the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with swedish orphan biovitrum  whereby we assumed full development and manufacturing responsibilities for these programs 
we intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated 
specifically  we intend to continue to make significant investments in the advancement of bg and our factor viii and factor ix hemophilia programs 
we also intend to continue to invest in bringing forward our ms pipeline and in pursuing therapies for other neurodegenerative diseases 
we expect total research and development expense in to be between and of total revenue  and as a result  we expect a modest increase in total research and development expense for compared to milestone and upfront payments included in research and development expense milestone and upfront payments to our collaboration partners  included within research and development expense  totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively

for compared to  the decrease in milestone and upfront payments was primarily the result of the million upfront payment made to acorda in the timing of future upfront fees and milestone payments may cause variability in future research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages selling  general and administrative 
table of contents for compared to  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to initiatives to grow our business  the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increased sales and marketing activities in support of avonex and tysabri  as well as costs incurred in support of the potential launch of bg  offset by a decrease in grant and sponsorship activity and savings realized through our restructuring initiatives  which are described below under the heading restructuring charge

mullen  who retired as our president and chief executive officer on june  for compared to  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of avonex and tysabri  the incremental charges related to the transition agreement with mr 
mullen discussed above  and increased grant and sponsorship activity 
we expect total selling  general and administrative expense in to be between and of total revenue 
the expected increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to be incurred in over is related to the development of sales force and promotional spending in support of fampyra and the potential launches of bg and our factor viii and factor ix programs

amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets for compared to  as well as for compared to  the change in amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily driven by the amount of amortization recorded in relation to our avonex core technology asset 
amortization for acquired intangible assets is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million annually through avonex core technology asset our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product 
we refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model  which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the 
table of contents product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenues of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption model 
we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset 
the results of our long range planning cycle completed in the third quarter of  were most significantly impacted by the issuance in the us of the avonex patent in september as a result of the increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of avonex and the extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset  amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of decreased significantly from those amounts recorded during the first half of amortization recorded for the first and second quarters of was also recorded based upon the results of the analysis 
the results of our analysis completed in the third quarter of did not result in a significant change in the expected lifetime revenues of avonex  and as a result  amortization recorded in the third and fourth quarters of and the first two quarters of were comparable to amounts recorded in the previous four quarters 
our most recent long range planning cycle was completed in the third quarter of  which reflected a further increase in the expected lifetime revenue of avonex 
this most recent increase in the expected lifetime revenues of avonex was primarily attributable to changes in expected impact of competitor products 
as a result  amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of decreased from those amounts recorded in the first half of based upon this most recent analysis  amortization of our core intangible asset related to avonex is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million annually through we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event  such as the invalidation of our avonex patent  could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations

these savings  which are expected to approximate million annually  are offset by costs associated with initiatives to grow our business 
we have also increased our workforce to support our growth initiatives  including efforts to bring forward our late stage pipeline 
costs associated with our workforce reduction are primarily related to employee severance and benefits

income tax provision for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages effective tax rate on pre tax income income tax expense our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations 
the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions  changes in tax laws  the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses  acquisitions and licensing transactions 
our effective tax rate for compared to decreased primarily due to our license and collaboration agreement with knopp  which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of million of the associated ipr d charge 
as such  the attributed amount did not generate a tax deduction  causing our tax rate to be unfavorably impacted by 
in addition  during  we experienced an increase in research and development expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit  a lower effective state tax rate resulting from a change in state law and the settlement of outstanding matters related to state and federal audits 
these favorable items were offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions  principally the us  and a non deductible charge for contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of panima 
for compared to  our effective tax rate was negatively impacted due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of million of the ipr d charge related to our license agreement with knopp 
the impact of the knopp transaction was partially offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in lower rate international jurisdictions in this change in the location of our relative profits was caused by the growth of our international operations and lower domestic earnings as a proportion of total consolidated earnings 
during  we also experienced a favorable impact on our effective tax rates due to a statutory increase in the us manufacturers tax deduction and an increase in expenditures eligible for our orphan drug credit 
in addition  our effective tax rate was increased by as a result of the million upfront payment incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with acorda in the second quarter of our effective tax rate for was also favorably impacted by for changes in tax law which became effective during the first quarter of in certain state jurisdictions in which we operate and the favorable resolution of certain federal  state and foreign tax audits 
the resolution of these tax audits resulted in a reduction of our reserves for several uncertain tax positions  which had a favorable impact of on our effective tax rate 

table of contents our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the allocation of our profits amongst jurisdictions  the percentage of our earnings which are subject to taxation in the us and our level of deductible research and development spending 
during we expect our effective tax rate to be between and 
we expect this decrease in rate due to higher clinical trial spending on orphan drug credit eligible programs  including the phase iii studies for factor viii  factor ix and dexpramipexole  and the cessation of certain inter company royalties owed by a foreign affiliate of ours to a us affiliate  on the international sales of one of our products

new cambridge leases in july  we executed leases for two office buildings to be built in cambridge  massachusetts with a planned occupancy during the second half of construction of these facilities began in late these buildings will serve as the future location of our corporate headquarters and commercial operations 
these buildings will also provide additional general and administrative and research and development office space 
as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters and centralize our campus in cambridge  massachusetts  we expect to vacate our weston  massachusetts facility upon completion of the new buildings 
based upon our most recent estimates  we expect to incur a charge of approximately million upon vacating this facility when the new cambridge buildings have been completed 
this amount represents our remaining weston lease obligation  net of our estimate of sublease income expected to be recovered 
in addition  this 
table of contents decision has also resulted in a change in the expected useful lives of certain leasehold improvements and other assets  which have been shortened due to our anticipated departure from this facility and will result in approximately million of additional depreciation that will be realized ratably from the third quarter of through the date upon which we expect to vacate the weston facility 
approximately million of this additional depreciation was recognized in market risk we conduct business globally 
as a result  our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks which may affect our results of operations  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars  the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results  often in ways that are difficult to predict 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currencies decreases  conversely  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the relative amount of such sales in us dollars increases 
our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of our foreign currency hedging program  which is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
other foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations are recognized in the period in which we incur those gains or losses 
in addition  there is speculation that due to the global economic downturn the future of the euro may be uncertain 
a significant number of our foreign subsidiaries have the euro as their local currency 
in the event that certain countries  such as greece  abandon the euro the resultant macroeconomic impact remains unknown 
an abandonment of the euro  in any or all of the countries in which we operate  could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
our balance sheet exposure to greece is limited as our only receivables in this market are due from our distributor  which totaled approximately million as of december  in addition  we maintain no investment holdings backed by the greek government 
pricing pressure global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry 
the global economic downturn and the deterioration of credit and economic conditions continue to impact our results of operations  particularly in countries where government sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare 
global economic conditions may be further impacted by additional negative economic developments in countries such as france  italy  portugal and spain  whose sovereign debt obligations were recently downgraded and greece  which is facing possible default of its sovereign debt obligations 
as a result  many countries worldwide  particularly those within the european union  are reducing their public expenditures in an effort to achieve cost savings 
governments in a number of international markets  in which we operate  including germany  france  italy  the united kingdom and spain have announced or implemented austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs to constrain the overall level of government expenditures 
the implementation of measures varies by country and include among other things  mandatory rebates and discounts  price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals 
certain implemented measures have already negatively impacted our revenues throughout and we expect to see continued efforts to achieve additional reductions in public expenditures and consequently expect that our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these  similar or more extensive measures are  or continue to be  implemented in these and other 
table of contents countries in which we operate 
based upon our most recent estimates  we expect such measures will reduce our revenues in by approximately to million 
in addition  certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed 
thus  our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets and limit market growth 
the continued implementation of pricing actions throughout europe may also lead to higher levels of parallel trade 
recent austerity measures that have or are expected to impact our results of operations include  but are not limited to  the following france avonex reimbursement rates are subject to periodic pricing review 
following a therapeutic class review  revised prices for interferons and glatiramer acetate have recently been published in france 
as a result  the price of avonex and avonex pen will be reduced by effective april  and october   respectively 
we do not expect a change in tysabri pricing during in september  the french government announced that the national target for expenditures in public healthcare has been significantly reduced in an effort to decrease the social security deficit 
to achieve this goal  additional austerity measures are being implemented  including an increase in the local pharmaceutical tax from to 
additional measures to reduce pricing and reimbursement rates and eligibility are expected 
our negotiations to establish the price of fampyra will be subject to such measures 
germany effective august  the german government enacted a three year freeze on drug price increases lasting through the end of and increased the mandatory rebate on drugs not covered by the reference pricing system from to 
as a result  sales of avonex  tysabri  fumaderm and fampyra have been  and will continue to be  negatively impacted 
in addition  the german government further implemented additional legislation in to manage pricing associated with new drug products introduced to the german market 
under this most recent legislation  drug manufacturers will have one year from the introduction of a new drug to agree pricing with health insurers and requires manufacturers to prove that the new drug product provides some form of added clinical benefit compared to existing drugs or it will be included in a reference pricing scheme 
these new drug product pricing regulations may negatively impact revenues on sales of fampyra beginning in the second half of italy in december  the italian government approved emergency austerity and growth measures aimed at stabilizing and growing the local economy as well as balancing the country s budget by included within these austerity measures are actions to reduce pharmaceutical and healthcare spending which include limiting the reimbursement of prescription drugs  however  most of the cost cutting measures in the austerity package related to pharmaceutical spending are due to be introduced in and in addition to these actions  additional measures may be implemented in which may impact revenues on future sales 
accordingly  the impact on revenues on sales of avonex  tysabri and fampyra resulting from these expected actions in future periods is uncertain 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  biogen idec italia srl received a notice from the italian national medicines agency aifa stating that sales of tysabri for the period from february through february exceeded by euro million a reimbursement limit established pursuant to a price determination resolution price resolution granted by aifa in february in december  we filed an appeal against aifa seeking a ruling that our interpretation of the price resolution is valid and that the position of aifa is unenforceable 
while we believe that we have good and valid grounds for our appeal  an unfavorable decision could negatively impact our results of operations 
as a result of this dispute  we deferred million of revenue recognized on sales of tysabri in italy in the fourth quarter of and expect that we will continue to defer a portion of our revenues on future sales of tysabri in italy until this matter is resolved 
for additional information  please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report 
spain our operations in spain have been negatively impacted by the implementation of an incremental rebate  which became effective in june  on all branded drugs reimbursed under the spanish national health system 
as a result  sales of avonex and tysabri have been negatively impacted 

table of contents additional discounts could be implemented beginning in mid year  which may negatively affect revenues on sales of our products in spain in future periods 
a periodic pricing review of tysabri is also expected in united kingdom avonex pricing is subject to the multiple sclerosis risk sharing scheme  which aims to ensure that therapies can be purchased at a cost effective price as assessed by the national institute of health and clinical excellence nice 
clinical outcomes from treated patients are entered into a health economic model  which allows monitoring of the cost effectiveness of each of the drugs in the scheme 
actual and expected benefits of the drugs are compared and if there is a significant shortfall in actual compared to expected benefit for a particular product  the price of the product may be reduced 
the results of this most recent analysis are expected in the second half of in addition  while no specific price cuts have been imposed to date in the united kingdom  measures to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures are also being considered 
the implementation of these measures may negatively affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the us and europe with concentrations of credit risk limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products  as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas 
our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale distributors  public hospitals and other government entities 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present challenges 
we continue to monitor these conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets  and assess their possible impact on our business 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant 
within the european union  our accounts receivable in italy  spain  and portugal continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
the credit and economic conditions within these countries have continued to deteriorate 
these conditions have increased  and may continue to increase  the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 
our accounts receivable exposure to greece is limited as our only receivables in this market are due from our distributor 
although our contractual payment terms have not changed  over the past year we have noted a lengthening in the time period required to collect accounts receivable balance in certain countries 
in countries where we expect to collect receivables greater than one year  at the time of sale  we have discounted our revenues over the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid using our estimate of the country s borrowing rate 
the related receivables are classified at the time of sale as long term assets 
our net accounts receivable balances from product sales in these countries are summarized as follows as of december  in millions current balance included within accounts receivable  net non current balance included within investments and other assets total spain italy portugal greece as of december  in millions current balance included within accounts receivable  net non current balance included within investments and other assets total spain italy portugal greece

as of december   our accounts receivable balances in italy totaled million  all of which resulted from sales of product subsequent to june  in may  european union finance ministers approved a three year eur billion rescue package for portugal 
under the terms of the package  portugal is required to correct its excessive deficit by and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its health care system  including through austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs 
these measures include plans to standardize control procedures to reduce outstanding balances payable to drug suppliers 
in december  the international monetary fund imf approved the second review of portugal s progress under the rescue program  noting both that portugal s program remained broadly on track but that a continued deterioration of the economic conditions in europe remains a serious risk 
we will continue to monitor portugal s progress against program targets and assess the collectability of our outstanding receivables within this market 
our concentrations of credit risk related to our accounts receivable from product sales in greece to date have been limited as our receivables within this market are due from our distributor 
as of december  and december   our accounts receivable balances due from this distributor totaled million and million  respectively 
these receivables remain current and substantially in compliance with their contractual due dates 
however  the majority of the sales by our distributor are to government funded hospitals and as a result our distributor maintains significant outstanding receivables with the government of greece  which remains in a deep recession 
in the event that greece defaults on its debt and is unable to pay our distributor  we may be unable to collect some or all of our remaining amounts due from the distributor 
in addition  the government of greece may also require pharmaceutical creditors to accept mandatory  retroactive  price deductions in settlement of outstanding receivables and in this event we could be required to repay our distributor a portion of the amounts they have previously remitted to us 
to date  we have not been required to repay such amounts to our distributor or take a discount in settlement of any outstanding receivables 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of december  and  respectively  however  if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments  we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected

for example  we limit our exposure to european sovereign debt securities and maintain no holdings with respect to certain euro zone states  such as portugal  italy  greece  and spain 
the value of our investments  however  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the credit rating of the corporate bonds included in our portfolio  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in declines in the value of the investments

the reduction in total current liabilities primarily reflects the decrease in taxes payable and the derecognition of the financing arrangement liability upon our recognition of the sale of the san diego facility on august  for additional information related to the financing arrangement associated with our october sale and subsequent leaseback of the san diego facility  please read note  property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements included within this report 
cash flows our net cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  change compared to compared to in millions  except percentages net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used in provided by investing activities net cash flows used in financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital 
we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and share based compensation charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations  and changes associated with the payment of contingent milestones associated with our prior acquisitions of businesses 
for compared to  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in net income primarily resulting from increased product revenues and million in proceeds from domp farmaceutici spa for the purchase of biogen domp srl s outstanding receivables  offset by increased inventory balances and lower liabilities 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we reached agreement with the irs on the timing of the recognition of certain income and expense items 
the effect of this agreement is primarily limited to the timing of these items  resulting in lower actual tax payments for and higher expected payments in subsequent periods 
this agreement will have an insignificant effect on our income tax expense for all periods and no effect on our contingencies for uncertain tax positions 
for compared to  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased revenues and lower payments for us federal income taxes offset by an increase in accounts receivable and receivables due from unconsolidated joint business 
investing activities for compared to  the decrease in net cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of marketable securities 
net purchases of marketable securities totaled  million in  compared to proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
table of contents totaling million in net cash flows used in investing activities for also reflect million in net payments made to knopp under our license and stock purchase agreements 
for compared to  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by the payments made to knopp under our license and stock purchase agreements  the million payment made upon our acquisition of panima  our purchases of property  plant and equipment and the milestone payment made to the former shareholders of syntonix 
net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities in totaled million compared to net purchases of million made in financing activities for compared to  the decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities is due primarily to a decrease in the amounts of our common stock we repurchased and higher proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements in  offset by the million of payments made in for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in biogen domp srl and biogen domp switzerland gmbh 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million compared to million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately billion in in addition  we received million in compared to million in  related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash used in financing activities during  also includes the repayment of amounts outstanding under biogen domp srl s line of credit in connection with our recent purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investment in biogen domp srl 
for compared to  the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increases in the amounts of our common stock repurchased compared to the same period in in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately billion compared to million shares at a cost of approximately million in cash used in financing activities also includes the in net proceeds from the sale of the san diego facility  which was accounted for as a financing arrangement until august  and activity under our employee stock plans 
we received million in compared to million in  related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan

in  we acquired fumapharm ag 
as part of this acquisition we acquired fumaderm and bg together  fumapharm products 
we paid million upon closing of the transaction and will pay an additional million if a fumapharm product is approved for ms in the us or us we may also make the following additional milestone payments to fumapharm ag based on the attainment of certain sales levels of fumapharm products  less certain costs as defined in the acquisition agreement cumulative sales level prior month sales m b b b each additional b up to b payment amount in millions million million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion these milestone payments are considered contingent consideration and will be accounted for as an increase to goodwill as incurred  in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to business combinations when we acquired fumapharm 
milestone payments are due within days following the end of the quarter in which the applicable sales level has been reached and are based upon the total sales of fumapharm products in the prior twelve month period 
financing arrangement in july  we executed leases for two office buildings to be built in cambridge  massachusetts with a planned occupancy during the second half of construction of these facilities began in late in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed  we are considered the owner  for accounting purposes  of these properties during the construction period 
accordingly  we will record an asset along with a corresponding financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for the amount of total project costs incurred related to the construction in progress for these buildings through completion of the construction period 
upon completion of the buildings  we will assess and determine if the assets and corresponding liabilities should be derecognized 
as 
table of contents of december   cost incurred in relation to the construction of these buildings totaled approximately million 
the future payments related to these leases have been included in the above chart of contractual obligations 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary 
legal matters for a discussion of legal matters as of december   please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant areas involving estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances  collaborative relationships  clinical trial expenses  consolidation of variable interest entities  valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination  valuation of acquired intangible assets  including in process research and development  inventory  impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill  investments  including fair value measures and impairments  share based compensation  income taxes  and contingencies 
revenue recognition and related allowances we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery 
however  sales of tysabri in the us are recognized on the sell through model  
table of contents that is  upon shipment of the product by elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to elan 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
reserves for discounts and allowances we establish reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid and managed care rebates  veterans administration and phs discounts  product returns and other governmental discounts or applicable allowances associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of international markets in which we operate 
these reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
our estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
in addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue  we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management and distribution services 
we have established the fair value of these services and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense 
if we had concluded that we did not receive a separate identifiable benefit or have sufficient evidence that the fair value did not exist for these services  we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business we collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us  reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the us  and revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world  which consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche and its sublicensees 
pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by genentech in the us and by roche in canada 
pre tax co promotion profits consist of us and canadian sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  and distribution  selling and marketing  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech  roche and us 
we record our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us on a cash basis 
additionally  our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in the us includes estimates made by genentech and those estimates are subject to change 
actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates 
bad debt reserves bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
given our historical experience with bad debts  combined with our credit management policies and practices  we do not presently maintain significant bad debt reserves 
however certain of our customers are based in countries where the economic conditions continue to present challenges 
we continue to monitor these conditions and associated impacts on the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not exceeded management s estimates 
concentrations of credit risk the majority of our receivables arise from product sales in the united states and europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors  large pharmaceutical companies  public hospitals and other government entities 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies  and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business  especially in light of the global economic downturn 
the credit and economic conditions within many of the international markets in which we operate  particularly in certain countries throughout europe  such 
table of contents as italy  spain and portugal  have continued to deteriorate throughout these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 
to date  we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable 
if economic conditions worsen and or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate  our risk of collectability may increase  which may result in additional allowances and or significant bad debts 
for additional information about related to our concentration of credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances  please read the subsection above entitled credit risk in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report 
royalty revenues we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues  we record such revenues on a cash basis 
collaborative relationships we evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity 
amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense  except as discussed in note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed within note  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of pre tax co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue 
for collaborations with commercialized products  if we are the principal  we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income 
if we are not the principal  we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
for such consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than of the economics  we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  we consider a number of factors  including our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity s economic success  
table of contents our contractual rights and responsibilities under the arrangement and the significance of the arrangement to each party 
these considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative and joint venture relationships and may result in the future consolidation of companies or entities with which we have collaborative or other arrangements 
valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination for acquisitions completed after january   we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones  or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
these fair value measurements represent level measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  changes in assumptions described above  could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
valuation of acquired intangible assets  including in process research and development we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process research and development product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
prior to january   we measured acquired ipr d in a business combination at fair value and expensed it on acquisition date if that technology lacked an alternative future use  or capitalized it as an intangible asset if certain criteria were met  however  effective january   if we are purchasing a business  the acquired ipr d is measured at fair value  capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually until commercialization  after which time the ipr d is amortized over its estimated useful life 
if we acquire an asset or group of assets  that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting 
table of contents standards  then the acquired ipr d is expensed on its acquisition date 
future costs to develop these assets are recorded to expense as they are incurred if the technology lacks alternative future uses 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined in a manner that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
capitalization of inventory costs our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process  including any known safety or efficacy concerns  potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
we expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
obsolescence and unmarketable inventory we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
in the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration  we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value 
impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill long lived assets other than goodwill long lived assets to be held and used  including property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  including its eventual residual value  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 

table of contents our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
we believe the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product  which we refer to as the economic consumption amortization model 
this amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated product sales of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model 
this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales of avonex and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset  the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances  due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise 
we completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of based upon this analysis  amortization of our core intangible asset related to avonex is expected to be in the range of million to million annually through we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event  such as the invalidation of our avonex patent  could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets during  and goodwill goodwill totaled approximately  million as of december   and relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of biogen  inc and idec pharmaceuticals corporation 
our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually  as of october  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
the provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this newly issued accounting standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step impairment test 
this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   which for biogen idec means january  early adoption is permitted  however  we have not elected to do so 
for additional information related to this new accounting standard  please read the section entitled new accounting pronouncements within note  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included within this report 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
in each year  the fair value of our reporting unit  which includes goodwill  was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit 

table of contents investments  including fair value measures and impairments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes  government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
as noted in note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  a majority of our financial assets have been classified as level these assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets 
we also have some investments classified as level whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies 
we apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our share based compensation arrangements 
changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment  and includes estimating the expected market price of our stock on vesting date and stock price volatility as well as the term of the expected awards 
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets requires judgment  including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets 
the 
table of contents estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the performance as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
we also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors  these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to materially differ  from our estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction s tax laws and regulations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors  that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   our non us subsidiaries undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings and other basis differences aggregated approximately billion 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us  however  if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs  the resultant tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations 
the residual us tax liability  if such amounts were remitted  would be approximately million to million as of december  contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional 
table of contents information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
these revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations or maintain distribution relationships in the us  europe  middle east  canada  central and south america  australia  new zealand  japan  china  india and elsewhere in asia in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri and in germany in connection with the sale of fumaderm 
we also launched fampyra in australia and certain european countries during the second half of in addition  we receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily with respect to the euro  canadian dollar  swiss franc  danish krone  swedish krona  british pound  and japanese yen 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
the majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items 
we have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items 
the following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs 
as of december  and  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
as of december  and  we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
