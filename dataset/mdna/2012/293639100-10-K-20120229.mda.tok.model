table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  with a nationwide portfolio in excess of stations in markets  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento and kansas city 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
net revenues are gross revenues minus agency commissions 
the revenues are determined by the advertising rates charged and the number of advertisements broadcast 
we maximize our revenues by managing the inventory of advertising spots available for broadcast  which can vary throughout the day but is consistent over time 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the region in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by an independent advertising sales representative 
local and national revenues include revenues from the sale of advertising on our stations websites  the sale of advertising during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet  and e commerce 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation and non spot revenue 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  programming and promotional expenses 
other significant expenses that impact our profitability are interest and depreciation and amortization expense 
our performance is based upon the aggregate performance of our radio stations 
the following are some of the factors that impact a radio station s performance at any given time i audience ratings  ii program content  iii management talent and expertise  iv sales talent and expertise  v audience characteristics  vi signal strength  and vii the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the associated risks and uncertainties 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  under the heading same station consideration  we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
same station comparisons are used by us and those in the industry to assess the effect of acquisitions and dispositions on our operations throughout the periods measured 

table of contents the following transactions were evaluated for same station consideration on january  we commenced operations under a time brokerage agreement tba of kufx fm  a station licensed to san jose  california 
during january  we began simulcasting the format of kufx fm on the frequency of one of the three san francisco stations we own and operate  thereby providing a complement to the signal coverage of the kufx fm format in the san francisco metropolitan market 
on february   we acquired kufx fm 
we did not consider the operation nor ownership of kufx fm as impacting our same station computations as the operation of kufx fm allows us to enhance an existing station s listening audience 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operation of a number of our tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of certain non strategic tower sites  which also impacted same station considerations when comparing the years with results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on february   we acquired kufx fm  a station in san jose  california  for million in cash 
we began operating this station on january  under a tba that in increased our station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
in  we incurred million in merger and acquisition costs from legal and advisory expenses from an unsuccessful effort to acquire a large radio group operator  and lease abandonment costs associated with the acquisition of kufx fm 
financing during november  we refinanced our existing debt by entering into a new senior secured credit facility and new unsecured senior notes that increased our interest expense due to an increase in fees incurred under these agreements on our outstanding debt  and an increase in deferred financing expense  which will be amortized over the terms of the new debt agreements  and a loss on extinguishment of debt 
during march  we amended our senior credit agreement the amendment to our former facility that increased our interest expense due to an increase in deferred financing expense of million  which was scheduled to be amortized over the remaining term of the former facility subject to early extinguishment due to the november  debt refinancing  and an increase in fees incurred under the former facility  primarily on outstanding debt 
during the year ended december   we repurchased the remaining million of our then outstanding senior subordinated notes the notes and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
other during the second quarter of  management determined that on a more likely than not realization basis  a full valuation allowance for our net deferred assets was no longer required 
based on this assessment  management reversed the full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  which was a significant factor in the reduction of our income tax rate in 
table of contents same station consideration there were no adjustments during these periods that impacted same station consideration 
net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change net revenues in decreased in the low single digits compared to contributing factors to our lower net revenues were format changes in a few of our key markets  overall market weakness in several markets where we operate and generally sluggishness in advertiser demand 
we believe  however  that the new formats will improve the longer term growth prospects for these brands 
net revenues increased in the majority of our markets 
our net revenues increased the most for those radio stations located in our indianapolis  kansas city and seattle markets  offset by a decrease for those radio stations located in our boston  denver and san francisco markets 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in our audience ratings expense primarily due to the continued rollout across our markets of ppm  a new audience measurement methodology  costs associated with the continued expansion of our digital initiatives  and an increase in employee compensation and benefits related to the lifting of our multi year wage freeze at the beginning of the year and the reinstatement of our k employer contribution 
depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to the decrease over the past several years in acquisitions  and capital expenditures 

table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in non cash compensation expense of million primarily due to the amortization of share based compensation awards that were granted during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of operating income years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the decrease in operating income was primarily due to an increase in station operating expenses  net of revenues  for the reasons described above under station operating expenses  an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses for the reasons described under corporate general and administrative expenses  and an increase of million in merger and acquisition costs 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decline in the average interest rate primarily due to the expiration of certain interest rate hedges that fixed a portion of our variable rate debt at a higher rate than the current short term eurodollar london interbank offered rate libor interest rate  and a decline in outstanding debt upon which interest is computed 
this decrease was offset by the increase in interest associated with the new credit facility and senior notes that were entered into during the fourth quarter of interest expense in is expected to be higher than in due to the refinancing in  offset by the expected reduction in outstanding debt in  and the expiration in of an existing fixed rate interest hedging transaction in the aggregate notional value of million 
under our credit facility and former facility  our interest rate is variable 
the weighted average variable interest rate as of december  and  before taking into account the subsequent year s impact of the company s outstanding derivative interest rate instruments  was and  respectively 

table of contents income before income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income before income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income for the reasons as described above under operating income  a loss on derivative instruments  and a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
this decrease in operating income was offset by a decrease in interest expense for the reasons described under interest expense 
income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change we were impacted by the economic downturn which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and due to these impairment losses and their impact on our three year cumulative income  we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in during the second quarter of  management determined that  on a more likely than not realization basis  this full valuation allowance was no longer required 
contributing to this assessment were sufficient positive indicators such as  but not limited to  the then present economic conditions as compared to the economic conditions when the valuation allowance was established  recent profitability  management s expectation of future profitability  including available future taxable income under the current tax law to realize all of the tax benefits for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards 
in addition  we do not have a history of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in the tax amortization in the early years of the carryforward period as a significant portion of our intangible assets will be fully amortized during that time 
accordingly  the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on this assessment  management determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  which resulted in a tax benefit to the statement of operations for the year ended december  due to the reversal of the full valuation allowance 
we decreased our valuation allowance by to million as of december  from million as of december  for the year ended december   the income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was a tax benefit of 
the income tax expense in would have been at a rate in the low range if the following factors were excluded items that decreased income tax expense the decrease in the valuation allowance of million that includes a million removal of a valuation allowance from accumulated other comprehensive income  an income tax benefit of million associated with the reclassification of an income tax benefit from accumulated other comprehensive income  and an income tax credit for a reduction in liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million  primarily due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations in certain tax jurisdictions 

table of contents items that increased income tax expense a prior period correction resulting in income tax expense of million income tax expense of million associated with non amortizable assets  and a decrease in deferred tax assets of million for the elimination of the federal tax benefit associated with certain state net operating losses nols 
for the year ended december   income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was  which was primarily due to the recording of net deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
these deferred tax liabilities cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense was offset by the reduction in liabilities from uncertain tax positions associated with the expiration of the statutes of limitations in certain tax jurisdictions 
in the event we determine at a future time that it is more likely than not we will not realize our net deferred tax assets  we will increase our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increase income tax expense in the period when we make such determination 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range excluding the effect of recording tax expense associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we anticipate that our rate in could be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have different income tax rates from states in which we currently operate and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions  taxes in certain states that are dependent on factors other than taxable income  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i tax expense associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill  ii regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  iii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iv changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and v changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as of december   net deferred tax liabilities were million 
as of december   net deferred tax liabilities were million 
our net deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under accounting guidance  we do not amortize our indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
the amortization of our indefinite lived assets for tax purposes but not for book purposes creates deferred tax liabilities 
a reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite lived intangibles become impaired  or are sold  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the amortization for tax purposes and not book purposes of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods without consideration for any impairment loss in future periods 
net income years ended december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income loss before income taxes benefit and under income taxes benefit 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year financing during march  we amended our former facility  which increased our interest expense due to an increase in the amortization of deferred financing expense of million and an increase in the on going fees we pay under our former facility 
during march  we repurchased the remaining million of our then outstanding notes at par and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of deferred financing expenses 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our notes and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced operating certain of our tower facilities and we received million in cash that was reflected as financing method lease obligations due to our ability to participate in future profits from these towers 
dispositions during  another party commenced operation of certain tower sites as part of our plan to exit the operation of non strategic tower sites  which decreased net revenues tower rental income and station operating expenses for same station considerations  but had a marginal impact on our reported results of operations 
other during the year ended  we recorded an impairment loss of million in connection with our review of goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further discussion of the contributing factors to the impairment loss 
the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  we reversed the federal portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss carryforward and recovered million in same station consideration during the fourth quarter of  another party commenced the operation of certain of our tower sites 
for purposes of reporting same station information  the operation of these tower sites was eliminated from our reported results for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net revenues would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
station operating expenses would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 
operating income would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income for the transfer of tower operations to a third party as of the beginning of the period 

table of contents net revenues years ended december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change poor economic conditions in led to lower demand for radio advertising 
in  our revenues were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the economy and improving business conditions for both the industry and us 
net revenues in the current period increased in the majority of our markets 
our net revenues increased the most for those radio stations located in our denver  new orleans  rochester and san francisco markets 
station operating expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in net revenues as described above as certain variable expenses increase with a corresponding increase in net revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expense amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to the decrease over the past several years in i capital expenditures  ii deferred charges and other assets  and iii acquisitions 
corporate general and administrative expenses years ended december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change corporate general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in non cash compensation expense  as the equity compensation awards that were granted in were granted late in the year with minimal expense impact  and certain previously granted awards did not affect as they were fully amortized in 
table of contents operating income years ended december  december  dollars in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the increase in operating income was primarily due to the absence of an impairment loss in the current period as compared to an impairment loss of million that was recorded in the second quarter of the prior year  and an increase in net revenues for the reasons described above under net revenues  net of an increase in station operating expenses for the reasons described under station operating expenses 
interest expense years ended december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decline in outstanding debt  the repurchase of our notes  which had a higher interest rate than the funds borrowed to repurchase such notes  and a reduction in january of million in notional value of an existing fixed interest rate swap agreement 
interest rates on outstanding debt remained relatively flat during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was offset by an increase in the amortization of deferred financing expense of million  primarily from the amortization of the bank fees associated with the march amendment to our former facility  and an increase in our former facility fees that correlates to an increase in our leverage ratio during most of the third quarter of and into the fourth quarter of income loss before income taxes benefit years ended december  december  dollars in millions income loss before income taxes benefit amount of change percentage change nmf the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income for the reasons as described above under operating income  which was partially offset by a million decrease in the gain on the retirement of our notes as we repurchased these notes at a discount in

the tax rates for the years ended december  and were impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
income tax expense for was primarily due to the recording of net deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets such as broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
these deferred tax liabilities cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense for the current period was offset by the reduction in liabilities from uncertain tax positions associated with the finalization of an audit by the internal revenue service 
the income tax benefit in was favorably impacted by the passage of tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years 
as a result  in we reversed in excess of million of our valuation allowance for the federal portion of our deferred tax assets 
we were impacted by the economic downturn which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and due to these impairment losses and their impact on our three year cumulative income  we established a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance in after excluding deferred tax liabilities associated with non amortizable assets 
as of december   net deferred tax liabilities were million  which primarily relate to differences between book and tax bases of certain of our indefinite lived intangibles broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
under accounting guidance  we do not amortize our indefinite lived intangibles for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment

net income years ended december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the net change was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income before income taxes benefit and under income taxes benefit 
future impairments we may determine that it will be necessary to take impairment charges in future periods if we determine the carrying value of our intangible assets is more than the fair value 
our annual impairment test of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill was performed in the second quarter of we may be required to retest prior to our next annual evaluation  which could result in a material impairment 
as of december   no interim impairment test was required during for our broadcasting licenses and goodwill 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity over the past several years  we have used a significant portion of our capital resources primarily to reduce our indebtedness 
in years prior to  we used a portion of our capital resources primarily to repurchase shares of our class a common stock  pay dividends to our shareholders and to purchase radio station assets 
generally  our cash requirements are funded from one or a combination of internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our credit agreement 
historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility and million principal amount of our senior notes 
in addition  we have outstanding financing method lease obligations of million and a million letter of credit 
during the year ended december   we decreased our outstanding debt by million and  during the year ended  we decreased our outstanding debt by million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the outstanding debt under our former facility was paid in full on november  with the proceeds from new financing as described below 
our net revenues were lower in as compared to the prior year 
contributing factors to our lower net revenues were the changes in formats in a few of our key markets 
we believe  however  that the new formats will improve the longer term growth prospects for these brands 
while economic conditions in as compared to have somewhat improved  resulting in increased advertiser demand  the economy continues to be weak and plagued by high unemployment 
we anticipate that the industry will benefit from the effects of political advertising in it is difficult for management  however  to forecast revenues for given the current cautiousness of advertisers due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy 
the refinancing the credit facility on november   we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders for a million senior secured credit facility  the credit facility  that is comprised of a a million revolving credit facility  or the revolver  that matures on november   and b a million term loan  or the term b loan  that matures on november  the term b loan amortizes in quarterly installments of million with the first such payment being due and payable on march  and any remaining principal and interest is due at maturity except for certain mandatory principal prepayments of excess cash flow and other events as described below 
we used the proceeds from the revolver  the term b loan and the senior notes to pay all of the outstanding debt under our former facility  along with transaction costs for both the credit facility and the senior notes 
we expect to use the revolver to provide for working capital  and provide for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and any or all of the following subject to certain restrictions repurchases of class a common stock  repurchases of our senior notes  dividends  investments and acquisitions 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  with limited exclusions including our real property 
the assets securing the credit facility are subject to customary release provisions which would enable us to sell such assets free and clear of encumbrance  subject to certain conditions and exceptions 
the undrawn amount of the revolver was million as of december  the amount of the revolver available to us is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing 
based on our financial covenant analysis as of december   we would not be limited in these borrowings 
the credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specific financial covenants 
specifically  our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants which are defined terms within the agreement  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio that cannot exceed times through june  and which decreases over time to times as of march  and thereafter  and 
table of contents a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of times through december   which increases over time to times as of september  and thereafter 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and all other terms of the credit facility as of december  our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants will be highly dependent on our results of operations 
a default under our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes could cause a cross default 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  we may elect an interest rate per annum equal to the libor interest rate plus fees that can range from to for the revolver and from to for the term b loan  or the base rate plus fees that can range from to for the revolver and from to for the term b loan  where the base rate is the highest of a the administrative agent s prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  or c the libor rate plus 
the term b loan includes a libor rate floor of 
in addition  the revolver requires us to pay a commitment fee of per annum for the unused amount of the revolver 
the term b loan requires annual mandatory prepayments equal to of excess cash flow  as defined within the agreement  subject to incremental step downs to  depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  and mandatory prepayments from certain events such as the sale of certain property or the issuance of debt 
we believe that over the next months we can continue to maintain our compliance with these covenants 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next months  including our debt repayments 
our operating cash flow remains positive  and we believe that it is adequate to fund our operating needs 
as a result  we have not been required to rely upon  and we do not anticipate being required to rely upon  the revolver to fund our operations 
we plan to use cash flow from operations to fund the amortization of term b loan 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of our credit facility and any subsequent failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may seek from time to time to amend our credit facility or obtain other funding or additional financing  which may result in higher interest rates 
as of december   our consolidated leverage ratio was times and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was times 
for accounting purposes  the term b loan was treated as new debt while the revolver was treated as a debt modification 
as a result  unamortized deferred financing costs were adjusted during the fourth quarter of as follows the former facility s term loan unamortized deferred financing costs of million were written off as a net loss on extinguishment of debt  and the former facility s revolving credit unamortized deferred financing costs of million were written off as a net loss on extinguishment of debt and million of unamortized deferred financing costs were deferred to be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the revolver 
in addition  we recorded new deferred financing costs of i million for the term b loan that will be amortized under the effective interest rate method over the term  and ii million for the revolver that will be amortized under the straight line method over the term

in addition to the parent  entercom communications corp  all of the company s existing subsidiaries other than entercom radio  llc  which is a finance subsidiary and is the issuer of the senior notes  jointly and severally guaranteed the senior notes 
under certain covenants  our subsidiary guarantors are restricted from paying dividends or distributions in excess of amounts defined under the senior notes  and the subsidiary guarantors are limited in their ability to incur additional indebtedness under certain restrictive covenants 
a default under our senior notes could cause a default under our credit facility 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
our former credit agreement our former facility consisted of a revolving credit facility of million  of which million was outstanding and paid in full as of the refinancing on november   and a term loan of million  of which million was outstanding and paid in full as of the refinancing on november  the former facility was secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in addition  the former facility was secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  with limited exclusions including our real property 
key terms of the former facility were as follows certain financial covenants  which were defined terms within the agreement  required us to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of times  and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of times  and depending on the consolidated leverage ratio  we could elect an interest rate equal to the libor rate plus fees that ranged from to  or the base rate plus fees that ranged from to  where the base rate was the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the libor rate plus  and c the prime rate 
the amendment in march to the former facility was treated as a modification to a debt instrument 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we recorded deferred financing costs of million related to the amendment which were amortized over the remaining life of the former facility on a straight line basis for the revolving credit facility  and an effective interest rate method for the term loan 
in addition  unamortized deferred financing costs of million as of the amendment date were amortized over the remaining life of the former facility 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cash flows from operating activities were down from year to year  as the decrease in working capital of million was offset by a decrease in net revenues and a net increase in station operating expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net revenues  net of station operating expenses  and a recovery in of refundable income taxes 
this increase was offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the increase in net revenues

income tax refunds as a result of federal tax legislation during the fourth quarter of that allowed us to carryback our net operating loss for five years rather than for two years  we recorded in excess of million under prepaid and refundable income taxes as of december  on april   we received million in federal income tax refunds and the remaining balance in dividends we do not currently pay  and have not paid during or  dividends on our common stock 
any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors based upon the relevant factors at the time of such consideration  including  without limitation  compliance with the restrictions set forth in our credit facility

the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of our credit facility 
b under our senior notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
certain leases include contingent rents for common area maintenance 
these amounts are included in minimum operating lease commitments when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably measurable 
financing lease obligations outstanding include principal and interest expense 
when our continuing involvement in this transaction ceases in the year  we expect we will discontinue finance accounting and instead treat our obligations under the accounting guidance for capital and operating leases 
also  we will recognize additional obligations included in the above table that cover lease payments for the period subsequent to the month period of continuing involvement 
the term for each of the leases ranges from to years  which covers the period of continuing involvement and the period subsequent to continuing involvement

table of contents a we have purchase obligations of million including contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
b in addition to the above  we have million in liabilities related to i construction obligations of million  and ii our obligation to provide a million letter of credit 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and our operating results 
it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities  together with liabilities for deferred compensation and uncertain tax positions other than the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that are subject to the expiration of various statutes of limitation over the next months are reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
see note  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax liabilities  including liabilities for unrecognized tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  in the normal course of business  many of our radio stations enter into operating leases for the rental of real property that facilitates the transmission and broadcast of our radio broadcast signal 
we enter into interest rate contracts collars and swaps to hedge our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we have  from time to time  divested certain of our radio stations and assets 
in connection with these divestitures  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as environmental liabilities 
we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however  such insurance may not cover any of  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  such insurance coverage could change in the future 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  in december  we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire a radio station in san jose  california for million in cash 
concurrently with entering into the asset purchase agreement  we entered into a tba and commenced operations on january  accounting guidelines for variable interest entities require that the primary beneficiary consolidate the entity into its financial statements 
as a result of our review  we determined that since we were not the primary beneficiary of this entity  we did not need to include the entity in our consolidated financial statements as of december  as of december   we had no other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents market capitalization as of december  and  our total market capitalization was million and million  respectively  which was million lower and million higher  respectively  than our equity book value on those dates

see note  intangible assets and goodwill  in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment losses in prior years 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate our radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation in  we were not significantly impacted by the effects of inflation on our radio station operating expenses  although the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the accounting guidance was revised to enhance disclosures regarding financial and derivative instruments 
entities are required to provide both net and gross information for these assets and liabilities in order to enhance comparability with international accounting standards 
this new guidance  which will be effective for us as of january   is to be applied retrospectively 
we anticipate that the adoption of this accounting guidance will expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures 
goodwill testing in august  the accounting guidance for how an entity tests goodwill for impairment was revised to simplify the procedures 
the revised guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
prior to this decision  entities were required to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by first comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
this guidance  which will be effective for us as of january   is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the accounting standards for the presentation of comprehensive income were amended 
this guidance was intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance provided by this update becomes effective for us on january  since this guidance will only change the format of financial statements  it is expected that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 

table of contents disclosure of fair value measurements in may  the accounting standards for fair value measurements were amended to clarify existing guidance and require certain new quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding unobservable fair value measurements 
the guidance provided by this update becomes effective for us on january  since this guidance will only require additional disclosures  it is expected that this guidance will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements which impacted  see note in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the amounts of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have generally ranged between and of our outstanding receivables 
our accounts receivable reserve has been in the higher range over the past several years due to the economic uncertainties 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are possible to reasonably result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we were impacted by the economic downturn which resulted in impairments to our broadcast licenses and goodwill in and due to these impairment losses and their impact on cumulative three year income  we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in as we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 

table of contents as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is decreased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is probable 
during the second quarter of  management determined that on a more likely than not realization basis  a portion of the valuation allowance was no longer required 
contributing to this assessment were sufficient positive indicators such as  but not limited to  the present economic conditions as compared to the economic conditions when the valuation allowance was established  recent profitability  management s expectation of future profitability  including available future taxable income under the current tax law to realize all of the tax benefits for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards 
in addition  we do not have a history of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in tax amortization in the early years of the carryforward period as a significant portion of our intangible assets will be fully amortized during that time 
accordingly  the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on this assessment  management determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized and as a result  we reversed our full valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation of accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
excluding discrete items of tax  changes in our valuation allowance and impairment losses  our tax rate over the past several years has varied within a range of high to low 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate as of december  would be an increase in income tax expense of million and a decrease in net income of million net income per basic and diluted share of for the year ended december  valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets at that date 
we must conduct impairment testing at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 

table of contents after an impairment expense is recognized  the recorded value of these assets will be reduced by the impairment recognized and the resulting value will be the assets new accounting basis 
in and  we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
broadcasting licenses our estimate of the value of broadcasting licenses uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance 
we determine the fair value of the broadcasting licenses in each of our markets by relying on a discounted cash flow approach a year income model assuming a start up scenario in which the only assets held by an investor are broadcasting licenses 
these variables include but are not limited to the discount rate used in the determination of fair value  the market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type  the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including assumptions regarding each market s population  household income  retail sales and other factors that would influence advertising expenditures  the estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  the listening audience covered by an average station s broadcast signal and its comparison to other media competition within the market area  an effective tax rate assumption  and future terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
we perform our broadcasting license impairment test by evaluating our broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
for purposes of testing impairment  indefinite lived intangible assets are combined into a single unit of accounting 
since the broadcasting licenses in each market are operated as a single asset  each market s broadcasting licenses are a single unit of accounting 
we completed our annual impairment test for broadcasting licenses during the second quarter of and determined that the fair value of the broadcasting licenses was in excess of the carrying value for each of our markets and  accordingly  no impairment was recorded 
the methodology we used in determining our key estimates and assumptions was applied consistently to each market 
as a result  the analysis for each market is the same 
of the seven variables identified above  we believe that the first three in clauses through above are the most important to the determination of fair value 
the following table reflects these estimates and assumptions used in as compared to the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test 
in general  when comparing the second quarter of to the second quarter of the discount rate  which was calculated using estimated required returns on debt and equity of publicly traded radio companies  did not change  the operating profit margin ranges expected for average stations in the same markets where we operate remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations in several markets  and the market long term revenue growth rate did not change 
estimates and assumptions second quarter second quarter discount rate operating profit margin ranges expected for average stations in the same markets where the company operates to to long term revenue growth rate range of the company s markets to to the discount rate to be used by a typical market participant reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows for the broadcast industry 
the same discount rate was used for each of our markets 
the discount rate is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity capital in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
operating profit is defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax and corporate allocation charges 
operating profit is then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and national representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margin 
operating profit margins are projected based upon industry operating profit norms  which reflect market size and station type 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our radio stations in a market  but is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 
if the outlook for the industry s growth declines  then operating profit margins would be negatively impacted  which would negatively impact the value of our broadcasting licenses 

table of contents to determine the radio broadcasting industry s future revenue growth rate  management uses publicly available information on industry expectations rather than management s own estimates  which could be different 
in addition  these long term market growth rate estimates could vary in each of our markets 
using the publicly available information on industry expectations  each market s revenues were forecasted over a ten year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rate for the radio broadcast industry  which was further adjusted for each of our markets 
if the industry s growth is less than forecasted  then the fair value of our broadcasting licenses could be negatively impacted 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our broadcasting licenses  however  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us  or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our broadcasting licenses below the amount reflected on the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize impairment charges  which could be material  in future periods 
the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our radio broadcasting licenses as of december  for units of accounting where the carrying value of the licenses is considered material to our financial statements geographical markets 
rather than presenting the percentage separately for each unit of accounting  management s opinion is that this table in summary form is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the recoverability of the broadcasting licenses 
in addition  the units of accounting are not disclosed with the specific market name as such disclosure could be competitively harmful to us 
units of accounting as of june  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value to greater than to greater than to greater than number of units of accounting carrying value in thousands broadcasting licenses valuation at risk as a result of the second quarter impairment test of our broadcasting licenses  there were ten units of accounting where the fair value exceeded their carrying value by or less as of june  in aggregate  these ten units of accounting at risk have a carrying value of million 
if overall market conditions or the performance of the economy deteriorates  advertising expenditures and radio industry results could be negatively impacted  including the expectations for future growth 
this could result in future impairment charges for these  or other of our units of accounting

we determined that a radio market is a reporting unit and  in total  we assessed goodwill at separate reporting units four of our reporting units have no goodwill recorded as of june  
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the amount reflected on the balance sheet  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to a reporting unit may be impaired  and we are required to perform a second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we compare the amount reflected on the balance sheet to the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
to determine the fair value  we use a market approach and  when appropriate  an income approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
in step one of our goodwill analysis  we considered the results of the market approach and the income approach in computing the fair value of our reporting units 
in the market approach  we applied an estimated market multiple of between seven and a half times and eight times to each reporting unit s operating performance to calculate the fair value 
this multiple was consistent with the multiple applied to all markets in the second quarter of management believes that these approaches are an appropriate measurement given the current market valuations of broadcast radio stations together with the historical market transactions  including those in recent months 
factors contributing to the determination of the reporting unit s operating performance were historical performance and management s estimates of future performance 
in the income approach  we used the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit the key estimates and assumptions are included in the table below 
the results of step one indicated that it was not necessary to perform the second step analysis in any of the markets tested 
as a result of the step one test  no impairment loss was recorded during the second quarter of we performed a reasonableness test by comparing the fair value results for goodwill by using the implied multiple based on our cash flow performance and our current stock price and comparing the results to prevailing radio broadcast transaction multiples 
the following table reflects certain key estimates and assumptions used in the second quarter of and in the second quarter of  the date of the most recent prior impairment test 
in general  when comparing the second quarter of to the second quarter of the discount rate  which was estimated using required returns on debt and equity of publicly traded radio companies  did not change  the market long term revenue growth rate did not change  and the estimated market multiples used in step one of the market valuation approach did not change

if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our credit facility would decrease by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest benefit or interest expense associated with the use of an outstanding derivative rate hedging instrument 
due to the impact of the debt refinancing  we expect that interest expense will be substantially higher in as of december   the following derivative rate hedging transaction to fix interest on our variable rate debt was outstanding 
this rate hedging transaction is tied to the one month libor interest rate 
type of hedge notional amount effective date collar fixed libor rate expiration date amounts in millions swap may  n a may  the net fair value based upon current market rates of the rate hedging transaction is included as a derivative instrument in short term liabilities  which is based upon the maturity date 
our rate hedging transaction is tied to the one month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the remaining period to maturity and the forward interest rate to maturity 
assuming the hedging transaction is a liability i any decrease in the remaining period to maturity and or an increase in the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  and ii any decrease in the forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
the fair value of our derivative instrument outstanding as of december  was a liability of million  which was a million decrease in the liability as compared to the balance as of december  this change was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in the remaining period to maturity of the derivative instrument as the forward interest rate to maturity remained relatively flat 

table of contents our credit exposure under our hedging agreements  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing such agreements in the event of nonperformance by our counterparty 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counterparties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the quantity of advertisers  the minimal reliance on any one advertiser  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertising business sectors
