item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor solutions in the growing broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our products include rf power amplifiers  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters  line amplifiers and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as fem s 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the high growth and convergence occurring in the voice  data and video segments of the broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our rf power amplifier products enable mobile handsets  datacards and other devices to access g and g wireless networks utilizing international standards including lte  wcdma  hspa  cdma  evdo and wimax 
our wifi products enable connectivity for wireless mobile devices and other computing devices 
our catv products enable fixed point  wireline broadband communications over catv infrastructure as well as cable modem and set top box products 
our wireless infrastructure products support operator commitments worldwide to optimize the increasing demands for subscriber data through deployment of new small cell base stations as part of a heterogeneous network 
our business strategy focuses on enabling anytime  anywhere connectivity which enhances the consumer s broadband and wireless experience 
we develop rf front end solutions for communications equipment manufacturers and we partner with industry leading wireless and wireline chipset providers who incorporate our solutions into their reference designs 
our solutions cost effectively enhance communications devices by improving rf performance  efficiency  reliability  time to market and integration while reducing the size  weight and cost of these products 
we leverage our technological knowledge and advantages to be a leading technology enabler via innovative semiconductor solutions for broadband wireless and wireline communications 
we believe our patented ingap plus technology  which combines bipolar amplifying structures phemt rf switches on the same die  coupled with our three level metal interconnect process provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
additionally  we believe proprietary designs of our help power amplifiers when combined with higher efficiency at high output power provide our customers a competitive advantage by delivering performance required for g and g devices with lower battery power consumption and longer use time than comparable products in these markets 
our six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since in addition  we have a strategic foundry agreement with win semiconductors of taiwan to supplement our existing wafer fabrication capability and allow for additional and flexible capacity without the requisite capital investment 
our annual revenues decreased in after increasing in from  as the company experienced a decline in wireless revenues resulting from a decline in revenue from one of our largest customers resulting from certain of their programs reaching end of life and their change in chipset suppliers that did not utilize our power amplifiers 
we anticipate a decline in total revenues in the first quarter of we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected over the long term to continue to result in competitive or declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies significant estimates we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
effect if actual results differ description judgments and uncertainties from assumptions revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when title to the products is transferred to the customer  which occurs upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the sales order 
we maintain revenue allowances for price protection and stock rotation for certain distributor sales 
these allowances are recorded upon shipment and calculated based on distributors indicated intent  historical data  current economic conditions and contractual terms 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for price protection and stock rotation 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on distributors indicated intent  historical data  current economic conditions and contractual terms 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to record revenue allowances for the years ended december   and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
the reserve is based on historical experience and an analysis of credit risk 
our allowance for doubtful accounts methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to apply judgment to evaluate credit risk and collectability of aged accounts receivables based on historical experience and forward looking assumptions 
we have not made any material changes in our accounting methodology used to create and maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended december   and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a review of forecasted short term demand in relation to on hand inventory  salability  general market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventory reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we have not made any material changes to our inventory reserve methodology for the years ended december   and we do not believe that significant changes will be made in future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these reserves 
however  if our estimates are inaccurate or technological changes affect consumer demand we may be exposed to unforeseen gains or losses 
a difference in our inventory reserves at december  would affect our consolidated financial statements for year then ended by approximately million 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining current and historical returns  current economic conditions and contractual terms to provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold 
our warranty reserve methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future product returns by customers 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements 
we have not made any material changes to our warranty reserve methodology for the years ended december   and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities available for sale securities are stated at fair value  as determined by quoted market prices or independent valuation models  which uses a combination of two calculations a discounted cash flow model and a market comparables method 
we review our investments on an ongoing basis for indications of possible impairment  and if an impairment is identified and considered other than temporary  it is recorded as a charge to income 
the primary factors we consider in classifying the timing of an impairment are the extent to which and period of time that the fair value of each investment has declined below its cost basis 
unrealized improvement gains in value subsequent to recording an impairment charge to income are reflected in other comprehensive income  whereas realized gains and losses are recorded through other income expense 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for accretion of market discounts over the effective life of the debt securities and recorded through interest income 
the valuations include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security  expected cash flows  discount rates  credit ratings  workout periods and overall capital market liquidity 
further  the determination of whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary requires significant judgment regarding the extent and timing of declines in value versus its cost basis 
while we have not made any material changes to our valuation methodology for the years ended december   and  capital market expectations  liquidity and rates have fluctuated in the periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that would have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan which includes non qualified stock options  share awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
see note of item for a discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of stock based compensation for our non qualified stock options and employee stock purchase plans at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant contains assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  risk free rate  the expected life and potential forfeitures of awards 
management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates stock based compensation expense accordingly 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future rates of volatility of our stock price  employee turnover and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and stock based compensation recognized by the company 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to calculate stock based compensation for the years ended december   and we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation expense 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets is primarily comprised of fixed assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate asset fair values  including estimating future cash flows  useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss for the years ended december   and as of december   we evaluated fixed assets for impairment and performed a recoverability analysis 
the results of the analysis indicate that the assets are fully recoverable 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may record material losses 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have not recorded a benefit or provision for income taxes other than for the refund of certain research and experimental tax credits during we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to measure our deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the years ended december   and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to record our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future taxable income  we may record material income tax benefits 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and impairment recovery charges operating loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit from income taxes net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in market demand for wcdma cellular device markets and in broadband from lower cable set top box and wimax applications demand 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s wireless products decreased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in sales was primarily the result of decreased demand in our wcdma cellular device markets due to declines at one of our largest customers due to certain products reaching end of life and their change in chipset providers that do not utilize our power amplifiers and a decline in the market penetration of datacard products for embedded wireless connectivity 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s broadband products decreased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased demand from cable set top box and wimax applications 
gross margin 
gross margin for decreased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower production and sales volume and a concentration of fixed costs as a percent of smaller revenues 
fixed production costs include  but are not limited to depreciation  maintenance and operations support functions 
research development 
company sponsored research and development r d expenses decreased during to million from million during the decrease resulted from improved controls over our key projects  lower labor costs and recruitment expense 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to management separation charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of totaling million 
restructuring and impairment recovery charges 
during the second quarter of  we implemented workforce reductions  which eliminated approximately positions  resulting in a restructuring charge of million for severance and related benefits 
during the second quarter of  we sold the wafer fabrication building in kunshan  china which had been fully written off in the sale resulted in a net recovery of million 
benefit from income taxes 
the housing and economic recovery act of included the partial refund of certain carried forward research and experimental r e tax credits 
during the third quarter of  the company finalized and filed its r e claim as part of its federal tax return and subsequently received cash of million 
such refund was recorded as a benefit from income taxes 
compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales increase resulted from an increase in market demand  particularly for wireless products 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s wireless products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand in wcdma and to a lesser degree cdma cellular device markets 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s broadband products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in sales was primarily due to increased demand for wimax and catv subscriber and infrastructure products  partly offset by declines in wifi pas shipped into the pc notebook market 
gross margin 
gross margin for increased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
gross margin for included charges of million  representing of revenue  arising from a settlement of a commercial dispute with a customer and certain inventory reserve charges 
after considering the charge outlined above  the remaining increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased product shipments and wafer production  and fixed production costs decreasing as a percent of higher revenues and was further supported by variable cost improvements gained over the prior year 
fixed production costs include  but are not limited to depreciation  maintenance and operations support functions 
research development 
company sponsored research and development r d expenses increased during to million from million during the increase was primarily due to greater material spending  personnel and support costs for our accelerated r d product and process development efforts 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was driven by increased investment in our sales effort  which was partly offset by reductions in general and administrative costs 
restructuring and impairment recovery charges 
during the second quarter of  we sold the wafer fabrication building in kunshan  china which had been fully written off in the sale resulted in a net recovery of million 
during the first quarter of we implemented workforce reductions  which eliminated approximately positions  resulting in a restructuring charge of million principally for severance and related benefits 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower average funds invested 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease principally related to the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in october other income expense  net 
other income expense primarily results from valuation activity in marketable securities we hold 
other income of million in compares to million of other expense in in  other income principally relates to recoveries on redemptions of certain action rate securities 
in  other expense was comprised of a million other than temporary decline in value on certain auction rate securities and a corporate debt security held by the company  offset by million of income recorded on par value redemption recoveries 
benefit from income taxes 
the housing and economic recovery act of included the partial refund of certain carried forward research and experimental r e tax credits 
during the third quarter of and  the company finalized and filed its r e claim as part of its and federal tax return and subsequently received cash of million in each of these periods 
such refund was recorded as a benefit from income taxes 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
operations used million in cash during  primarily as a result of our operating results adjusted for non cash expenses  as reduced by million of cash generated by reducing working capital 
investing activities used million of cash during  consisting of net purchases of marketable securities of million and net purchases of equipment of million  as reduced by million of proceeds on sale 
financing activities provided million of cash during  consisting of proceeds received from the employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
at december   the company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately million 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our equity 
subject to liquidity considerations of our auction rate securities as discussed more fully in item a  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms 
the table below summarizes required cash payments as of december contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations impact of recently issued accounting standards changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates to the fasb s accounting standards codification 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure requirements 
the guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value to ensure fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june and december  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income oci 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from oci to net income on the face of the financial statements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   with the exception of the requirement to present reclassification adjustments from oci to net income on the face of the financial statements  which has been deferred pending further deliberation by the fasb 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and available for sale securities are exposed to changes in short term interest rates 
our available for sale securities consist of fixed income securities  us government agency debt securities  a corporate bond security and certain auction rate securities  the latter of which are discussed more specifically below 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated interest rate by expected maturity value fair value s years total s principal weighted average stated interest rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have valued some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
we invest the majority of our cash in money market funds  fixed income securities and us government agency debt securities in order to protect principal  maintain liquidity as well as fund operations 
fluctuations in interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested by the company 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on our balance sheet at market value 
within our million in marketable securities at december   we held a total of million of fixed income securities  million of us government agency debt securities  million of auction rate securities ars  and million as a former auction corporate debt security originally purchased as an ars prior to its exchange for the underlying year notes due ars were a short term cash management instrument used by the market and the company prior to the instrument used a monthly dutch auction process to provide liquidity on long term financial instruments by resetting the applicable interest rate and through the reset  allowed existing investors to rollover or liquidate their holdings at par value 
during the second half of and the first quarter of  ars failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders and trading continues to be constrained 
the funds associated with the failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a suitable buyer is found outside of the auction process or an issuer redeems its security 
to date  we have not realized any losses on ars held by the company or the notes received in exchange for an ars  but have recognized other than temporary impairments of million 
the fair market values of certain of our ars  when combined with the fair market values of our corporate debt security have subsequently increased by million which was recorded to other comprehensive income 
we anticipate selling the existing and former auction corporate debt securities prior to a recovery in valuation 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments for impairment and for short term classification purposes 
we may not be able to access cash by selling the aforementioned debt or preferred securities without the loss of principal until a buyer is located  a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by their issuers or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity or in perpetuity for the preferred ars 
based on our ability to access our cash  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
