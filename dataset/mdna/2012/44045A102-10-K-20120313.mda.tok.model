item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this section  except where the context suggests otherwise  the terms we  us  our and horizon technology finance refer to horizon technology finance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for periods prior to october   the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes reflect the performance of our predecessor  compass horizon  and its wholly owned subsidiary  horizon credit i llc  both of which were formed in january and commenced operations in march amounts are stated in thousands  except shares and per share data and where otherwise noted 
overview we are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in development stage companies in the technology  life science  healthcare information and services and cleantech industries  which we refer to as our target industries 
our investment objective is to generate current income from the loans we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such loans 
we make secured loans  which we refer to as venture loans  to companies backed by established venture capital and private equity firms in our target industries  which we refer to as venture lending 
we also selectively lend to publicly traded companies in our target industries 
we are an externally managed  closed end  non diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with regulatory requirements  including limitations on our use of debt 
we are permitted to  and expect to  finance our investments through borrowings 
however  as a bdc  we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage  as defined in the act  equals at least after such borrowing 
the amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing

consolidated results of operations the consolidated results of operations set forth below include historical financial information of our predecessor  compass horizon  prior to our election to become a bdc and our election to be treated as a ric 
as a bdc and a ric for us federal income tax purposes  we are also subject to certain constraints on our operations  including limitations imposed by the act and the code 
also  the management fee that we pay to our advisor under the investment management agreement is determined by reference to a formula that differs materially from the management fee paid by compass horizon in prior periods 
for these and other reasons  the results of operations described below may not be indicative of the results we report in future periods 
consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and total investment income    total expenses    net investment income before excise tax   provision for excise tax net investment income    net realized gains  provision for excise tax net unrealized depreciation appreciation   credit provision for loan losses net income    average investments  at fair value   average debt outstanding    net income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons  including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as a result  annual comparisons of net income may not be meaningful 
investment income investment income increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   total investment income consisted primarily of million in interest income from investments  which included million in income from the amortization of discounts and origination fees on investments 
interest income on investments and other investment income increased primarily due to the increased average size of the loan portfolio 
fee income on investments was primarily comprised of a one time success fee received upon the completion of an acquisition of one of our portfolio companies and from prepayment fees collected from our portfolio companies 
investment income increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   total investment income consisted primarily of million in interest income from investments  which included million in income from the amortization of discounts and origination fees on investments 
interest income on investments and other investment income increased primarily due to the increased average size of the loan portfolio 
fee income was primarily comprised of loan prepayment fees collected from our portfolio companies 
for the years ended december   and  our dollar weighted average annualized yield on average loans was approximately  and  respectively 
investment income  consisting of interest income and fees on loans  can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large loans 
interest income from the five largest loans accounted for approximately  and of investment income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december  and  interest receivable was million and million  respectively  which represents one month of accrued interest income on substantially all our loans 
the increase in was due to a larger loan portfolio relative to expenses total expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total operating expenses for each period consisted principally of management fees  incentive and administrative fees  interest expense and  to a lesser degree  professional fees and general and administrative expenses 
interest expense  which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs  decreased in from primarily due to a lower effective interest rate in interest expense remained consistent in and primarily from a decreasing libor rate offset by a higher average outstanding debt balances on the westlb facility 
effective with the completion of our initial public offering in october  we pay management and incentive fees under the investment management agreement which provides a higher management fee base as compared to amounts previously paid by compass horizon 
base management fee expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the higher management fee base 
base management fee expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the average loan portfolio in from incentive fees for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  due to a full twelve months of expense in compared to only two months in the incentive fees for the year ended december  consisted of approximately million and million for part one and part two of the incentive fee  respectively 
there were no incentive fees prior to the ipo 
in connection with the administration agreement  which commenced upon our conversion to a bdc in  we incurred million of administrative fee for the year ended december  the administrative fee increased compared to due to a full twelve months of expense in compared to only two months in professional fees and general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increased cost of being a public company 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increased cost of being a public company 
excise tax was incurred in as we elected to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income 
at december   we accrued an excise tax of approximately million on approximately million of undistributed earnings from operations and capital gains that we intend to distribute in net realized gains and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  and includes investments charged off during the period  net of recoveries 
the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized 
during the year ended december   we recognized realized gains totaling approximately million primarily due to the sale of warrants of three portfolio companies 
we recognized realized gains of approximately million during the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of warrants of two portfolio companies 
we recognized realized gains of approximately million during the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of warrants of one portfolio company 
for the year ended december   net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled approximately million which was primarily due to million in reversal of unrealized appreciation on the sale of warrants and million of unrealized depreciation on six debt investments partially offset by unrealized appreciation on investments 
for the years ended december  and  the year to year increase is primarily due to the fair value appreciation on warrants 
credit or provision for loan losses for the period from january  through october   the credit for loan losses was million and for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million 
the credit arose from december  through october  primarily due to improved portfolio asset quality during across all credit ratings within the loan portfolio 
the loan portfolio had a weighted average credit rating of and as of october  and december   respectively 
see loan portfolio asset quality 
as of october   the date of our election to be treated as a bdc  we no longer record a credit or provision for loan losses 
we record each individual loan and investment on a quarterly basis at fair value 
changes in fair value are recorded through our statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had cash and investments in money market funds of million and million  respectively 
these amounts are available to fund new investments  reduce borrowings under the credit facilities  pay operating expenses and pay dividends 
our primary sources of capital have been from our ipo in october  use of our credit facilities and from a private placement of million of equity capital in march the westlb facility had a three year initial revolving term and on march  the revolving term ended 
the outstanding principal balance under the westlb facility of million as of december  is amortizing based on loan investment payments received through march  as of december   we had available borrowing capacity of approximately million under our wells facility  subject to existing terms and advance rates 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under the wells facility was million 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  and our financing activities used cash of million for the same period 
our operating activities used cash primarily for investing in portfolio companies 
such cash was provided primarily from proceeds from our ipo and draws under the credit facilities 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  and our financing activities provided net cash proceeds of million for the same period 
our operating activities used cash primarily for investing in portfolio companies 
such cash was provided primarily from proceeds from our ipo and draws under the westlb facility 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  and our financing activities provided net cash proceeds of million for the same period 
our operating activities used cash primarily for investing in portfolio companies that was provided primarily from our availability on our westlb facility 
our primary use of available funds is making investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
we expect to opportunistically raise additional equity and debt capital as needed  and subject to market conditions  to support our future growth through future equity offerings  issuances of senior securities and or future borrowings  to the extent permitted by the act 
in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our income except for certain net capital gains 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally will be required to meet a coverage ratio of 
this requirement will limit the amount that we may borrow 
current borrowings we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  credit i  entered into the westlb facility 
the base rate borrowings under the westlb facility bear interest at one month libor as of december  and as of december  plus 
the rates were and as of december  and  respectively 
we were able to request advances under the westlb facility through march  we may not request new advances and we must repay the outstanding advances under the westlb facility as of such date and at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the westlb facility  particularly the condition that the principal balance of the westlb facility does not exceed seventy five percent of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible loans to our portfolio companies 
all outstanding advances under the westlb facility are due and payable on march  the westlb facility is collateralized by all loans and warrants held by credit i and permits an advance rate of up to of eligible loans held by credit i 
the westlb facility contains covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum net worth and to restrict the loans securing the westlb facility to certain criteria for qualified loans  and includes portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement 
we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  credit ii entered into the wells facility on july  the interest rate is based upon the one month libor plus a spread of  with a libor floor of 
the interest rate was as of december  we may request advances under the wells facility through july  the revolving period 
after the revolving period  we may not request new advances and we must repay the outstanding advances under the wells facility as of such date  at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the wells facility 
all outstanding advances under the wells facility are due and payable on july  the wells facility is collateralized by loans held by credit ii and permits an advance rate of up to of eligible loans held by credit ii 
the wells facility contains covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum net worth  to restrict the loans securing the wells facility to certain criteria for qualified loans and to comply with portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement 
as of december  and  other assets were million and million  respectively  which is primarily made up of debt issuance cost and prepaid expenses 
the increase in was due to the debt issuance cost incurred related to the wells facility of approximately million 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of our significant contractual payment obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years borrowings    unfunded commitments    total    in the normal course of business  we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit  in the form of loans  to our portfolio companies 
unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet 
our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time 
as of december   we had unfunded commitments of approximately million 
these commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the balance sheet financial instruments that we hold 
since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
in addition to the wells facility and westlb facility  we have certain commitments pursuant to our investment management agreement entered into with our advisor 
we have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee 
payments under the investment management agreement are equal to a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average gross assets and a two part incentive fee 
we have also entered into a contract with our advisor to serve as our administrator 
payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our advisor s overhead in performing its obligation under the agreement  including rent  fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required under the code to distribute at least of our net ordinary income and net short term capital gains in excess of net long term capital losses  if any  to our stockholders on an annual basis 
additionally  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income on an annual basis and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously paid no us federal income tax to avoid a us federal excise tax 
we intend to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders as determined by our board 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the act 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including the possible loss of our qualification as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
thus  the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains 
stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a dividend payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains 
we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a distribution  then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan 
if a stockholder opts out  that stockholder will receive cash distributions 
although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to us federal  state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions  stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes 
critical accounting policies the discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value 
our board determines the fair value of its portfolio investments 
prior to our election to become a bdc  loan investments were stated at current unpaid principal balances adjusted for the allowance for loan losses  unearned income and any unamortized deferred fees or costs 
we apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with relevant gaap  which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements 
we have categorized our investments carried at fair value  based on the priority of the valuation technique  into a three level fair value hierarchy 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date 
the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether the product is new  whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions 
to the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
the three categories within the hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
income recognition interest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding 
interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments  the loan is placed on non accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued 
interest payments received on loans that are on non accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid 
we receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business  including advisory fees  commitment fees  amendment fees  non utilization fees and prepayment fees collectively  the fees 
in a limited number of cases  we may also receive a non refundable deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction 
loan origination fees  net of certain direct origination costs  are deferred  and along with unearned income  are amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan 
fees for counterparty loan commitments with multiple loans are allocated to each loan based upon each loan s relative fair value 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the loan is returned to accrual status 
certain loan agreements also require the borrower to make an end of term payment that is accrued into income over the life of the loan to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the borrower to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
in connection with substantially all lending arrangements  we receive warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower 
the warrants are recorded as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
the warrants are considered loan fees and are also recorded as unearned loan income on the grant date 
the unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the related loan in accordance with our income recognition policy 
subsequent to loan origination  the warrants are also measured at fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized gain or loss on warrants 
gains from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains on warrants 
allowance for loan losses prior to our election to become a bdc  the allowance for loan losses represented management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the estimation of the allowance was based on a variety of factors  including past loan loss experience  the current credit profile of our borrowers  adverse situations that had occurred that may affect individual borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of underlying collateral and general economic conditions 
the loan portfolio is comprised of large balance loans that are evaluated individually for impairment and are risk rated based upon a borrower s individual situation  current economic conditions  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the potential occurrence of a loss event and in measuring impairment 
the allowance for loan losses was sensitive to the risk rating assigned to each of the loans and to corresponding qualitative loss factors that we used to estimate the allowance 
those factors were applied to the outstanding loan balances in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
if necessary  based on performance factors related to specific loans  specific allowances for loan losses were established for individual impaired loans 
increases or decreases to the allowance for loan losses were charged or credited to current period earnings through the provision credit for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible were charged against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off loans increased the allowance for loan losses 
a loan was considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it was probable that we were unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment included payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experienced insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally were not classified as impaired 
management determined the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment was measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan was collateral dependent 
impaired loans also included loans modified in troubled debt restructurings where concessions had been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
in order to qualify as a ric  among other things  we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and we must timely distribute to our stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
we  among other things  have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders  which will generally relieve us from us federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  we will accrue excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned 
we evaluate tax positions taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold  or uncertain tax positions  would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year 
it is our policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense 
there were no material uncertain tax positions at december  and prior to our election to become a bdc  we were a limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and  as a result  all items of income and expense were passed through to  and are generally reportable on  the tax returns of the respective members of the limited liability company 
therefore  no federal or state income tax provision has been recorded for the period from january  to october  and the years ended december  and recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  asu 
asu converges the fair value measurement guidance in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  while other amendments change a particular principle in existing guidance 
in addition  asu requires additional fair value disclosures 
the amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  management is currently evaluating the effect that the provisions of asu will have on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the periods covered by our financial statements  the interest rates on the loans within our portfolio were mostly at fixed rates and we expect that our loans in the future will also have primarily fixed interest rates 
the initial commitments to lend to our portfolio companies are usually based on a floating libor index and typically have interest rates that are fixed at the time of the loan funding and remain fixed for the term of the loan 
assuming that the statement of assets and liabilities as of december  was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates may affect net income by more than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above 
our credit facilities have a floating interest rate provision based on a libor index which resets daily  and we expect that any other credit facilities into which we enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions 
we have used hedging instruments in the past to protect us against interest rate fluctuations and we may use them in the future 
such instruments may include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates 
because we currently fund  and will continue to fund  our investments with borrowings  our net income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income
