item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
adverse worldwide economic  geopolitical or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships  goodwill and other assets 
the demand for cruises is affected by international  national and local economic and geopolitical conditions 
the recent severe economic downturn coupled with continued uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape has had and continues to have an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary income and consumer confidence 
this  in turn  has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns  decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry as compared to more robust economic times 
although the cruise industry continued to recover in  recovery has been slow and has been hindered by the ongoing economic instability  including heightened concerns regarding european economies 
in addition  certain countries have been more severely impacted by the recent economic downturn than other economies around the world where we do business including  for example  spain where we operate our pullmantur brand 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether demand for cruises will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement 
stagnant or worsening global economic conditions could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns  depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 
demand for our cruises is also influenced by geopolitical events in the markets in which we operate 
unfavorable conditions  such as civil unrest and governmental changes  especially in regions with popular ports of call  can undermine consumer demand and or pricing for itineraries featuring these ports 
for example  the ongoing political instability in the eastern mediterranean and northern africa and its spillover effects in surrounding areas negatively impacted our results of operations in continued unrest and economic instability in this or other regions we do business could materially adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships  goodwill and other assets 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 
to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations  drawdowns under available credit facilities  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the recent severe economic downturn had an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations and if the current economic conditions worsen our operational cash flows could continue to be negatively affected 
see adverse worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents although we believe we have or can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations as expected  there can be no assurances to that effect 
our ability to timely refinance and or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms  our cost of funding and our ability to access additional funding  as may be needed  will depend upon numerous factors including but not limited to the vibrancy of the financial markets  our financial performance and credit ratings and the performance of our industry in general 
our inability to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities could adversely impact our liquidity 
our debt agreements contain covenants  including covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions and financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratios and limit our net debt to capital ratio 
our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions  industry conditions and other events  some of which may be beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to make draws under our revolving credit facilities is subject to the absence of material adverse changes in our business 
our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base 
more specifically  we may be required to prepay a majority of our debt facilities if i any person other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates and their respective affiliates the applicable group acquires ownership of more than of our common stock and the applicable group owns less of our common stock than such person or ii subject to certain exceptions  during any month period  a majority of the board is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of the board on the first day of such period 
certain of our outstanding debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by the acquisition of greater than of our common stock by a person other than a member of the applicable group coupled with a ratings downgrade 
our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities could result in an event of default 
generally  if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs  then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses  our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due and or terminated 
we cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings under any of the credit facilities or settle other outstanding contracts if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default 
in addition  under several of our agreements with credit card processors that accept credit cards for the sale of cruises and other services  the credit card processor may hold back a reserve from our credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events  including a default under our major credit facilities 
as of december   we were not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry  unusual weather conditions and other natural disasters or disruptions could affect our reputation as well as impact our sales and results of operations 
the operation of cruise ships  airplanes  land tours  port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents  illnesses  environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question guest safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction which could negatively impact our reputation 
incidents involving cruise ships  and  in particular the safety and security of guests and crew  such as the recent grounding of the costa concordia  media coverage thereof  as well as adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters or disruptions  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  and the collateral impact thereof could impact demand for our cruises 
the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by those incidents 
if any such incident occurs in a region during a time of high seasonal demand  the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year 
in addition  any events which impact the travel industry more generally may negatively impact our ability to deliver guests to our cruises and or interrupt our ability to obtain services and goods from key vendors in our supply chain 
any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance 
the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 
the recent severe economic downturn  including failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis  disrupted the capital and credit markets and additional economic concerns from some of the countries in the european 
table of contents union continue to strain the financial markets both in the us and internationally 
a recurrence of these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them 
this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices  interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements 
if any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations  results of operations and financial condition 
an increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and or pricing 
although our ships can be redeployed  cruise sales and or pricing may be impacted both by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace and by deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors 
a total of new ships with approximately  berths are on order for delivery through in the cruise industry 
the further growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders  without an increase in the cruise industry s share of the vacation market  could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement 
in addition  to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand  we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated 
any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships  goodwill and other assets 
if we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management strategy with our goal of satisfying guest expectations it may adversely impact our business success 
our goals are to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services 
there can be no assurances that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost containment efforts 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators  which provide other leisure options including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing  travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to guests 
our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation plc  which owns  among others  aida cruises  carnival cruise lines  costa cruises  cunard line  holland america line  iberocruceros  p o cruises and princess cruises  disney cruise line  msc cruises  norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
fears of terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
events such as terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the resulting political instability  travel restrictions  the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety  health and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had  and could have in the future  a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry 
as we continue to expand internationally  we become susceptible to a wider range of adverse events 
these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and  therefore  increase our shipboard employee costs 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 
we earn revenues  pay expenses  recognize assets and incur liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar  including  among others  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the australia dollar and the brazilian 
table of contents real 
in  we derived approximately of revenues from operations outside the united states 
because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  we must convert revenues  income and expenses  as well as assets and liabilities  into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period 
therefore  absent offsetting changes in other foreign currencies  increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our revenues  operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
however  there can be no assurances that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies  would not materially affect our financial results 
in addition  we have ship construction contracts which are denominated in euros 
while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts  we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged 
additionally  if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract  any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated 
termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 
environmental  labor  health and safety  financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies  such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels  increasing fuel efficiency requirements  further restricting emissions  or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our cost for fuel  cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
see item business regulation environmental regulations 
an increase in fuel prices not only impacts our fuel costs  but also some of our other expenses  such as crew travel  freight and commodity prices 
although not all initiatives are likely to be implemented  it is apparent that some future legislation and regulations related to the environment will impact the cruise industry and could adversely impact our costs 
some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
with regards to labor  we anticipate that the new standards set forth in the maritime labour convention when ratified and effective which we currently believe may occur in and  respectively will likely result in increased costs associated with our onboard employees 
see item business regulation labor regulations 
while we have been actively seeking ways to mitigate the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful or that our financial results of operations will not be materially impacted 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  treatment of disabled persons  health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests  security standards on board our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our guests 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world  especially in light of the recent grounding of the costa concordia 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks 
we operate our business globally and plan to continue to develop our international presence 
operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks  including unstable local economic conditions  volatile local political conditions  potential increases in duties and taxes  required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising  vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign based companies  currency fluctuations  interest rate movements  difficulties in operating under local business environments  us and global anti bribery laws or regulations  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
in addition  if a country where we have significant operations or obligations leaves the euro currency system  our financial condition may be adversely impacted 
if we are unable to address these risks adequately  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected  including potentially impairing the value of our ships  goodwill and other assets 

table of contents operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements 
in many parts of the world  including countries in which we operate  practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards 
we may not be successful in ensuring that our employees and other representatives stationed throughout the world properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations 
failure to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties  sanctions  damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 
while our historical focus has been to serve the north american cruise market  we have expanded our focus to increase our international guest sourcing  most recently  in the brazilian  asian and australian markets 
expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment 
there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets  and if we do not  we may be unable to recover our investment  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ship construction  repair or refurbishment delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on shipyards to construct  repair and refurbish our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order 
the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks 
delays or mechanical faults in ship construction or refurbishment have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships 
these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue  increased operating expenses  or both  and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
shipyards and their subcontractors may experience financial difficulties which could cause or result in delay  ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on shipyards to construct  repair and refurbish our vessels 
financial difficulties  liquidations or closures suffered by these shipyards and or their subcontractors may impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations 
delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations  as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 
our operating costs  especially fuel expenditures  could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 
expenditures for fuel represent a significant cost of operating our business 
if fuel prices rise significantly in a short period of time  we may be unable to increase fares or other fees sufficiently to offset fully our increased fuel costs 
we routinely hedge a portion of our future fuel requirements to protect against rising fuel costs 
however  there can be no assurance that our hedge contracts will provide a sufficient level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our hedge contracts  such as in the case of a counterparty s bankruptcy 
further volatility in fuel prices or disruptions in fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our other operating costs  including food  payroll  airfare for our shipboard personnel  taxes  insurance and security costs are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political conditions or other factors beyond our control 
increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors  local governmental regulations and local community 
table of contents concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 
price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 
many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark 
increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises 
in addition  changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our guests to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which  if realized  could adversely impact our business 
because we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships  we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive 
if we fail to offer competitive compensation packages  these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment  which could adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income 
significant disruptions  especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business  or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
a disruption in our shoreside operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations 
our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located at the port of miami  florida and we have call centers for reservations throughout the world 
although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans  actual or threatened natural disasters eg hurricanes  earthquakes  tornados  fires  floods or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity  reputation and results of operations 
in addition  substantial or repeated information systems failures  computer viruses  cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business 
we do not carry business interruption insurance for the majority of our shoreside operations or our information systems 
as such  any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
failure to develop the value of our brands and differentiate our products could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends on the strength and continued development of our cruise brands and on the effectiveness of our brand strategies 
failure to protect and differentiate our brands from competitors throughout the vacation market could adversely affect our results of operations 
the loss of key personnel  our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends  in large part  on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees  and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees 
we must continue to recruit  retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth 
furthermore  as of december   of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements 
a loss of key employees or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents business activities that involve our co investment with third parties may subject us to additional risks 
partnerships  joint ventures  and other business structures involving our co investment with third parties  such as our joint venture to operate tui cruises  generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks  including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations  or could have or develop business interests  policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours 
in addition  actions by another investor may present additional risks of operational difficulties 
a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position 
our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems 
these technologies and systems must be refined  updated  and or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis 
if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters  our business could suffer 
we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system  and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results 
a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code  or other jurisdictions  may have adverse effects on our income 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business and or from sources within the united states 
drinker biddle reath llp  our united states tax counsel  has delivered to us an opinion  based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it  to the effect that this income  to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships  is exempt from united states federal income tax pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 
the provisions of section are subject to change at any time by legislation 
moreover  changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity  residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders  trading volume or trading frequency of our shares  or relevant foreign tax laws of liberia or malta such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions  that could affect our eligibility for the section exemption 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future 
if we were not entitled to the benefit of section  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships  which would reduce our net income 
additionally  portions of our business are operated by companies that are within tonnage tax regimes of the uk and malta 
further  some of the operations of these companies are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation 
to the extent the tonnage tax laws of these countries change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked  we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions  resulting in lower net income 
as budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate  increases in income tax regulations or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed 
we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 
our corporate affairs are governed by our articles of incorporation and by laws and by the business corporation act of liberia 
the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes  there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia 
as such  the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions 
for example  the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts 
table of contents may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions 
there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments 
thus  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management  directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 
litigation  enforcement actions  fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and or damage our reputation 
our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions  fines  civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages 
in addition  improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines 
in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and or a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter 
such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us  prevent a change of control  and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the company without board approval which could result in the entrenchment of current management 
these include provisions in our articles of incorporation that prevent third parties  other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates  from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors
