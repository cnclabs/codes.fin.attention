item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk  uncertainties and other factors 
actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in part i  item a 
risk factors of this form k 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
we evaluate the estimates on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense for stock options  we perform an analysis of current market data and historical company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility  the expected term of the option  and the expected forfeiture rate 
with the exception of the expected forfeiture rate  which is not an input  we use these estimates as variables in the black scholes option pricing model 
depending upon the number of stock options granted  any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note equity compensation of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we evaluate our distributor arrangements  on a distributor by distributor basis  with respect to each of the four criteria above 
for a majority of our distributor arrangements  we provide rights of price protection and stock rotation 
as a result  revenue is deferred at the time of shipment to our domestic distributors and certain international distributors due to the determination that the ultimate sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable 
once the distributor has resold the product  and our final sales price is fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue for the final sales price and record the related costs of sales 
for certain of our smaller international distributors  we do not grant price protection rights and provide minimal stock rotation rights 
for these distributors  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the distributor  less an allowance for estimated returns  as the revenue recognition criteria have been met upon shipment 
further  the company defers the associated cost of goods sold on our consolidated balance sheet  net within the deferred income caption 
the company routinely evaluates the products held by our distributors for impairment to the extent such products may be returned by the distributor within these limited rights and such products would be considered excess or obsolete if included within our own inventory 
products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to the company 
we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company evaluates the ability to realize its deferred tax assets by using a three year forecast to determine the amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets that would be utilized if we achieved the results set page of forth in the three year forecast 
the company limited the forecast period to three years because of the cyclical and competitive nature of the semiconductor industry  and the company s reliance on a key customer who represented approximately percent of total sales in fiscal year there can be no assurance that we will achieve the results set forth in our three year forecast and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast 
we have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets basis by determining whether or not the anticipated future taxable income is expected to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized 
if our future income is not sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized  we increase the valuation allowance to the point at which all of the remaining recognized deferred tax assets will be utilized by the future taxable income 
if our anticipated future taxable income is sufficient to conclude that additional deferred tax assets should be recognized  we decrease the valuation allowance 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the receivable  our ongoing customer relations  as well as any disputes with the customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we may maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables from customers with whom we are involved in litigation 
see note accounts receivable  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand  management judgment  and the age of inventory 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets by testing for impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of these assets exceeds the fair value of the applicable assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note intangibles  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the total consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
there were no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years   or page of our available for sale investments  non marketable securities and other investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
marketable securities are evaluated for impairment if the decline in fair value below cost basis is significant and or has lasted for an extended period of time 
non marketable securities or other investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
for investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting  we evaluate information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and we weigh all quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
actual values could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note marketable securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies for various legal matters 
see note legal matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be made based on the status of the case  the results of the discovery process and other factors 
if we ultimately determine that an accrual should be made for a legal matter  this accrual could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position and the ultimate outcome may be materially different than our estimate

under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test and proceed as dictated in previous fasb guidance 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities  currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and the effect of market factors on the value of our marketable equity securities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses as of march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
these guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment  our downside exposure to interest rate risk is minimal 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduces our downside interest rate risk to the amount of interest income recognized in fiscal year  or million 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduces our downside interest rate risk to the amount of interest income recognized in fiscal year  or million 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduced our downside interest rate risk to an amount slightly less than the million calculation 
for all of these fiscal years  the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates were limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
the amounts disclosed in this paragraph are based on a basis point fluctuation in interest rates applied to the average cash balance for that fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in us dollars  however  in fiscal years   and  we entered into routine transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of our design  technical support  and sales offices outside of the us as of march  and march   a ten percent change in the value of the related currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts  we may  from time to time  have changes in exchange rates that can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products and the relative costs of operations based overseas
