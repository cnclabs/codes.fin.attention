real estate lending primarily includes both variable and adjustable rate products 
loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward immediately based on changes in the loan s index  normally prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
rates on adjustable rate loans move upward or downward after an initial fixed term of normally one  three  or five years 
rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans are made annually after the initial fixed term expires and are indexed mainly to shorter term treasury indexes 
generally  variable and adjustable rate loans contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases over the life of the loan of up to basis points and lifetime floors of basis points 
in addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments  loans secured by residential real estate typically contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of basis points

other commercial loans are asset based loans secured by equipment and lines of credit secured by receivables and include lending across a diverse range of business types 
commercial lending and real estate construction lending  including commercial leasing  generally includes a higher degree of credit risk than other loans  such as residential mortgage loans 
commercial loans  like other loans  are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements 
collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower s financial strength  the terms and amount of the loan  and collateral available to secure the loan 
credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower 
credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan s outstanding balance 
for construction loans  inaccurate initial estimates of a project s costs and the property s completed value could weaken the company s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property

the chief credit officer reviews all loans to insiders for adherence to underwriting standards and regulatory compliance as well as credits identified as substandard 
procedures the lending policy lists the products and credit services offered by each of the company s subsidiary banks 
each product and service has an established written procedure to adhere to when transacting business with a customer 
the lending policy also establishes pre determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience 
further  the policy establishes committees to review and approve or deny credit requests at various lending amounts 
this includes subcommittees of the bank boards of directors and  at certain lending levels  the entire bank board 
generally  for loans in excess of million  the subsidiaries bank s full board of directors will be presented with the loan request 
this only occurs when the potential credit has first been recommended by the loan officer and chief credit officer of the subsidiary bank  and then by the directors loan committee and the chief credit officer 
when loan requests are within policy guidelines and the amount requested is within their lending authority  lenders are permitted to approve and close the transaction 
a review of the loan file and documentation takes place within days to ensure policy and procedures are being followed 
approval authorities are under regular review for adjustment by affiliate management and the parent company

appraisals the value of real estate in the company s markets has generally declined as a result of the economic downturn that accelerated in net charge offs have been negatively impacted by slower sales and excess inventory related to loans secured by real estate developments 
the slower sales and excess inventory has decreased the cash flow and financial prospects of many borrowers  particularly those in the real estate development and related industries  and reduced the estimated fair value of the collateral securing these loans 
the company uses independent third party state certified or licensed appraisers 
these appraisers take into account local market conditions when preparing their estimate of fair value 
the company evaluates appraisals it receives from independent third parties subsequent to the appraisal date by monitoring transactions in its markets and comparing them to its projects that are similar in nature 
the company s internal audit department reviews appraisals on a test basis to determine that assumptions used in appraisals remain valid and are not stale 
new appraisals are obtained if market conditions significantly impact collateral values for those loans that are identified as impaired 
internal audit reviews appraisals related to all of the company s impaired loans and repossessed properties at least annually 
the company considers appraisals it receives on one property as a means to extrapolate the estimated value for other collateral of similar characteristics if that property may not otherwise have a need for an appraisal 
should a borrower s financial condition continue to deteriorate  an updated appraisal on that specific collateral will be obtained 
appraisals obtained for construction and development lending purposes are performed by state licensed or state certified appraisers who are credentialed and on the company s approved list 
plans and specifications are provided to the appraiser by bank personnel not directly involved in the credit approval process 
the appraisals conform to the standards of appraisal practices established by the appraisal standards board in effect at the time of the appraisal 
this includes net present value accounting for construction and development loans on an as completed and as is basis 
appraisal reviews are conducted internally by bank personnel familiar with the local market and who are not directly involved in the credit approval process and externally by state licensed and certified appraisers 
bank personnel do not increase the valuation from the appraisal but may  in some instances  make a reduction 
upon completion  a follow up site visit by the appraiser is completed to verify the property was improved per the original plans and specifications and recertify  if appropriate  the original estimate of as completed market value 
there are two circumstances where management may make adjustments to appraisals as discussed above  construction and development appraisals are on an as completed basis 
if work remains to be completed on a financed project  management will reduce the estimated value in the appraisal by the cost estimated to complete the work and  if required by the loan balance  establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan based on the need to complete such work 
if an appraisal for given collateral is still valid eg less than one year old  etc  but due to market conditions and the bank s familiarity with comparable property sales in the market the appraised value appears high  management may adjust downward from the last appraisal its estimate of the value of the collateral and  in turn  establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan to reflect this downward adjustment 
loan to value ratios are typically well under at inception  which gives the company a cushion as collateral values fall 
however  when updated appraisals reveal collateral exposure ie the value of the collateral for a nonperforming loan is less than originally estimated and no longer supports the outstanding loan amount  negotiations ensue with the borrower aimed at providing additional collateral support for the credit 
this may be in many forms as determined by the financial holdings of the borrower 
if not available  third party support for the credit is pursued eg  guarantors  equity investors 
if negotiations fail to provide additional adequate collateral support  reserves are allocated to the loan or the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated costs to sell 
when a construction loan or development loan is downgraded  a new appraisal is ordered contemporaneously with the downgrade 
the appraisers are instructed to give a fair value based upon both an as is basis and an as completed basis 
the twofold purpose is to facilitate management s decision making process in determining the cost benefits of completing a project compared with marketing the project as is 
the carrying value of a downgraded loan or non performing asset wherein the underlying collateral is an incomplete project is based on a fresh appraisal at the as is value 
the current appraisal is a compilation of the most recent sales available and therefore includes the risk premium established by the market conditions 
when the comparable sales are not deemed to be reliable or the adjustments are not satisfactory  management will make appropriate adjustments to the fair value which includes a risk premium discount deducted using the discounted cash flow framework 
the reserve or write down is expended upon completion of the appraisal and other relevant information assessment 
interest reserves interest reserves represent funds loaned to a borrower for the payment of interest during the development phase on certain construction and development loans 
interest reserves were a common industry practice when banks were more actively lending in their markets and the predictability of a sale or stabilization of the project had a high probability 
the interest reserve is a component of the loan proceeds which is determined at the loan s inception after a full evaluation of the sources and uses of funds for the project  and is intended to match the project s debt service requirements with its expected cash flows 
in all construction lending projects  the company monitors the project to determine if it is being completed as planned and if sales stabilization projections are being met 
since the real estate market has diminished over time  the company has been less active in construction and development lending and the use of the interest reserves 
for present and future construction and development loan requests  borrowers must show sufficient cash reserves and significant excess cash flow from all sources in addition to other underwriting criteria measures 
the projects viability is a major consideration as well  along with the probability of its stabilization and or sale 
due to the general lack of opportunities currently in our markets combined with our low desire for this segment of the lending portfolio  interest reserves are not commonplace 
supervision and regulation the company and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of their operations 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of depositors  borrowers  and federal deposit insurance funds  and  to a lesser extent  for the protection of stockholders and creditors 
changes in applicable laws  regulations  or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business 
the following summarizes certain of the more important aspects of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions 
supervisory authorities the company is a bank holding company  registered with and regulated by the federal reserve 
all four of its subsidiary banks are kentucky state chartered banks 
two of the company s subsidiary banks are members of their regional federal reserve bank 
the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions kdfi 
the regulatory authorities routinely examine the company and its subsidiary banks to monitor their compliance with laws and regulations  financial condition  adequacy of capital and reserves  quality and documentation of loans  payment of dividends  adequacy of systems and controls  credit underwriting and asset liability management  and the establishment of branches 
the company and its subsidiary banks are required to file regular reports with the frb  the fdic and the kdfi  as applicable 
capital the frb  the fdic  and the kdfi require the company and its subsidiary banks to meet certain ratios of capital to assets in order to conduct their activities 
to be well capitalized  the institutions must generally maintain a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of or more 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity and related surplus  retained earnings  and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill net of certain deferred tax liabilities and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and a limited amount of other items 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are generally weighted for risk 
certain assets  such as cash and us government securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as commercial and consumer loans  have a risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  average quarterly assets as defined are used and are not risk weighted 
if the institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a series of restrictions that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company  if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result 
undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval  which must be guaranteed by the institution s parent holding company 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision issued final rules related to global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity commonly referred to as basel iii previously agreed on by the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee 
the new rules present details of the basel iii framework  which includes increased capital requirements and limits the types of instruments that can be included in tier capital 
basel iii includes the following provisions i that the minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets be increased to from the current level of  to be fully phased in by january   and ii that the minimum requirement for the tier risk based capital ratio will be increased from to  to be fully phased in by january  the new minimums will be phased in starting january  basel iii also includes a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to maintain an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets in addition to the minimum requirement 
this requirement will be phased in between january  and january  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and  while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress  if a bank s regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement  the bank will be subject to more stringent constraints on dividends and bonuses 
in addition  basel iii includes a countercyclical buffer of up to  which could be imposed by countries to address economies that appear to be building excessive system wide risks due to rapid growth 
to constrain the build up of excess leverage in the banking system  basel iii introduces a new non risk based leverage ratio 
a minimum tier leverage ratio of will be tested during a parallel run period between january  and january  based on the results of the parallel run period  any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of regulatory agencies in the u 
s 
have yet to adopt rules for implementing basel iii 
however  the impact from basel iii is not expected to have a material impact on the company s level of capital since current levels are in excess of the requirements included in the framework 
basel iii includes two separate standards for supervising liquidity risks which include i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that banks have a sufficient amount of high quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress scenario over a day period  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon 
the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on january  the revised net stable funding ratio will become effective january  basel iii implementation in the us requires that further regulations and guidelines be issued by us banking regulators  which may significantly differ from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
expansion and activity limitations with prior regulatory approval  the company may acquire other banks or bank holding companies and its subsidiaries may merge with other banks 
acquisitions of banks located in other states may be subject to certain deposit percentage  age or other restrictions 
during the third quarter of  the company withdrew its financial holding company election upon the sale of its khl subsidiary 
financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to engage in expanded activities such as insurance underwriting  securities underwriting and distribution  travel agency activities  broad insurance agency activities  merchant banking  and other nonbanking activities that the frb determines to be financial in nature or complementary to these activities 
the frb normally requires some form of notice or application to engage in or acquire companies engaged in such activities 
under the bank holding company act  the company is generally prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in activities that are deemed not closely related to banking 
limitations on acquisitions of bank holding companies in general  other companies seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company such as the company would require the approval of the frb under the bank holding company act 
in addition  individuals or groups of individuals seeking to acquire control of a bank holding company such as the company would need to file a prior notice with the frb which the frb may disapprove under certain circumstances under the change in bank control act 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company 
control may exist under the change in bank control act if the individual or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company and no shareholder holds a larger percentage of the subject class of voting securities 
deposit insurance each of the company s subsidiary banks are members of the fdic  and their deposits are insured by the fdic s deposit insurance fund dif up to the amount permitted by law 
the company s subsidiary banks are thus subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
in february  the fdic adopted a long term dif restoration plan as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increased base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from its then current 
to its statutorily mandated minimum of within eight years as amended 
beginning april  the fdic established a bank s initial base assessment rate ranging between and basis points  depending on the banks risk category 
the initial base assessment rate was then adjusted higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
adjustments to the initial base assessment rate were based on a bank s level of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate ranged between and basis points and applied to a bank s assessable deposits when computing the fdic insurance assessment amount 
the fdic adopted an emergency special assessment in which superseded its interim rule that would have imposed a basis point assessment with an option for an additional basis point assessment 
under the final rule adopted  the fdic imposed a special assessment of basis points on a bank s total assets minus tier capital as of june  and collected september  the company paid million related to the special assessment 
the final rule also authorized the fdic to impose up to two additional basis points assessments if needed while capping each assessment at basis points of the banks assessment base 
in addition to the fdic s special assessment for  the fdic in november approved a final rule requiring banks to prepay their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of as well as all of   and on december  the prepayment was adopted by the fdic in lieu of an additional special assessment as summarized in the preceding paragraph 
the assessment rate used for all periods covered in the prepayment plan was the bank s assessment rate in effect as of september   increased by basis points for all of and the prepayment was based on a bank s regular assessment base total domestic deposits as of september   with a quarterly increase of an estimated annual growth rate through the end of the prepaid assessment is applied against actual future quarterly assessments until exhausted 
any funds remaining after june  will be returned to the institution 
requiring this prepaid assessment does not limit the fdic from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk based assessment system 
the company paid million on december  related to this assessment 
prepaid fdic insurance assessments were million on december  and included in other assets on the company s balance sheet 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act required changes to a number of components of the fdic insurance assessment that was effective april  the dodd frank act required the fdic to adopt a new dif restoration plan to ensure that the reserve ratio increases to from of insured deposits by under the restoration plan  the fdic dropped the uniform three basis point increase in initial assessment rates scheduled to take place on january  and adopted new regulations that redefined the assessment base as average consolidated assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period 
since the new assessment base resulted in a larger overall base when compared to the domestic deposits base methodology  overall assessments rates have been lowered and the secured liability adjustment has been eliminated from the rate calculation in an attempt to make the new assessments revenue neutral 
the new regulations retain the risk category system for depository institutions with less than billion in assets 
under this system  each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based upon the institution s capital and supervisory evaluation 
at least semi annually  the fdic will update its loss and income projections for the dif and  if needed  increase or decrease assessment rates 
in establishing assessments  the fdic is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion 
in addition to deposit insurance assessments  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership government corporation established by the competitive equality banking act of possessing assessment powers in addition to the fdic 
the fdic acts as a collection agent for fico  whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct federal savings loan insurance corporation 
fico assessment rates are determined quarterly and will continue until the fico bonds mature in during the fourth quarter of  the fdic issued a final rule implementing provisions of the dodd frank act that provide for temporary unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts  which became effective on december  and terminates on december  the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount available for depositors from thousand to thousand 
this coverage is in addition to  and separate from  the temporary unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
other statutes and regulations the company and its subsidiary banks are subject to numerous other statutes and regulations affecting their activities 
some of the more important are anti money laundering 
financial institutions are required to establish anti money laundering programs that must include the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the performance of the programs 
the company and its subsidiary banks are also subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships in order to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions 
recent laws provide the law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
the company s subsidiary banks are limited in their ability to lend funds or engage in transactions with the company or other nonbank affiliates of the company  and all transactions must be on an arms length basis and on terms at least as favorable to the subsidiary bank as prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies 
dividends 
the parent company s principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders  is the dividends that it receives from its subsidiary banks 
statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the subsidiary banks payments of dividends to the parent company as well as to the parent company s payment of dividends to its shareholders 
a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies may prevent the payment of a dividend if they determine that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
moreover  the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
the parent company and certain of its bank subsidiaries are currently under regulatory orders that restrict the payment of dividends 
for further information please refer to the caption recent regulatory events and increased capital requirements below

emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
eesa was signed into law on october  as a measure to stabilize and provide liquidity to the us financial markets 
under eesa  the troubled asset relief program tarp was created 
tarp granted the treasury authority to  among other things  invest in financial institutions and purchase troubled assets in an aggregate amount up to billion 
in connection with tarp  the cpp was launched on october  under the cpp  the treasury announced a plan to use up to billion of tarp funds to purchase equity stakes in certain eligible financial institutions  including the company

as conditions relating to cpp evolve  treasury may issue additional regulations as permitted under the program 
as required by the cpp  the company also issued a warrant to the treasury to purchase common shares equal to of the value of the preferred stock  with the number of warrants and exercise price determined based on the day average closing price of the common shares ending on the day prior to preliminary approval 
the warrants allow the us treasury to purchase  shares of company common stock at an exercise price of per share 
both the preferred shares and warrants are accounted for as additions to the company s regulatory capital 
temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the tlgp consists of two separate programs implemented by the fdic in october this includes the debt guarantee program dgp and the transaction account guarantee program tagp 
these programs were initially provided at no cost to participants during the first days 
eligible institutions that do not opt out of either of these programs become participants by default and will incur the fees assessed for taking part 
under the dgp  as amended  eligible participating entities were permitted to issue senior unsecured debt guaranteed by the fdic through october  the guarantee by the fdic would expire on the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december  during october the fdic adopted final rules to phase out the dgp 
the dgp expired october   however  the fdic established a six month emergency guarantee facility effective upon the expiration of the dgp 
subject to its prior approval  the fdic will provide guarantees of senior debt issued after october  through april  with the guarantee expiring on the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december  the company chose to opt out of the dgp 
under the tagp  the fdic guarantees of certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts up to any amount to participating fdic insured institutions 
the unlimited coverage  set to initially expire on december   was extended by the fdic in august with an expiration date of june  in april  the fdic further extended the tagp to december  and adopted rules that allowed extending the program an additional twelve months without further rulemaking 
however  amendments related to the enactment of the dodd frank act now provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts beginning december  for an additional two year period 
no opt out option is permitted and there is no separate assessment applicable to the covered accounts

dodd frank act 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law by president obama 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes to the regulation of the financial services industry  including provisions that centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws  apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies  require the federal banking regulators to seek to make their capital requirements countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction  change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance  make permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions  repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  increase the authority of the federal reserve to examine non bank subsidiaries  and codify and expand the source of strength doctrine as a statutory requirement 
the source of strength doctrine represents the long held policy view by the federal reserve that a bank holding company should serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks 
the parent company  under this requirement  is expected to commit resources to support a distressed subsidiary bank 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to further rulemaking which will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on commercial demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate

recent regulatory events and increased capital requirements the company s subsidiary banks are subject to capital based regulatory requirements 
the company has historically managed its banks capital levels with the goal of meeting the criteria established by its regulators for each bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized 
historically  to be well capitalized  a depository institution needed to have a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as of december   each of the company s four subsidiary banks satisfied these capital ratios 
although each of the company s subsidiary banks met the definition of well capitalized as of december   some of their capital levels have decreased in recent years as a result of the economic downturn that began in late because of the turmoil in the banking markets and continued difficulty many banks are experiencing with their loan portfolios  bank regulatory agencies are increasingly requiring banks to maintain higher capital reserves as a cushion for dealing with any further deterioration in their loan portfolios in order to maintain well capitalized status 
primarily as a result of examinations that took place starting in  the company s banking regulators have required higher minimum capital ratios that have resulted in capital infusions at certain of the company s banking subsidiaries 
the capital requirements and other supervisory actions resulting from the regulatory examinations are summarized below 
for a more complete discussion  please refer to the section captioned capital resources under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations part of this form k 
parent company 
primarily due to the regulatory actions and capital requirements at three of the company s subsidiary banks as discussed below  the frb st 
louis and kdfi proposed the company enter into a memorandum of understanding memorandum 
the company s board approved entry into the memorandum at a regular board meeting during the fourth quarter of pursuant to the memorandum  the company agreed that it would develop an acceptable capital plan to ensure that the consolidated organization remains well capitalized and each of its subsidiary banks meet the capital requirements imposed by their regulator as summarized below 
the company also agreed to reduce its common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of from 
per share down to 
per share and not make interest payments on the company s trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without prior approval from frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
other components in the regulatory order for the parent company include requesting and receiving regulatory approval for the payment of new salaries bonuses or other compensation to insiders  assisting its subsidiary banks in addressing weaknesses identified in their reports of examinations  providing periodic reports detailing how it will meet its debt service obligations  and providing progress reports with its compliance with the regulatory memorandum 
farmers bank 
in november of  the kdfi and frb st 
louis entered into a memorandum with farmers bank

at june   farmers bank had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
subsequent to june   the parent company injected into farmers bank an additional thousand in capital in order to raise its tier leverage ratio to to comply with the memorandum 
at december   farmers bank had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of other parts of the regulatory order include the development and documentation of plans for reducing problem loans  providing progress reports on compliance with the memorandum  developing and implementing a written profit plan and strategic plans  and evaluating policies and procedures for monitoring construction loans and use of interest reserves 
it also restricts the bank from extending additional credit to borrowers with credits classified as substandard  doubtful or special mention in the report of examination 
united bank 
in november of  the fdic and united bank entered into a cease and desist order c d primarily as a result of its level of nonperforming assets 
the c d was terminated in december coincident with the issuance of a consent order consent order entered into between the parties 
the consent order is substantially the same as the c d  with the primary exception being that united bank must achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of no later than march  at december   united bank had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
based on current estimates  the parent company has adequate cash levels as of december  to inject additional capital into united bank  if determined necessary  for it to meet the higher minimum tier leverage ratio requirement at march  the parent company has injected from its reserves million of capital into united bank since other components in the regulatory order include stricter oversight and reporting to its regulators in terms of complying with the order 
it also includes an increase in the level of reporting by management to its board of directors of its financial results  budgeting  and liquidity analysis  as well as restricting the bank from extending additional credit to borrowers with credits classified as substandard  doubtful or special mention in the report of examination 
there is also a requirement to develop a written contingency plan if the bank is unable to meet the capital levels established in the consent order 
citizens northern 
the kdfi and the fdic entered into a memorandum with citizens northern on september  the memorandum requires that citizens northern obtain written consent prior to declaring or paying a dividend and to increase tier leverage ratio to equal or exceed prior to september  and to achieve and maintain tier leverage ratio to equal or exceed prior to december  in december  the parent company injected thousand of capital into citizens northern to bring its tier leverage ratio up to as of year end at december   citizens northern had a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
other parts of the regulatory order include the development and documentation of plans for reducing problem loans  providing progress reports on compliance with the memorandum  and for the development and implementation of a written profit plan and strategic plans 
it also restricts the bank from extending additional credit to borrowers with credits classified as substandard  doubtful or special mention in the report of examination 
regulators continue to monitor the company s progress and compliance with the regulatory agreements through periodic on site examinations  regular communications  and quarterly data analysis 
at the parent company and at each of its bank subsidiaries  the company believes it is adequately addressing all issues of the regulatory agreements to which it is subject 
however  only the respective regulatory agencies can determine if compliance with the applicable regulatory agreements have been met 
the company and its subsidiary banks are in compliance with the requirements identified in the regulatory agreements as of december  the parent company maintains cash available to fund a certain amount of additional injections of capital to its bank subsidiaries as determined by management or if required by its regulators 
if needed  further amounts in excess of available cash may be funded by future public or private sales of securities  although the parent company is under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
competition the company and its subsidiaries face vigorous competition for banking services from various types of businesses other than commercial banks and savings and loan associations 
these include  but are not limited to  credit unions  mortgage lenders  finance companies  insurance companies  stock and bond brokers  financial planning firms  and department stores which compete for one or more lines of banking business 
the company also competes for commercial and retail business not only with banks in central and northern kentucky  but with banking organizations from ohio  indiana  tennessee  pennsylvania  and north carolina which have banking subsidiaries located in kentucky 
these competing businesses may possess greater resources and offer a greater number of branch locations  higher lending limits  and may offer other services not provided by the company 
in addition  the company s competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to the company and its subsidiary banks 
the company has attempted to offset some of the advantages of its competitors by arranging participations with other banks for loans above its legal lending limits  expanding into additional markets and product lines  and entering into third party arrangements to better compete for its targeted customer base 
competition from other providers of financial services may reduce or limit the company s profitability and market share 
the company competes primarily on the basis of quality of services  interest rates and fees charged on loans  and the rates of interest paid on deposit funds 
the business of the company is not dependent upon any one customer or on a few customers  and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the company

the exercise of regulatory authority generally may have a negative impact on the company s operations  which may be material on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company presently is subject to  and in the future may become subject to  additional supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on its business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of its common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  the kdfi for state chartered banks  the federal reserve for bank holding companies and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits  have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on the company s part if they determine that the company has insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices 
under this authority  bank regulators can require the company to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which the company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 
primarily as a result of increased levels of nonperforming assets  the parent company  farmers bank  united bank  and citizens northern have entered into separate agreements with their respective regulators 
in the aggregate  these agreements  among other things  require the company to develop an acceptable capital plan to ensure that the consolidated organization remains well capitalized and each of its subsidiary banks meet the capital requirements imposed by their regulator as described elsewhere in this report  the maintenance of minimum regulatory capital ratios at these three banks  these three banks refrain from paying dividends to the parent company unless approved in advance by the regulators and the company not make future interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without seeking prior approval from frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position and earnings trends  yield the conclusion that the payment of a common stock dividend is warranted 
if the company is unable to comply with the terms of its current regulatory orders  or is unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory orders to which it may become subject  then it could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including cease and desist orders  prompt corrective actions and or other regulatory enforcement actions 
if the company s regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
if one or more of the company s banks were unable to comply with regulatory requirements  such banks could ultimately face failure 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
our nonperforming assets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and take significant management time to resolve 
as of december   nonperforming loans which include performing restructured loans of million totaled million or of the company s loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets which include foreclosed real estate were million or of total assets at year end in addition  loans past due days and still accruing were million as of december  nonperforming assets adversely affect the company s net income in various ways 
the company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting interest income 
when the company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  it is required to mark the property to its fair value less estimated selling costs  which decreases earnings 
nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital the company s regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks 
while the company seeks to reduce its problem loans through workouts  restructurings and otherwise  decreases in the value of these assets  the underlying collateral or our borrowers performance or financial conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management of our banks  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future 
if economic conditions do not improve or worsen in our markets  the company could continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming assets 
losses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance established for that purpose  which will have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
volatility and deterioration in the broader economy increases the company s risk of credit losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
if a significant number of loans in the company s portfolio are not repaid  it would have an adverse effect on its earnings and overall financial condition 
like all banks  the company s subsidiaries maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management of each subsidiary s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in their loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
this evaluation is primarily based upon a review of the bank s and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  known risks contained in the bank s loan portfolio  composition and growth of the bank s loan portfolio and economic factors 
additionally  a bank s regulators may require additional provision for the loan portfolio in connection with regulatory examinations  agreements or orders 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
as a result  the company s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to cover actual losses in its loan portfolio 
consequently  the company risks having additional future provisions for loan losses that may continue to adversely affect its earnings 
if the company s local markets experience a prolonged recession or economic downturn  it may be required to make further increases in its allowance for loan losses and to charge off additional loans  which would adversely affect its results of operations and capital 
substantially all of the company s loans are to businesses and individuals located in kentucky 
a continuing or prolonged decline in the economy of central and northern kentucky could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
during  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million  which includes million for the fourth quarter  and recorded net loan charge offs of million  million of which was in the fourth quarter 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of million and net loan charge offs of million for  and a million provision and million of net loan charge offs which were recorded for the fourth quarter of generally  the company s nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers  however  more recently the prolonged decline in the general economy has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of delinquencies and nonperforming loans 
sluggish sales and excess inventory in the residential housing market has been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures for residential construction and land development loans 
as of december   the company s total nonperforming loans had decreased to million or of loans compared to million or of loans at december  if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  the company expects that it will continue to experience high delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  the company expects that a prolonged recession or economic downturn could severely impact economic conditions in its market areas and that it could experience high levels of delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  the company may be required to make further increases to its provision for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
if such additional provisions and charge offs cause the company to experience losses  it may be required to contribute additional capital to its bank subsidiaries to maintain capital ratios required by regulators 
the company s exposure to credit risk is increased by its real estate development lending 
real estate development loans represent of the company s impaired loans 
substantially all of the company s million nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  are secured by real estate 
development lending has historically been considered to be higher credit risk than single family residential lending 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers 
such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy in general because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends on successful development and  in most cases  sale of their property 
these loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortized over the loan period  but have a balloon payment due at maturity of the loan 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property 
in the current economic environment  the ability of borrowers to refinance or sell newly developed property or vacant land has greatly diminished 
if the real estate markets were to worsen or not improve  the company would likely experience increased credit losses and require additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses  which would adversely impact the company s earnings and financial condition 
the company s investment securities portfolio is comparatively larger than other community banks and it is more dependent on its investment portfolio to generate net income 
unlike many other community banks  the company relies more heavily on its investment securities portfolio as a source of interest income because it has a comparatively small loan portfolio 
if the company is not able to successfully manage the interest rate spread on the investment portfolio  its net interest income will decrease  which would adversely affect its results of operations and negatively impact net income 
investment securities tend to have a lower risk than loans  and as such  generally provide a lower yield 
for  average investment securities made up of the company s average total assets 
interest income on investment securities accounted for of total interest income for during the company sold and realized net gains on investment securities 
the company may not have the same level of net gains and may have net realized losses in future periods on the sale of investment securities  which would reduce earnings 
moreover  due to the current interest rate environment  proceeds from recent sales may be reinvested in investment securities with lower yields which may reduce earnings from investment securities 
the company continually monitors its investment securities portfolio for deteriorating values and for other than temporary impairments 
any material other than temporary impairments would likewise have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and could lead to additional losses 
the company cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economy on its future results of operations or the market price of its stock 
the national economy and the financial services sector in particular continue to face unique challenges 
the company cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted its performance and the markets it serves 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in the company s local markets would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects  and could also cause the market price of the company s stock to decline 
while it is impossible to predict how long these conditions may exist  the economic downturn could continue to present risks for some time for our industry and the company 
interest rate volatility could significantly harm the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  the policies of the company s regulators  and the prevailing interest rates in the united states and the company s markets 
in addition  it is increasingly common for the company s competitors  who may be aggressively seeking to attract deposits as a result of liquidity concerns arising from changing economic or other conditions  to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates 
a significant component of the company s earnings is the net interest income of its subsidiary banks  which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets  such as loans  and the expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
a change in market interest rates could adversely affect the company s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it collects on loans and investments  or  alternatively  if interest rates earned on earning assets decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities 
consequently  as with most financial institutions  the company is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
the fdic periodically amends its deposit insurance rate assessment structure  which can increase costs to the company 
under the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by the dodd frank act  the fdic must establish and implement a plan to restore the deposit insurance fund s designated reserve ratio to of insured deposits by the dodd frank act removed the previously established upper limit reserve ratio of 
the fdic must continue to assess and consider the appropriate level of the reserve ratio annually by considering each of the following risk of loss to the insurance fund  economic conditions affecting the banking industry  the prevention of sharp swings in the assessment rates  and any other factors the fdic deems important 
in december the fdic announced that it had established the long term reserve ratio at 
the fdic previously implemented a restoration plan that changed both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
as part of this plan  during the second quarter of it increased deposit insurance assessment rates generally and imposed a special assessment of five basis points on each insured institution s total assets less tier capital 
the special assessment in  which was in addition to the regular quarterly risk based assessment  totaled approximately million for the company 
in the wake of a rapid depletion of the fdic s deposit insurance fund resulting from a high number of bank failures  the fdic required that all with limited exceptions insured institutions pay in the fourth quarter of its following estimated three years quarterly deposit assessments in advance 
this resulted in an aggregate payment by the company s bank subsidiaries totaling million in the fourth quarter of the three years advance payment was recorded as a prepaid asset that is being expensed in approximately equal amounts over prepayment period and  thus  only impact earnings in the normal course 
however  the advance payment reduced the liquid assets of the company s bank subsidiaries at the time of payment 
at december   the prepaid fdic insurance assessment included on the company s balance sheet was million 
as discussed previously under the heading deposit insurance in item  the dodd frank act required changes to a number of components of the fdic insurance assessment that was effective april  while these changes resulted in a lower amount of deposit insurance assessments for the company in compared to  future changes in assessment rates or methodology could adversely impact the company s future earnings and liquidity in a material amount 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits of business customers could increase the company s interest expense 
federal prohibitions against financial institutions paying interest on demand deposit accounts of business customers were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could offer to pay interest on commercial demand deposits to compete for customers 
the company would expect its interest expense to increase and its net interest margin to decrease should it begin to pay interest on commercial demand deposits to attract additional customers or to keep current customers 
this could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   the company does not offer interest bearing demand deposits to its business customers 
any future losses may require the company to raise additional capital  however  such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
the company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain levels of capital to support its operations 
furthermore  in the wake of recent regularly scheduled examinations of three of its subsidiaries  the company s regulators have required these three banks to raise their capital to levels significantly above the well capitalized benchmark 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time and on the company s future financial condition and performance 
accordingly  the company cannot make assurances with respect to its ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
the tightening of available liquidity could limit the company s ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand  which could adversely affect its earnings and capital levels 
a tightening of the credit and liquidity markets and the company s inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits may negatively affect its earnings and capital levels 
in addition to deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments from borrowers  the company relies from time to time on advances from the federal home loan bank and other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits 
in the event of a further downturn in the economy  these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to the company 
the company s liquidity position could be significantly constrained if it were unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank or other wholesale funding sources 
the company s financial condition and outlook may be adversely affected by damage to its reputation 
the company s financial condition and outlook is highly dependent upon perceptions of its business practices and reputation 
its ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged 
negative public opinion could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including regulatory actions taken against the company  lending practices  corporate governance  regulatory compliance  mergers of its subsidiaries  or sharing or inadequate protection of customer information 
damage to the company s reputation could give rise to loss of customers and legal risks  which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition 
the company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services 
the company conducts most of its operations in central and northern kentucky 
the banking and financial services businesses in these areas are highly competitive and increased competition in its primary market areas may adversely impact the level of its loans and deposits 
ultimately  the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  the company s competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
if the company is unable to attract and retain banking customers  it may be unable to increase its loans and level of deposits 
the company s financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
the financial accounting standards board and the sec frequently change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws  regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
the short term and long term impact of changes to banking capital standards could negatively impact the company s regulatory capital and liquidity 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision issued final rules related to global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity 
the new rules present details of the basel iii framework  which includes increased capital requirements and limits the types of instruments that can be included in tier capital 
basel iii includes the following provisions i that the minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets be increased to from the current level of  to be fully phased in by january   and ii that the minimum requirement for the tier risk based capital ratio will be increased from to  to be fully phased in by january  the new minimums will be phased in starting january  basel iii also includes a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to maintain an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets in addition to the minimum requirement 
this requirement will be phased in between january  and january  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and  while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress  if a bank s regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement  the bank will be subject to more stringent constraints on dividends and bonuses 
in addition  basel iii includes a countercyclical buffer of up to  which could be imposed by countries to address economies that appear to be building excessive system wide risks due to rapid growth 
to constrain the build up of excess leverage in the banking system  basel iii introduces a new non risk based leverage ratio 
a minimum tier leverage ratio of will be tested during a parallel run period between january  and january  based on the results of the parallel run period  any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of basel iii includes two separate standards for supervising liquidity risks which include i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that banks have a sufficient amount of high quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress scenario over a day period  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon 
the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on january  the revised net stable funding ratio will become effective january  basel iii implementation in the us will require that regulations and guidelines be issued by us banking regulators  which may significantly differ from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
those regulations and guidelines have yet to be adopted in the u 
s 
the company cannot predict at this time the precise content of capital and liquidity guidelines or regulations that may be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over us and our subsidiaries 
the new standards  however  will generally require the company and our banking subsidiaries to maintain more capital with common equity as a more predominant component and manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities in order to comply with new liquidity requirements  which could significantly impact our return on equity  financial condition  operations  capital position  and ability to pursue business opportunities 
the price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult to resell it when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of its common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section general economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets  changes in global financial markets  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical events  conditions in our local and national credit  mortgage and housing markets  developments with respect to financial institutions generally  including government regulation  our dividend practice  and actual and anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and earnings 
the market value of the company s common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general  including price and trading fluctuations 
these conditions may result in volatility in the level of  and fluctuations in  the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  the company s common stock and sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the market  in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the company s common stock 
there may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the company s equity  which may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
the market price of the company s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the company of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur 
the company s board of directors is authorized generally to cause it to issue additional common stock  as well as series of preferred stock  without any action on the part of the company s shareholders except as may be required under the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  the board has the power  without shareholder approval  to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights  preferences and other terms 
this could include preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation 
if the company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if the company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
you may not receive dividends on the company s common stock 
holders of the company s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if its board of directors declares them  and as permitted by its regulators 
although the company has up through historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock  it is not required to do so 
the company s board of directors reduced its quarterly common stock dividend in january from 
per share to 
per share and again in october to 
per share 
the company also agreed to not make interest payments on its trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without prior approval from the frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
however  there can be no assurance the company s regulators will provide such approvals in the future 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
in addition  the company s payment of dividends is subject to certain restrictions as a result of its issuance of series a preferred stock to the treasury on january  under the tarp cpp 
the dividends declared on the company s series a preferred stock reduce the net income available to common stockholders and reduce earnings per common share 
moreover  under the terms of the company s articles of incorporation  it is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of its common stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the series a preferred stock 
further  until january   the company must have the treasury s approval before it may increase dividends on its common stock above the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share we declared prior to october   which was 
per share 
this restriction no longer applies if all the series a preferred stock has been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury 
if the company is in arrears on interest payments on its trust preferred securities  it may not pay dividends on its common stock until such interest obligations are brought current 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiary banks and certain regulatory considerations 
the parent company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary banks 
as a result  the company s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its bank subsidiaries 
there are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of three of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to the parent company and its ability to make payments to its shareholders  including certain regulatory approvals of dividends or distributions 
there can be no assurance that the company will receive such approval or that it will resume paying dividends to shareholders 
the trading volume in the company s common stock is less than that of many other similar companies 
the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select stock market 
as of december  the day average trading volume of the company s common stock on nasdaq was  shares or 
of the total common shares outstanding of  an efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of a stock at any given time 
the company has no control over such individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions 
given the lower trading volume of the company s common stock  larger sales volumes of its common stock could cause the value of its common stock to decrease 
moreover  due to its lower trading volume it may take longer to liquidate your position in the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance when the company s series a preferred stock and related warrant issued to the treasury can be redeemed 
subject to consultation with banking regulators  the company intends to repurchase the series a preferred stock  and potentially the warrant  it issued to the treasury when it believes the credit metrics in its loan portfolio have improved for the long term and the overall economy has rebounded 
however  there can be no assurance when the series a preferred stock and warrant held by the treasury can be repurchased  if at all 
until such time as the series a preferred stock are repurchased  the company will remain subject to the terms and conditions of those instruments  which  among other things  limit the company s ability to repurchase or redeem common stock or increase the dividends on its common stock over 
per share prior to further  the company s continued participation in the cpp subjects it to increased regulatory and legislative oversight  including with respect to executive compensation 
these new and any future oversight and legal requirements and implementing standards under the cpp may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry as a whole  and particularly on cpp participants such as the company 
holders of the company s series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of the company s common stockholders 
the series a preferred stock that the company issued to the treasury is senior to the company s shares of common stock  and holders of the series a preferred stock have certain rights and preferences that are senior to holders of the company s common stock 
the restrictions on the company s ability to declare and pay dividends to common stockholders are discussed above 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries may not purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the company s common stock unless the company has paid in full all accrued dividends on the series a preferred stock for all prior dividend periods  other than in certain circumstances 
furthermore  the series a preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference over shares of the company s common stock in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
holders of the company s series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
except in connection with the election of two directors to the company s board of directors if its dividends on the series a preferred stock are in arrears and we have missed six quarterly dividends and as otherwise required by law  holders of the company s series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the company s articles of incorporation  the vote or consent of holders owning at least of the shares of series a preferred stock outstanding is required for any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the series a preferred stock  any amendment to the rights of the series a preferred stock that adversely affects the rights  preferences  privileges or voting power of the series a preferred stock  or consummation of any merger  share exchange or similar transaction unless the shares of series a preferred stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity other than the company and have such rights  preferences  privileges and voting power as are not materially less favorable than those of the holders of the series a preferred stock 
the company s common stock constitutes equity and is subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness and its series a preferred stock  and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non common equity claims against its subsidiaries 
shares of the company s common stock represent equity interests in our holding company and do not constitute indebtedness 
accordingly  the shares of the company s common stock rank junior to all of its indebtedness and to other non equity claims on farmers capital bank corporation with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims 
additionally  dividends to holders of the company s common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the company s series a preferred stock and any additional preferred stock we may issue 
the series a preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
the company s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or otherwise  and thus the ability of the company s common stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution  will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
as a result  holders of the company s common stock will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries  including claims of depositors 
as of december  our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately billion 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock after an initial five year period  the cost of this capital will increase substantially 
if the company is unable to redeem its series a preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase from approximately million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value to million annually per annum of the series a preferred stock liquidation value 
this increase in the annual dividend rate on the series a preferred stock would have a material negative effect on the earnings the company can retain for growth and to pay dividends on its common stock 
the current economic environment exposes the company to higher credit losses and expenses and may result in lower earnings or increase the likelihood of losses 
although the company remains well capitalized  it continues to operate in a very challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions  including the company  are being adversely effected by difficult economic conditions that have impacted not only local markets  but on a national and global scale 
substantial deterioration in real estate and other financial markets have and may continue to adversely impact the company s financial performance 
continuing declines in real estate values and home sales volumes  along with high levels of unemployment and other economic stresses can decrease the value of collateral securing loans extended to borrowers  particularly that of real estate loans 
lower values of real estate securing loans may make it more difficult for the company to recover amounts it is owed in the event of default by a borrower 
the current economic conditions may result in a higher degree of financial stress on the company s borrowers and their customers which could impair the company s ability to collect payments on loans  potentially increasing loan delinquencies  nonperforming assets  foreclosures  and higher losses 
current market forces have and may in the future cause the value of investment securities or other assets held by the company to deteriorate  resulting in impairment charges  higher losses  and lower regulatory capital levels 
market volatility could adversely impact the company s results of operations  liquidity position  and access to additional capital 
the capital and credit markets have experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during the recent economic downturn  with unprecedented levels of volatility and disruptions that took place beginning in the last few months of in many cases  this led to downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital 
risks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of limited market area 
commercial banks and other financial institutions  including the company  are affected by economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  value of the dollar  recession  high unemployment rates  high interest rates  prolonged periods of low interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international turmoil  terrorism and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect profitability 
in addition  almost all of the company s primary business area is located in central and northern kentucky 
significant downturns in this regional economy may result in  among other things  deterioration in the company s credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and may harm the financial stability of the company s customers 
due to the company s regional market area  these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on the company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger  more diverse market area 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans 
lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by unanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow  changes in economic and industry conditions  the duration of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral 
due to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans  such loans present a greater risk to the company than other types of loans when non payment by a borrower occurs 
in addition  consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans  but generally carry higher risks of frequency of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
inability to hire or retain certain key professionals  management and staff could adversely affect the company s revenues and net income 
the company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business  including major revenue generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios 
the loss of key staff may adversely affect the company s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively  which could negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses  which could cause a decrease in our net income 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
the company s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company offers online banking services and both sends and receives confidential customer information electronically 
this activity is vulnerable to security breaches and computer viruses which could expose the company to litigation and adversely affect our reputation and overall operations 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is a significant element of online banking 
the company s computer network or those of its customers could be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
the company could be required to commit additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to remedy problems caused by security breaches or viruses 
to the extent that the company s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  security breaches and viruses could expose the company to litigation and other possible liabilities 
the inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the company s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and overall operations 
the company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
the company s customers or others may make claims and take legal action against us related to fiduciary responsibilities 
if claims and legal action against the company are not resolved in a favorable manner to the company  it could result in a material financial liability or damage to our reputation 
the dodd frank act may increase the company s costs of operations which could adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law by president obama 
the goals of the new legislation include restoring public confidence in the financial system that resulted from the recent financial and credit crises  preventing another financial crisis  and allowing regulators to identify failings in the system before another crisis can occur 
as part of the reform  the dodd frank act creates the financial stability oversight council  with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk  and the bureau of consumer financial protection  which has broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services 
the dodd frank act also changes the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators  imposes additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements in areas such as executive compensation and proxy access  and limits or prohibits proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks 
it also impacts areas such as deposit insurance  mortgage lending  capital requirements  securitizations  and insurance 
the scope of the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry  and requires the development and adoption of many implementing regulations that may span the next several years  consequently  the effects of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry and the company will depend  in large part  upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them and the approaches taken to implement the regulations 
the company continues to assess the impact of the dodd frank act on its business and operations and believes that compliance with these new laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs  but the probable impact cannot be measured with a high degree of certainty 
compliance with the new laws and regulations could adversely impact the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  any of which may impact the market price of the company s common stock

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements with the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  under the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
in general  forward looking statements relate to a discussion of future financial results or projections  future economic performance  future operational plans and objectives  and statements regarding the underlying assumptions of such statements 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate 
various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the company s forward looking statements 
in addition to the risks described under part  item a risk factors in this report  factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which the company and its subsidiaries operate and lower interest margins  competition for the company s customers from other providers of financial services  deposit outflows or reduced demand for financial services and loan products  government legislation  regulation  and changes in monetary and fiscal policies which changes from time to time and over which the company has no control  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment speeds of loans or investment securities  inflation  material unforeseen changes in the liquidity  results of operations  or financial condition of the company s customers  changes in the level of non performing assets and charge offs  changes in the number of common shares outstanding  the capability of the company to successfully enter into a definitive agreement for and close anticipated transactions  the possibility that acquired entities may not perform as well as expected  unexpected claims or litigation against the company  technological or operational difficulties  the impact of new accounting pronouncements and changes in policies and practices that may be adopted by regulatory agencies  acts of war or terrorism  the ability of the parent company to receive dividends from its subsidiaries  the impact of larger or similar financial institutions encountering difficulties  which may adversely affect the banking industry or the company  the company or its subsidiary banks ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate funding sources and liquidity  and other risks or uncertainties detailed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s forward looking statements are based on information available at the time such statements are made 
the company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors  new information  future events  or other changes 
application of critical accounting policies the company s audited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices applicable to the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility from period to period 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements  and accounting for goodwill to be the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets 
additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions asset quality and nonperforming assets in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities of the company is impacted by the application of fair value measurements  either directly or indirectly 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in certain cases  an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis  such as investment securities classified as available for sale 
in other cases  management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write down or whether a valuation reserve should be established 
the company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods 
where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices  quoted market prices are used for fair value 
the company characterizes active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information  with reasonably narrow bid ask spreads  and where received quoted prices do not vary widely 
when the financial instruments are not actively traded  other observable market inputs such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics may be used  if available  to determine fair value 
inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes  price quotations that vary substantially among market participants  or in which minimal information is released publicly 
when observable market prices do not exist  the company estimates fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods 
the valuation methods may also consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns 
other factors such as model assumptions  market dislocations  and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value 
changes in these underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded 
additional information regarding fair value measurements can be found in notes and of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s more significant assets that may be affected by fair value measurements  as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by the company available for sale investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis 
available for sale investment securities are valued primarily by independent third party pricing services under the market valuation approach that include  but are not limited to  the following inputs us treasury securities are priced using dealer quotes from active market makers and real time trading systems  marketable equity securities are priced utilizing real time data feeds from active market exchanges for identical securities  and government sponsored agency debt securities  obligations of states and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds  and other similar investment securities are priced with available market information through processes using benchmark yields  matrix pricing  prepayment speeds  cash flows  live trading data  and market spreads sourced from new issues  dealer quotes  and trade prices  among others sources 
at december   all of the company s available for sale investment securities were measured using observable market data 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo includes properties acquired by the company through actual loan foreclosures and is carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value of oreo is based on third party appraisals of the property that includes comparable sales data comprised of significant unobservable inputs 
if the carrying amount of the oreo exceeds fair value less estimated costs to sell  an impairment loss is recorded through expense 
at december  oreo was million compared to million at year end impaired loans loans are considered impaired when full payment under the contractual terms is not expected 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral based on recent appraisals if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the value of an impaired loan is less than the unpaid balance  the difference is credited to the allowance for loan losses with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
appraisals used in connection with valuing collateral dependent loans may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach 
appraisers take absorption rates into consideration and adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to identify differences between the comparable sales and income data available 
such adjustments are usually significant and typically include significant unobservable inputs for determining fair value 
impaired loans were million and million at year end and  respectively 
accounting for goodwill during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that its previously recorded goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million or of the carrying value 
executive level overview the company offers a variety of financial products and services at its banking locations in communities throughout central and northern kentucky 
the company has four separately chartered commercial banks that operate under a community banking philosophy 
this philosophy is focused primarily on understanding the banking needs and providing competitively priced products and a high level of personalized service to those in the local communities and surrounding areas in which the company operates 
the most significant products and services the company offers include consumer and business lending  checking  savings  and other deposit accounts  automated teller machines  and providing trust services among other traditional banking products and services 
the primary goals of the company are to continually improve profitability and shareholder value  increase and maintain a strong capital position  provide excellent service to our customers through our community banking structure  and to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees 
the company generates a significant amount of its revenue  cash flows  and net income from interest income and net interest income 
interest income is generated by earnings on the company s earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest expense paid on amounts borrowed to support those earning assets 
interest expense is incurred on deposit accounts and other short and long term borrowing arrangements 
the ability to properly manage net interest income under changing market environments is crucial to the success of the company 
managing credit risk  or the risk of loss due to customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms  is also a factor that can significantly influence the operating results of the company 
the severe downturn in financial markets and in the overall economy during and created unprecedented market volatility 
during that time  certain capital markets ceased to function and credit markets were unavailable to many businesses and consumers 
the us government has taken extraordinary steps to stabilize financial markets by enacting broad legislation and regulatory initiatives that included the largest stimulus plan in its history 
improvements in us financial markets and the overall economy have since occurred  albeit in irregular intervals and at a moderate pace 
however  certain key metrics such as high unemployment and falling real estate values persist 
this has had a significant negative effect on the company s operations in the form of elevated nonperforming loans  allowance for loan losses  and net loan charge offs 
summarized below are the most significant issues and events that impacted the company s operations during and that are likely to have an impact in the future 
the level of nonperforming assets continues to be the most important issue facing the company 
nonperforming assets remain elevated as many borrowers continue to struggle to repay their loans and the value of both loan collateral and repossessed properties have declined 
these events have been heavily impacted by the ongoing economic challenges that the company s borrowers and their customers face 
the overall result has been lower levels of interest income  elevated levels of the provision for loans losses  and impairment charges related to properties that the company has repossessed in an attempt to satisfy customer loan obligations 
although still at high levels  nonperforming loans and assets decreased at year end compared to year end this includes a reduction in each of the final two quarters of the company continues to develop a culture of excellence through a dedication to providing outstanding customer service and strengthening its credit culture 
as part of its plan  the company in hired a new bank president and ceo with over years of banking experience to lead united bank 
in early  the parent company also hired an experienced banker to manage the disposal of foreclosed properties and to work with the company s affiliate banks in all aspects of managing nonperforming assets 
the company also hired two new chief credit officers  one each at united bank and farmers bank  as a measure to improve the overall credit quality in the lending area 
the parent company and each of its subsidiary banks which have entered into agreements with banking regulators are in compliance with the requirements identified in their respective agreements  including exceeding the required capital levels 
although the parent company continues to explore potential capital raising scenarios  there is currently no directive by regulators to raise any additional capital and no determination has been made as to if or when a capital raise will be completed 
net proceeds from a possible sale of securities could be used for any corporate purpose determined by the company s board of directors 
results of operations the company reported net income of million or 
per common share for compared to a million or

bp return on average equity bp the million or 
per common share decrease in net income for compared to the is primarily the result of lower overall noninterest income of million or and net interest income of million or  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for loan losses of million or and lower income tax expense of million 
an explanation of the more significant components making up the decrease in net income follows 
interest income interest income results from interest earned on earning assets  which primarily includes loans and investment securities 
interest income is affected by volume average balance  the composition of earning assets  and the related rates earned on those assets 
total interest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to million for interest income decreased across all major earning asset categories and was driven primarily by lower interest rates and  in the case for loans  a lower average volume 
rate declines continue to be driven by weak economic conditions in the company s markets and the overall strategy by the company of being more selective in pricing both its loans and deposits 
actions taken by the federal reserve board has also kept the level of interest rates near historic lows throughout  with the objective of holding short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels through in general  the company s variable and floating rate assets and liabilities that have reset since the prior year  as well as activity related to new earning assets and funding sources  have repriced downward to reflect the overall lower interest rate environment 
the company s tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for interest expense interest expense results from incurring interest on interest bearing liabilities  which are made up of interest bearing deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and other short and long term borrowed funds 
interest expense is affected by volume  composition of interest bearing liabilities  and the related rates paid on those liabilities 
total interest expense was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for interest expense decreased mainly as a result of a lower average rate paid on deposits in an overall lower interest rate environment 
volume reductions  primarily on time deposits and long term borrowings  also contributed to lower interest expense 
for deposits  the company has more aggressively repriced higher rate maturing time deposits downward or allowing them to mature without renewal 
long term borrowings outstanding have declined as a result of scheduled principal payments on outstanding federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for the decrease in interest expense for was outpaced by a larger reduction in interest income due to the repricing structure of the company s earning assets and rate paying liabilities 
the very low interest rate environment also makes it more difficult to further reprice already low interest paying liabilities downward 
the short term targeted federal funds rate has remained at near zero percent since the end of net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on earning assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets 
the two most common metrics used to analyze net interest income are net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest spread represents the difference between the taxable equivalent yields on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin will exceed net interest spread because of the existence of noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  which are also available to fund earning assets 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets  their related yields  and the associated cost and composition of the interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and the average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest spread and margin 
the table following this discussion represents the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
to compare the tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  amounts in the table are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on the marginal corporate federal tax rate of 
net interest income was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for interest expense for decreased million or  but was offset by lower interest income of million or 
each major interest income and interest expense line item decreased in the comparison  mainly attributed to lower interest rates 
generally  variable and floating rate assets and liabilities that have reset since the prior reporting period as well as activity related to new earning assets and funding sources  have repriced downward to reflect an overall lower interest rate environment 
rate declines for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were driven mainly by continuing weak economic conditions in the company s markets as well as the company s overall strategy of being more selective in pricing deposits and extending loans in an effort to improve net interest margin  overall profitability  and capital position 
tax equivalent net interest income was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for net interest margin was  an increase of basis points from in the prior year 
net interest spread was for compared to for the company continues to actively monitor and proactively manage the rate sensitive components of both its assets and liabilities in a continuously changing and difficult market environment 
this task has become increasingly more difficult following the extreme market disruptions and economic downturn that began in competition in the company s market areas continues to be intense 
the overall interest rate environment remains low by historical measures 
the federal reserve has kept its short term federal funds target rate at near zero percent since mid december and has indicated that it expects to maintain that rate at an exceptionally low level through yields on treasury securities of medium and longer term maturity structures are lower at year end compared to a year earlier 
the two and year notes decreased basis points and basis points  respectively in the comparison while the year bond dropped basis points 
similar to the short term federal funds target rate  the prime interest rate has not changed since december the company uses the prime interest rate as part of its pricing model primarily on variable rate commercial real estate loans 
the prime interest rate can have a significant impact on the company s interest income on loans that reprice based on changes to the prime interest rate 
the company s variable interest rate loans contain provisions that limit the amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate during the life of the loan 
this will limit the increase or decrease in interest income on loans that have interest rates tied to the prime interest rate 
for  the average yield earned on loans was  which is in excess of the prime interest rate of at year end predicting the movement of future interest rates is uncertain 
during  the average rates for two of the most significant components of net interest income for the company  loans and time deposits  both declined 
the average rate earned on the company s loan portfolio declined basis points to for and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in the annual comparison 
should interest rates on the company s earning assets and interest paying liabilities reprice lower  the company s yield on earning assets could potentially decrease faster than its cost of funds 
should interest rates reprice higher  the company s cost of funds may also increase and could continue to increase faster than the yields on earning assets  resulting in a lower net interest margin

service charges and fees on deposits decreased thousand or driven by a decline in fees from overdraft insufficient funds of thousand or related to lower transaction volume 
allotment processing fees declined thousand or mainly due to the company significantly scaling back on a related ancillary product during the second quarter of the decrease in fees related to this service was thousand or in the annual comparison 
other service charges  commissions  and fees decreased thousand or 
this decrease is due mainly to lower custodial safekeeping fees of thousand or which relates to a custodial services contract that expired at the end of the second quarter of and was not renewed 
data processing income decreased thousand or driven by a thousand or decline in fees related to the winding down of the commonwealth of kentucky commonwealth depository services contract 
as previously disclosed  the company s depository services contract with the commonwealth had an original termination date of june  this contract  originally extended through december  was further extended to june whereby the company continues to provide services and assistance during the transition process 
however  transaction volumes have decreased significantly since the expiration of the original contract on june  decreases in data processing revenues related to the general depository contract have been partially offset by noninterest expense reduction spread over multiple line items categories 
the estimated net impact to earnings is not material 
data processing fees have also declined due to lower processing volumes attributed to unemployment insurance transactions as well as from an increase in paperless payment transactions related to the commonwealth s women  infants  and children wic supplemental nutrition program 
the company recorded thousand in data processing fees in related to this program 
wic related data processing income was thousand for  a decrease of thousand or 
related revenues will continue to decline for the company as the wic program progresses in its transition to a paperless payment method which will be processed by an unrelated third party 
while this transition is expected to be substantially completed during  the company expects to continue processing a relatively small number of transactions that are subject to manual processing 
trust income increased thousand or due to both an increase related to higher managed asset values along with accrual refinements resulting in a one time increase in the amount of thousand during the second quarter of investment securities gains decreased million or and is attributed to the timing and volume of securities sold 
the company sells investment securities periodically in response to its overall asset liability management strategy to lock in gains  increase yield  restructure expected future cash flows  and or enhance its capital position as opportunities occur 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans decreased thousand or 
while the volume of loans sold was relatively unchanged between the periods  the decrease in net gains is attributed to smaller markups on sales in the current year in an effort to remain competitive 
income from company owned life insurance decreased thousand or mainly due to death benefits recorded in the amount of thousand in where there were none recorded in the current year 
in addition  the amount outstanding decreased million in the first quarter of from the completion of the company s previously disclosed plan to liquidate the life insurance policies at the parent company 
the company s subsidiary banks maintain an aggregate balance of million in company owned life insurance at year end other noninterest income decreased thousand in the comparison  with the largest component of the decrease relating to the sale of repossessed business property 
the company recognized a gain of thousand on the sale during and there was no similar transaction in noninterest income also includes a thousand higher loss from investment tax credit partnerships for noninterest expense the components of noninterest expense are as follows for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands change salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  net equipment expenses data processing and communication expense bank franchise tax correspondent bank fees amortization of intangibles deposit insurance expense other real estate expenses  net other total noninterest expense the more significant items of discussion are included below 
salaries and employee benefits  which represent the most significant portion of noninterest expense  remained relatively flat at million 
the average number of full time equivalent employees was for  down or from for the number of full time equivalent employees was and at year end and  respectively 
employee benefits increased thousand or  but was offset by a decrease in compensation and related payroll taxes of thousand or 
data processing and communication expenses decreased thousand or 
the decrease was driven by nonrecurring expenses included in the prior year related to the merger of two of the company s bank subsidiaries  expenses associated with a terminated rewards program previously processed through an unrelated third party  and overall tighter management of all expense line items 
correspondent bank fees decreased thousand or related mainly to a custodial services contract that expired at the end of the second quarter of and was not renewed 
amortization of intangible assets declined thousand or a result of amortization schedules that allocate a higher amount of amortization in the earlier periods following an acquisition consistent with how the assets are used 
intangible asset amortization relates to core deposit and customer relationship intangibles that resulted from prior business acquisitions 
deposit insurance expense decreased million or due mainly by the change in the fdic s assessment base and rate structure that went into effect in the second quarter of under the revised rules  the assessment base was changed from a deposit based approach to average assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period 
the new assessment methodology generally shifts a greater share of total assessments to banks with more than billion in assets  resulting in a lower amount attributed to many smaller community banks 
other real estate expense increased million or and was driven by higher impairment charges of million or on repossessed real estate properties 
impairment charges for include million attributed to a single real estate development credit that was written down to its fair value of million consistent with an updated appraisal completed during the third quarter 
other noninterest expense includes two non routine losses in the aggregate amount of million recorded in the first quarter in which no corresponding amount was recorded in the prior year 
these losses relate to a fraudulent transaction on a deposit account involving one of the company s customers and a write down attributed to uncollectible amounts of property tax receivables at the company s leasing subsidiary 
income tax the company recorded an income tax benefit of thousand for compared to income tax expense in the amount of million for the effective tax benefit for was compared to an effective tax expense of for the continued decrease in projected pre tax income for has resulted in decreases in the effective tax rate as the year has progressed 
income from tax free sources remained relatively consistent throughout and continued to become a greater percentage of the declining pretax income each quarter 
financial condition the overall size of the company s balance sheet decreased at year end compared to year end as a result of a broad strategy to refine the components of its assets and funding sources and reducing the level of nonperforming assets 
significant parts of the strategy include strengthening the company s credit culture and taking a more cautious and measured approach to lending as well as having a more focused effort to reduce the company s overall cost of funds 
in the lending area  the company has been more selective in extending loans as its tolerance for credit risk has declined 
on the funding side  the approach has been to more aggressively reprice higher rate time deposits downward as they mature or by electing to not renew 
the strategy of reducing the overall size of the balance sheet is part of the company s plan to improve its net interest margin  nonperforming asset levels  capital ratios  and overall profitability 
total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million or from year end the decline in total assets was driven by a decrease in loans net of unearned income and allowance of million or and cash and cash equivalents of million or  partially offset by an increase in available for sale investment securities of million or 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflects the company s overall lower net funding position combined with the opportunity to redeploy excess liquidity into higher yielding investment securities in response to a decrease in high quality loan demand 
the decrease in loans relates to an overall lack of high quality loan demand the company seeks as it continues a cautious and measured approach to new lending while working to reduce a high level of nonperforming assets 
loan underwriting has also been strengthened in light of the overall weak economy 
this has resulted in principal repayments on existing loans or loans transferred into other real estate through foreclosure that has exceeded new loans 
investment securities have increased as loan volume has declined 
total liabilities were billion at december   a decrease of million or compared to december  net borrowed funds and deposits decreased million or and million or  respectively  in the comparison 
net borrowed funds decreased mainly due to lower short term borrowings of million or  led by a decrease in activity related to the winding down of the company s depository services contract with the commonwealth 
long term borrowings decreased million or due to scheduled principal repayments on fhlb advances 
interest bearing deposits decreased million or driven by a decline in time deposits of million or 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million or 
shareholders equity was million at december  compared to million at year end this represents an increase of million or from year end and is attributed mainly to other comprehensive income of million 
other comprehensive income includes a million increase in the unrealized gain net of tax on available for sale securities partially offset by the impact of an increase in the unfunded portion of postretirement benefit obligations of thousand net of tax 
net income  less preferred stock dividends and related accretion  added thousand to shareholders equity 
management of the company considers it noteworthy to understand the relationship between farmers bank and the commonwealth 
farmers bank provides various services to state agencies of the commonwealth 
as more fully discussed below  farmers bank was the general depository for the commonwealth until june  as such  checks were drawn on farmers bank by agencies of the commonwealth  which include paychecks and state income tax refunds 
farmers bank also processes vouchers of the wic program for the cabinet for human resources  although this activity was also scaled back significantly during as has been previously disclosed  the company learned in the first quarter of that the commonwealth awarded its general depository services contract to a large multi national bank 
the company held the previous contract which had an original termination date of june  this contract  which was previously extended through december  was further extended through june whereby the company will continue to provide services and assistance during the transition process 
the company is committed to facilitating a smooth transition with the commonwealth and its employees 
as anticipated  significant reductions in transaction volumes with the commonwealth along with the related revenues and expenses have occurred since june  the impact of not retaining the general depository services contract of the commonwealth has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations  overall liquidity  or net cash flows  although gross cash flows such as for cash on hand  deposits outstanding  and short term borrowings have declined 
on an average basis  total assets were billion for  a decrease of million or from the year ended december  average 
average assets decreased mainly as a result of the company s overall balance sheet realignment strategy as mentioned above 
average earning assets decreased million or from year end average earning assets were and of total average assets for and  respectively 
average loans  net of unearned income  decreased million or 
average investment securities increased million or while temporary investments were down million or 
total deposits averaged billion for  a decrease of million or from average interest bearing deposit balances declined million or in the comparison led by a decrease in time deposits of million or partially offset by higher savings deposits of million or 
temporary investments temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company uses these funds in the management of liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
at december   temporary investments were million  a decrease of million from million at year end on an average basis  temporary investments were million for  a decrease of million or compared with million for the decrease is a result of the company s overall net funding position combined with the opportunity to redeploy cash equivalents into higher yielding investment securities as high quality loan demand has fallen 
temporary investments are reallocated to loans or other investments as market conditions and company resources warrant 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgage backed securities  debt securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  and tax exempt securities of states and political subdivisions 
substantially all of the company s investment securities are designated as available for sale 
total investment securities had a carrying amount of million at year end  an increase of million or compared to million at year end investment securities have increased as high quality loan demand has declined 
the company has also been able to move balances from lower earning temporary investments to higher yielding investment securities while liquidity has remained stable and adequate to meet its needs 
net amortized cost amounts increased million or and the net unrealized gain related to investments in the available for sale portfolio increased million or 
the increase in amortized cost amounts is attributed to net purchase activity  which exceeded activity related to sales  maturities  and calls of securities 
during  the company purchased million of available for sale investment securities which exceeded the amounts sold  matured  and called of million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in the net unrealized gain is driven by an overall decline in market interest rates  particularly that of longer term maturities 
as market rates decline  the value of fixed rate investments increase 
the company periodically sells investment securities in response to its overall asset liability management strategy to lock in gains  increase yield  restructure expected future cash flows  and or enhance its capital position 
in  the company restructured a portion of its investment securities portfolio with the primary purpose of improving the projected cash flow stream from prepayments and maturities and maintaining the portfolio s strong market value and future yields 
at year end  the company holds million amortized cost amounts of single issuer trust preferred capital securities of a us based global financial services firm with an estimated fair value of million 
these securities had an estimated fair value of million at year end this represents a decline of thousand or for the year 
the market value of these securities showed an overall improvement of thousand during the first six months of  reflecting an improvement of the financial institution sector debt markets in general 
however  increased market volatility during the second half of resulted in price depreciation associated with continuing domestic and global economic pressures 
the company s investment in the single issuer trust preferred capital securities continues to perform according to contractual terms and the issuer of these securities is rated as investment grade by major rating agencies 
the company does not intend to sell these securities nor does the company believe it is likely that it will be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery 
the company believes these securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors  but rather the unrealized loss is primarily attributed to general uncertainties in the financial markets and market volatility 
the company believes that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates 
none of the total gross unrealized loss of million at december  in the company s investment securities portfolio has been included in income since they are identified as temporary 
the company believes that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities and that the fair values of these securities will recover as they approach their maturity dates 
the company does not consider any of the securities to be impaired due to reasons of credit quality or other factors 
the company does not expect to incur a loss on these securities unless they are sold prior to maturity 
the company does not currently have the intent to sell nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities before anticipated recovery 
all investment securities in the company s portfolio are currently performing 
funds made available from sold  matured  or called bonds are redirected to fund higher yielding loan growth  reinvested to purchase additional investment securities  or otherwise employed to improve the composition of the balance sheet 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is one of the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the impact of the alternative minimum tax related to the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations at an attractive yield is routinely monitored 
the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
the following table summarizes the carrying values of investment securities on december    and the investment securities are divided into available for sale and held to maturity securities

loans loans  net of unearned income  were billion at december   a decrease of million or compared to year end the company continues to take a measured and cautious approach to loan originations by strengthening its overall credit culture and tightening its underwriting standards 
the company seeks higher quality loan demand while it works to reduce high levels of nonperforming assets in a weak economy that has been slow to recover 
nonperforming assets increased sharply in the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of as a result of the lingering effects of one of the most severe recessions in recent history 
while nonperforming assets have declined from their peak  including two consecutive quarterly declines to end  they remain elevated 
each sector of the loan portfolio experienced declines at year end compared to a year earlier 
real estate construction and land development lending was down million or and loans secured by farmland and real estate of other commercial enterprises decreased million or 
loans secured by residential real estate decreased million or 
commercial  financial  and agricultural based lending decreased million or  while commercial leasing and consumer installment lending decreased million or and million or  respectively 
the composition of the loan portfolio  net of unearned income  is summarized in the table below

the company does not have direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market 
the company does not originate subprime mortgages nor has it invested in bonds that are secured by such mortgages 
subprime mortgage lending is defined by the company generally as lending to a borrower that would not qualify for a mortgage loan at prevailing market rates or whereby the underwriting decision is based on limited or no documentation of the ability to repay 
on average  loans represented of earning assets for  a decrease of basis points compared to for as loan demand fluctuates  the available funds are reallocated between loans and temporary investments or investment securities  which typically involve a decrease in credit risk and lower yields

interest sensitivity fixed variable in thousands rate rate due after one but within five years due after five years total asset quality the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated by diversification within the portfolio  limiting exposure to any single customer or industry  rigorous lending policies and underwriting criteria  and collateral requirements 
the company maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the granting of credit is done in a sound and consistent manner 
this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs loan reviews at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a consolidated and subsidiary basis 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable incurred loan losses in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by net charge offs 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using a risk rated methodology 
many factors are considered when estimating the allowance 
these include  but are not limited to  past loan loss experience  an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan portfolio  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current risk factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
actual loan losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the risk rated methodology includes segregating watch list and past due loans from the general portfolio and allocating specific reserves to these loans depending on their status 
for example  watch list loans  which may be identified by the internal loan review risk rating process or by regulatory examiner classification  are assigned a certain loss percentage while loans past due days or more are assigned a different loss percentage 
each of these percentages considers past experience as well as current factors 
the remainder of the general loan portfolio is segregated into three components having similar risk characteristics as follows commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate loans 
each of these components is assigned a loss percentage based on their respective rolling twelve quarter historical loss percentage 
additional allocations to the allowance may then be made for subjective factors  such as those mentioned above  as determined by senior managers who are knowledgeable about these matters 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on the information currently available  additional adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in the factors noted above 
borrowers may experience difficulty in periods of economic deterioration  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require additional increases in the provision for loan losses 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews could result in additional adjustments to the provision for loan losses based upon their judgments about relevant information available during their examination 
in general  the allowance for loan losses increases as the level of nonperforming and impaired loans  as a percentage of net loans outstanding  increases 
the company s allowance for loan loss amount has heavily considered past loan loss experience to estimate current loan losses  and it also considers current trends within the portfolio that may not be indicative of past charge off levels 
adjustments are made to the allowance for loan losses as needed when such matters are identified 
although there were signs of further improvements in  economic weaknesses remain as a result of one of the most severe economic declines in recent history which began toward the end of and early these economic conditions resulted in significant stress through deterioration in credit quality and collateral values primarily in residential real estate lending 
lower real estate values  increased foreclosures  and high levels of unemployment over a prolonged period have all contributed to the company s elevated amounts of nonperforming assets and loan charge offs 
these factors have also resulted in elevated levels of the allowance for loan losses primarily related to residential and commercial real estate lending 
real estate markets  both residential and commercial  remain strained and unemployment rates  despite having ticked downward near the end of  are forecasted to remain high for the foreseeable future 
a slowdown in real estate sales activity creates cash flow difficulties for those borrowers in real estate development and related businesses that primarily depend on the sale of real estate 
the company expects the lingering effects of the economic downturn to continue to hinder its efforts to improve asset quality in the short term 
the company works with its loan customers on an individual case by case basis in order to maximize loan repayments and does not have a formal loan modification program 
impaired loans are those in which the company does not expect to receive full payment under the contractual terms 
impaired loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  at the loan s observable market price  or at the fair value of the collateral taking into consideration estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
collateral values are updated in accordance with policy guidelines by obtaining independent third party appraisals and monitoring sales activity of similar properties in our market area 
at year end  the company had million in specific reserves related to its impaired loans 
of this total  million or is attributed to loans secured by residential real estate and thousand or relates to real estate loans secured by farmland and other commercial properties 
specific reserves on other impaired loans are made up of relatively small amounts spread over the remaining categories of impaired loans 
the largest reserve amount is thousand attributed to a single credit relationship with an outstanding principal amount of million in the real estate construction and land development category 
the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of million or compared to million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses is attributed mainly to the overall decrease in loans outstanding net of unearned income of million or at year end compared to lower nonperforming loans have also had a positive impact on the provision for loan losses 
nonperforming loans were million at december   a decrease of million or for the year 
during  nonperforming loans increased million or to million 
for additional information about nonperforming loans  refer to the caption nonperforming assets that follows 
net loan charge offs were million for  an increase of million or compared to million for six credit relationships had an aggregate amount of million in charge offs during  which represents of the company s total charge offs 
the single largest charge off in the amount of million was secured by a real estate construction project that had previously been identified as impaired and fully reserved for prior to the charge off 
gross charge offs and recoveries by loan category are detailed in the table that follows 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were for  an increase of basis points compared to 
for although the provision for loan losses was lower in compared to the year before  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding loans net of unearned income has increased to at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to at year end compared with at year end the higher percentage was driven by the overall decline in nonperforming loans 
the relatively low percentage of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is due in part to the composition of nonperforming loans  where restructured loans make up of nonperforming loans outstanding at year end the allowance attributed to credits that are restructured with lower interest rates represents the difference in the present value of future cash flows calculated at the loan s original effective interest rate and the new lower rate 
this generally results in a reserve for loan losses that is less severe than for other loans that are collateral dependent 
in addition to the restructured loans  many of the nonaccrual loans outstanding at year end have previously been charged down 
these charge offs have occurred mainly as a result of the company s ongoing effort to appropriately value the collateral securing these loans through timely appraisals and evaluating the overall financial condition of the borrower

nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
in general  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed for days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans occur when a lender  because of economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulty  grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
restructured loans typically include a reduction of the stated interest rate or an extension of the maturity date  among other possible concessions 
each of the company s restructured loans involved rate concessions at the time of restructuring 
nonperforming assets decreased million or to million at december  compared to million at december  nonperforming assets increased sharply during and remain elevated mainly as a result of ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain the company and many of its customers 
nonperforming assets  including nonperforming loans  peaked at million during the first quarter of  but decreased in each of the last two quarters of nonperforming assets by category are presented in the table below for the dates indicated 
december  in thousands loans accounted for on nonaccrual basis loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets additional details for nonperforming loans were as follows at year end and nonperforming loans december  in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial  financial  and agriculture real estate construction and land development real estate mortgage residential real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises installment lease financing total nonaccrual loans restructured loans real estate construction and land development real estate mortgage residential real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises total restructured loans past due days or more and still accruing real estate mortgage residential installment lease financing total past due days or more and still accruing total nonperforming loans ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans net of unearned income nonaccrual loans make up the largest component of nonperforming assets 
these loans were million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at year end the net increase in nonaccrual loans was driven by four larger balance credits totaling million added during two of these credits totaling million are secured by commercial real estate properties and two credits in the amount of represent previously restructured real estate construction projects 
restructured loans decreased by an aggregate amount of million during the overall decline in restructured loans is attributed to a combination of principal repayments or the reclassification to either nonaccrual status or other real estate owned  net of any related charge offs 
there were a relatively few number of new credits restructured during there were four larger balance restructured credits at year end that were subsequently reclassified to nonaccrual loans during these loans had a total outstanding balance of million at year end after related charge offs of million on one of these credits 
each of the four credits is secured by real estate construction projects 
there were two credits previously classified as restructured with an outstanding amount of million at year end where the property securing the loans was repossessed by the company during at year end  these two foreclosed properties had a carrying amount of million the company gives careful consideration to identifying which of its challenged credits merit a restructuring of terms that it believes will result in maximum loan repayments and mitigate possible losses 
cash flow projections are carefully scrutinized prior to restructuring any credits  past due credits are typically not granted concessions 
from time to time the company may modify a customer s loan  but such modifications do not meet the criteria for classification of restructured troubled debt 
the primary reasons for such modifications are repricing a loan to a current market rate of interest to a borrower with good credit and adequate collateral value in order to retain the customer  changing the payment frequency from monthly to quarterly  semi annually  or annually where the loan is performing  the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value and the company believes valid reasons exist for the change  or extending the interest only payment period of a performing loan where the borrower has good credit and adequate collateral value in instances where a project may still be in a phase of development or leasing up  and where the company believes completion will occur in the near future  or such extension is otherwise in the company s best interest 
as a modification is made  management evaluates whether the modification meets the criteria to be classified as a troubled debt 
this criteria has two components the bank made a concession on the loan terms  and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
the company s loan policy has been recently updated to provide guidance to lending personnel as a result of the recent increase in restructured loans to ensure those that are troubled debt are properly categorized 
additional attention is being given to restructured loans through the oversight of the recently established position of chief credit officer at the parent company to ensure that modifications meeting criteria for restructured loans are identified and properly reported 
the table below sets forth on an aggregate basis at december   the types of non troubled debt restructurings by loan type  number of loans  average loan balance and modification type of loans loan type average loan balance in thousands range of loan balances in thousands modification type commercial  financial and agricultural changed to more frequent repayments commercial  financial and agricultural lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan installment loan changed to more frequent repayments installment loan lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises changed to more frequent repayments real estate mortgage farmland and other commercial enterprises lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan real estate mortgage residential changed to more frequent repayments in six cases lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan real estate mortgage residential lowered interest rate to market to retain loan in one case increased payment frequency real estate construction and land development lowered interest rate to market rate to retain loan in each of the loan modifications identified in the table  management of the applicable bank determined the loan was not in troubled condition due to the financial status of the borrower and collateral 
the company s subsidiary banks have not engaged in loan splitting 
loan splitting is a practice that may occur in work out situations whereby a loan is divided into two parts a performing part and a nonperforming part 
this benefits a lender by potentially replacing one impaired loan by one smaller good loan and one smaller bad loan 
overall charge offs and reserve amounts are potentially reduced and the effects of adverse loan classifications may be diminished 
other real estate owned oreo includes real estate properties acquired by the company through foreclosure 
at year end  oreo was million  an increase of million or compared to million at year end real estate properties totaling million were transferred into oreo during  offset primarily by sales and write downs of oreo totaling million and million  respectively 
the million amount transferred into oreo during was led by real estate securing twelve credit relationships totaling million  which includes seven separate credits totaling million classified as nonaccrual at year end  three credits totaling million that were performing  and two totaling million that were previously classified as restructured 
the company sold six larger balance repossessed properties in which reduced the amount of oreo by million and recorded impairment charges of million 
the amount of write down on oreo includes million during the third quarter related to one larger balance property that resulted in a carrying value of million subsequent to the impairment charge 
the company s comprehensive risk grading and loan review program includes a review of loans to assess risk and assign a grade to those loans  a review of delinquencies  and an assessment of loans for needed charge offs or placement on nonaccrual status 
the company had loans in the amount of million and million at year end and year end  respectively  which were performing but considered potential problem loans and are not included in the nonperforming loan totals in the table above 
these loans  however  are considered in establishing an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the balance outstanding for potential problem credits is mainly a result of ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy that continue to strain the company and many of its customers  particularly real estate development lending 
potential problem loans include a variety of borrowers and are secured primarily by real estate 
at december  the five largest potential problem credits were million in the aggregate compared to million at year end and secured by various types of real estate including commercial  construction properties  and residential real estate development 
potential problem loans are identified on the company s watch list and consist of loans that require close monitoring by management 
credits may be considered as a potential problem loan for reasons that are temporary or correctable  such as for a deficiency in loan documentation or absence of current financial statements of the borrower 
potential problem loans may also include credits where adverse circumstances are identified that may affect the borrower s ability to comply with the contractual terms of the loan 
other factors which might indicate the existence of a potential problem loan include the delinquency of a scheduled loan payment  deterioration in a borrower s financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements  a decrease in the value of the collateral securing the loan  or a change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates 
certain loans on the company s watch list are also considered impaired and specific allowances related to these loans were established in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance 
deposits the company s primary source of funding for its lending and investment activities results from its customer deposits  which consist of noninterest and interest bearing demand  savings  and time deposits 
on december  total deposits were billion  a decrease of million or compared to year end noninterest bearing deposits increased million or in the comparison  but were offset by a million or decrease related to interest bearing deposits 
the decrease in interest bearing deposits was driven by lower time deposits outstanding of million or 
the decrease in time deposits is due to the maturity structure of the portfolio  the overall liquidity position of the company  and lower market interest rates 
the company s liquidity position has enabled it to lower its cost of funds by allowing higher rate certificates of deposit to mature without renewal or to reprice at lower interest rates 
time deposits in excess of thousand in outstanding balances make up million of the overall decline in interest bearing deposits 
on an average basis  total deposits were billion for  a decrease of million or compared to average noninterest bearing deposits were up million or  offset by lower interest bearing deposits of million or 
average time deposits decreased million or 
as previously discussed  the downward trend in time deposits outstanding is attributed mainly to the maturity structure of the deposit portfolio and the company s comprehensive strategy to increase its net interest margin and improve overall profitability 
the company s liquidity position has enabled it to lower its cost of funds by more aggressively repricing higher rate maturing certificates of deposit downward in an overall lower interest rate environment or by allowing them to mature without renewing 
rate offerings on new deposits have also had an overall decline due to the low rate environment 
the company has not sought out or accepted brokered deposits in the past nor does it have plans to do so in the future 
a summary of average balances for deposits by type and the related weighted average rates paid are as follows for the periods presented years ended december  in thousands average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings time total interest bearing total maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are summarized as follows 
in thousands amount months or less over through months over through months over months total short term borrowings short term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with year end balances outstanding of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
such borrowings are generally on an overnight basis 
other short term borrowings consist of demand notes issued to the us treasury under the treasury tax and loan note option account totaling thousand and thousand for and  respectively 
a summary of short term borrowings is as follows in thousands amount outstanding at year end maximum outstanding at any month end average outstanding weighted average rate at year end weighted average rate during the year long term borrowings the company s long term borrowings consist mainly of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  fhlb advances  and subordinated notes payable to unconsolidated trusts 
long term securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent obligations related to the company s balance sheet leverage transaction 
in this transaction  the company borrowed million through multiple fixed rate repurchase agreements and used the proceeds to purchase fixed rate gnma bonds that are pledged as collateral 
the company is required to secure the borrowed funds by gnma bonds that are valued at of the outstanding principal balance of the borrowings 
at december   the amount outstanding under long term repurchase agreements was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
remaining maturities are million which is due in november and the final million is due in november at year end  million of the borrowings are putable quarterly and the remaining million is putable quarterly beginning in the fourth quarter of fhlb advances to the company s subsidiary banks are secured by restricted holdings of fhlb stock that participating banks are required to own as well as certain mortgage loans as required by the fhlb 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs which have their own interest rates and range of maturities 
interest rates on fhlb advances are generally fixed and range between and  with a weighted average rate of 
remaining maturities of fhlb advances extend over multiple time periods through  with a weighted average remaining term of years 
long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb totaling million are convertible to a floating interest rate 
these advances may convert to a floating interest rate  indexed to the three month libor  only if libor equals or exceeds 
at year end  the three month libor was  up from 
at year end fhlb advances are generally used to increase the company s lending activities and to aid the efforts of asset and liability management by utilizing various repayment options offered by the fhlb 
long term advances from the fhlb totaled million at december   a decrease of million or compared to million at december  the company has previously completed three private offerings of trust preferred securities through three separate delaware statutory trusts the trusts sponsored by the company in the aggregate amount of million 
the combined million proceeds from the first two trusts trusts i and ii established in were used to fund the acquisition of citizens bancorp 
proceeds from the third trust trust iii were used primarily to acquire company shares through a tender offer during the company owns all of the common securities of each of the three trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sale of preferred securities  plus capital of million contributed by the company to establish the trusts  to purchase the company s subordinated notes in amounts and bearing terms that parallel the amounts and terms of the respective preferred securities 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii mature in and bear a floating interest rate at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion of the total and at current three month libor plus basis points on a million portion 
the subordinated notes of trust iii in the amount of million mature in and bear a fixed interest rate through november of and then convert to floating thereafter at three month libor plus basis points 
interest on each of the notes is payable quarterly 
the subordinated notes of trusts i and ii became redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option during the subordinated notes of trust iii are redeemable in whole or in part  without penalty  at the company s option on or after november  the subordinated notes are junior in right of payment of all present and future senior indebtedness of the company 
at december   the aggregate balance of the subordinated notes payable to the trusts was million 
the weighted average interest rate in effect as of the last determination date in and was and  respectively 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations to make future payments as of december  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total one year or less one to three years three to five years more than five years time deposits long term fhlb debt subordinated notes payable long term securities sold under agreements to repurchase unfunded postretirement benefit obligations operating leases total long term fhlb debt represents fhlb advances pursuant to several different credit programs 
long term fhlb debt  subordinated notes payable  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are more fully described under the caption long term borrowings above and in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
payments for borrowings in the table above do not include interest 
postretirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined and estimated based on various assumptions with payouts projected over the next ten years 
estimates can vary significantly each year due to changes in significant assumptions 
operating leases include standard business equipment used in the company s day to day business as well as the lease of certain branch sites 
operating lease terms generally range from one to five years  with the ability to extend certain branch site leases at the company s option 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
guarantees during  the parent company entered into a guarantee agreement whereby it agreed to become unconditionally and irrevocably the guarantor of the obligations of its bank subsidiaries in connection with the million balance sheet leverage transaction 
the amount of borrowings outstanding guaranteed by the parent company at december  was million  with remaining maturity dates ranging from one to six years 
the million outstanding borrowings are secured by gnma bonds held by the parent company s subsidiary banks valued at of the outstanding borrowings or million 
should any of the subsidiary banks default on its borrowings under the agreement  the gnma bonds securing the borrowings would be liquidated to satisfy amounts due 
if the value of the gnma bonds fall below the obligation under the contract  the parent company is obligated to cover any such shortfall in absence of the subsidiary banks ability to do so 
the parent company believes its subsidiary banks are fully capable of fulfilling their obligations under the borrowing arrangement and that the parent company will not be required to make any payments under the guarantee agreement 
effects of inflation the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other noninterest expense  which tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company has a corporate asset and liability management committee alco 
alco monitors the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
alco also provides guidance and support to each alco of the company s subsidiary banks and is responsible for monitoring risks on a company wide basis 
alco has established minimum standards in its asset and liability management policy that each subsidiary bank must adopt 
however  the subsidiary banks are permitted to deviate from these standards so long as the deviation is no less stringent than that of the corporate policy 
the company uses a simulation model as a tool to monitor and evaluate interest rate risk exposure 
the model is designed to measure the sensitivity of net interest income and net income to changing interest rates over future periods 
forecasting net interest income and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates requires the company to make assumptions about the volume and characteristics of many attributes  including assumptions relating to the replacement of maturing earning assets and liabilities 
other assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected prepayments  projected new volume  and the predicted relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in customer account balances 
these effects are combined with the company s estimate of the most likely rate environment to produce a forecast for the next twelve months 
the forecasted results are then compared to the effect of a gradual basis point increase and decrease in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and net income 
because assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income and net income or the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net income 
actual results could differ significantly from simulated results 
at december   the model indicated that if rates were to gradually increase by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would increase and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
the model indicated that if rates were to gradually decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  then net interest income te and net income would decrease and  respectively  compared to forecasted results 
in the current relatively low interest rate environment  it is not practical or possible to reduce certain deposit rates by the same magnitude as rates on earning assets 
the average rate paid on many of the company s deposits is below 
this situation magnifies the model s predicted results when modeling a decrease in interest rates  as earning assets with higher yields have more of an opportunity to reprice at lower rates than lower rate deposits 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
for financial institutions  liquidity reflects the ability to meet loan demand  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to react and capitalize on interest rate market opportunities 
a financial institution s ability to meet its current financial obligations is dependent upon the structure of its balance sheet  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company s goal is to meet its near term funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset liability management 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
the company s alcos  both at the bank subsidiary and consolidated level  meet regularly and monitor the composition of the balance sheet to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that its subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the subsidiary banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis that can be used for liquidity purposes 
for assets  those sources of funds include liquid assets that are readily marketable or that can be pledged  or which mature in the near future 
these assets primarily include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and cash flow generated by the repayment of principal and interest on loans and investment securities 
for liabilities  sources of funds primarily include the subsidiary banks core deposits  fhlb and other borrowings  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition in our local markets 
the company uses a liquidity ratio to help measure its ability to meet its cash flow needs 
this ratio is monitored by alco at both the bank and consolidated level 
the liquidity ratio is based on current and projected levels of sources and uses of funds 
this measure is useful in analyzing cash needs and formulating strategies to achieve desired results 
for example  a low liquidity ratio could indicate that the company s ability to fund loans might become more difficult 
a high liquidity ratio could indicate that the company may have a disproportionate amount of funds in low yielding assets  which is more likely to occur during periods of sluggish loan demand or economic difficulties 
the company s liquidity position  as measured by its liquidity ratio  was higher at compared to year end and is within alco guidelines 
the company s high liquidity ratio is mainly as a result of a declining loan portfolio  as loans have paid down  payments have been reinvested more in investments securities or other temporary investments due to a decrease in high quality loan demand 
the company has also taken a more cautious lending strategy while it continues to work through a high level of nonperforming assets in an economic environment that remains challenging 
as of december   the company had million of additional borrowing capacity under various fhlb  federal funds  and other borrowing agreements 
however  there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to the company  or that current borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity  although the company is not aware of any events or uncertainties that are likely to cause a decrease in the company s liquidity from these sources 
the company s borrowing capacity increased million or since year end primarily as a result of one of the company s subsidiary banks initial approval during the first quarter of by the federal reserve to borrow on a short term basis up to million through its discount window program 
the company s bank subsidiaries previously had an aggregate borrowing capacity of million in short term unsecured federal funds through a long standing relationship with a large multi national financial services firm upstream correspondent 
due to changes by the upstream correspondent in its business practices and risk tolerances  the company moved a substantial portion of its check clearing process from the upstream correspondent to another large multi national financial services firm during the upstream correspondent also began to end business relationships that it determined no longer meet its tighter risk metrics 
the relationship between the company and the upstream correspondent was further affected by the competition for a long term customer of the company 
as a result  the company and the upstream correspondent were unable to agree on the terms concerning their ongoing short term borrowing arrangement  therefore  the company s ability to borrow via short term unsecured federal funds from the upstream correspondent ended on september  the company entered into agreements during the third quarter of to replace the previous arrangement with the upstream correspondent as described above 
the new arrangements allow the company to borrow up to million in short term federal funds from two separate commercial banks 
of the total amount  million is available on a secured basis and million is unsecured 
the average amount outstanding on short term federal funds borrowings was thousand for and thousand for liquidity at the parent company level is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see note regulatory matters of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  cash balances maintained  short term investments  and borrowings from nonaffiliated sources 
payment of dividends by the company s subsidiary banks is subject to certain regulatory restrictions as set forth in national and state banking laws and regulations 
in addition  farmers bank  united bank  and citizens northern each must obtain regulatory approval to declare or pay dividends to the parent company as a result of increased capital required in connection with prior regulatory exams 
capital ratios at each of the company s four subsidiary banks exceed regulatory established well capitalized status at december  under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework  however  farmers bank  united bank  and citizens northern are required to maintain capital ratios at higher levels as outlined in their regulatory agreements 
the parent company s primary uses of cash include the payment of dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  injecting capital into subsidiaries  interest expense on borrowings  and the payment of general operating expenses 
due to its agreement with regulators  dividend payments on the parent company s common and preferred stock and interest payments on its trust preferred borrowings must have regulatory approval before being paid 
while regulatory agencies have so far granted approval to all of the company s requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividend on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
reference is made to note regulatory matters of the company s audited consolidated financial statements  item a risk factors of this form k  and the heading capital resources below for additional information on the company s restrictions and requirements related to the payment of interest and dividends 
the parent company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million or from million at year end significant cash receipts of the parent company during include million in dividends from first citizens  management fees from subsidiaries of million  and million proceeds from the liquidation of company owned life insurance at the parent company 
significant cash payments by the parent company include million additional capital investment in united bank  salaries  payroll taxes  and employee benefits of million  interest expense on borrowed funds of million  and million for the payment of dividends on preferred stock 
the parent company may fund any additional external capital requirements of any of its banking subsidiaries from future public or private sales of securities at an appropriate time or from existing resources of the company  although the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital 
liquid assets consist of cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investment securities 
at december   consolidated liquid assets were million  an increase of million or from year end the increase in liquid assets was made up by higher available for sale investment securities of million or partially offset by lower cash and cash equivalents of million or 
liquid assets remain elevated mainly as a result of the company s overall net funding position  which has been influenced by a strategy that included realigning the balance sheet and reducing its overall size while managing a high level of nonperforming assets 
the overall funding position of the company changes as loan demand  deposit levels  and other sources and uses of funds fluctuate 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  unchanged compared to net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to net cash inflows of million for the million change in net cash flows in the comparison is mainly due to million related to investment securities partially offset by net cash inflows related to loan activity of million 
these cash flow activities correlate to the overall increase in investment securities and decrease in outstanding loan balances 
in addition  the company received the remaining proceeds from the liquidation of the parent company s investment in company owned life insurance of million in the first quarter of  a decrease of million compared with million in the first quarter of when the company initiated this transaction 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  a decrease of million compared to million for net cash flows used in financing activities declined in the comparison due mainly to deposit activity 
for  net deposits decreased million or  in  net deposits decreased million or 
the decline in deposits in was significantly greater than for as the company more aggressively sought to lower its cost of funds by allowing higher rate certificates of deposit to mature or to reprice at lower interest rates similar to its other types of deposits 
net cash outflows related to short and long term borrowings represent principal repayment activity and were million in  a decrease of million or compared to million for information relating to off balance sheet arrangements is disclosed in note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of providing traditional banking services and are considered in managing the company s liquidity position 
the company does not expect these commitments to significantly affect the liquidity position in future periods 
the company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures  swaps  options  or similar instruments 
capital resources company shareholders equity was million at december  compared to million at year end this represents an increase of million or from year end and is attributed mainly to other comprehensive income of million 
other comprehensive income includes a million increase in the unrealized gain net of tax on available for sale securities partially offset by the impact of an increase in the unfunded portion of postretirement benefits obligations of thousand net of tax 
net income  less preferred stock dividends and related accretion  added thousand to shareholders equity 
although the parent company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital  the company filed a registration statement on form s with the sec that became effective on october  as part of that filing  equity securities of the company of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of million could be offered for sale in one or more public or private offerings at an appropriate time 
the company periodically evaluates potential capital raising scenarios and could seek an equity offering in the future 
however  no determination has been made as to if or when a capital raise will be completed 
net proceeds from a potential sale of securities under the registration statement could be used for any corporate purpose determined by the company s board of directors 
at december  the company s tangible capital ratio was  up basis points compared to at year end the tangible capital ratio is defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets and excludes intangible assets 
tangible common equity to tangible assets  which further excludes outstanding preferred stock  was at december   an increase of basis points compared to at year end consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company s goal is to maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirements 
the company s capital ratios as of december  and the regulatory minimums are as follows 
farmers capital bank corporation regulatory minimum tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage capital tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing a bank s tier or total capital  as defined by regulation  by a risk weighted sum of the bank s assets  with the risk weighting determined by general standards established by regulation

louis frb st 
louis conducted an examination of the parent company 
primarily due to the regulatory actions and capital requirements at three of the company s subsidiary banks as discussed below  the frb st 
louis and kentucky department of financial institutions kdfi proposed the company enter into a memorandum of understanding memorandum 
the company s board approved entry into the memorandum at a regular board meeting during the fourth quarter of pursuant to the memorandum  the company agreed that it would develop an acceptable capital plan to ensure that the consolidated organization remains well capitalized and each of its subsidiary banks meet the capital requirements imposed by their regulator as summarized below 
the company also agreed to reduce its common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of from 
per share down to 
per share and not make interest payments on the company s trust preferred securities or dividends on its common or preferred stock without prior approval from frb st 
louis and kdfi 
representatives of the frb st 
louis and kdfi have indicated that any such approval for the payment of dividends will be predicated on a demonstration of adequate  normalized earnings on the part of the company s subsidiaries sufficient to support quarterly payments on the company s trust preferred securities and quarterly dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
while both regulatory agencies have granted approval of all subsequent quarterly company requests to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities and dividends on its preferred stock  the company has not based on the assessment by company management of both the company s capital position and the earnings of its subsidiaries sought regulatory approval for the payment of common stock dividends since the fourth quarter of moreover  the company will not pay any such dividends on its common stock in any subsequent quarter until the regulator s assessment of the earnings of the company s subsidiaries  and the company s assessment of its capital position  both yield the conclusion that the payment of a company common stock dividend is warranted 
additionally  under the memorandum  the company agreed to utilize its financial and managerial resources to assist its subsidiary banks in addressing weaknesses identified at their most recent examinations and achieving and maintaining compliance with any regulatory supervisory actions respecting the subsidiary banks  not pay any new salaries  bonuses  management fees or make any other payments to insiders without prior approval of the frb st 
louis and the kdfi  not incur additional debt or purchase or redeem any stock without the prior written approval of the frb st 
louis and the kdfi  submit to the frb st 
louis and the kdfi an acceptable plan detailing the source and timing of funds for meeting the company s debt service requirements and other parent company expenses for and  and within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter submit to the frb st 
louis and the kdfi parent company financial statements along with a status report on compliance with the provisions of the memorandum 
subsidiary banks the company s subsidiary banks are subject to capital based regulatory requirements which place banks in one of five categories based upon their capital levels and other supervisory criteria 
these five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
to be well capitalized  a bank must have a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   the company s four subsidiary banks had the following capital ratios for regulatory purposes tier leverage capital ratio total risk based capital ratio farmers bank united bank first citizens citizens northern three of the company s subsidiary banks  due to recent regulatory exams  are required to maintain capital ratios in excess of the well capitalized level under the prompt corrective action framework 
the capital levels required for these three banks and other requirements related to the applicable regulatory exam are discussed below

by some measures  us financial markets and the overall economy improved during however  low real estate values  high rates of foreclosures  and high levels of unemployment continued  which contributed to elevated amounts of nonperforming assets and loan charge offs 
as such  the increase in the company s allowance for loan losses was primarily related to real estate development and commercial real estate lending 
noninterest income for was million  an increase of million or compared to million for the increase in noninterest income was due primarily to a million increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities

the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was due to an overall shrinking workforce and a decrease in the company s matching contributions to its salary savings plan that took effect in the first quarter of amortization of intangible assets  which relate to customer lists and core deposits from prior acquisitions  decreased as a result of amortization schedules that allocate a higher amount of amortization in the earlier periods following an acquisition consistent with how the assets are used 
the decrease in equipment expenses for was mainly due to lower depreciation expense  which is a result of a relatively small amount of net additions to the company s fixed assets 
the sharp decrease in correspondent bank fees was mainly a function of lower volume related to a custodial services contract with the kentucky teachers retirement system that expired at the end of the second quarter of that was not renewed 
the increase in net other real estate expenses was attributed to the elevated amount of foreclosed real estate properties held by the company during expenses relating to these properties generally include amounts to prepare the properties for resale and  in some cases  impairment charges to write down a property s book value to its fair value less estimated costs to sell as determined by appraisal 
impairment charges included in net other real estate expenses were million for three separate real estate developments accounted for million of the total impairment charges 
the increase in deposit insurance expense was driven mainly by higher assessment rates primarily at two of the company s bank subsidiaries that are subject to regulatory agreements
