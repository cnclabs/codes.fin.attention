table of contents including the notes described above  the company has remaining principal amounts of long term debt at december  of approximately  due at varying times from through the company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately  and purchase commitments of  outstanding at december  letters of credit and similar instruments include  related to the defense of tax assessments in mexico 
these assessments relate to transfer pricing that the company is defending and expects to be successful in sustaining its position 
in addition  the company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately  in critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  program production costs  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  pension costs and obligations and income taxes 
sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
revenue from product sales  less related sales allowances  is added to license fees and royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers 
these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs  which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year 
discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale 
while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts  certain of the allowances  such as the returns allowance  are based on market data  historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 
for its allowance programs that are not fixed  such as returns  the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions 
these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues 
during  there have been no material adjustments to the company s estimates made in prior years 
program production costs the company incurs certain costs in connection with the production of television programs based primarily on the company s toy and game brands  including animated and live action programs and game shows 
these costs are capitalized as they are incurred and amortized using the individual film forecast method  whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year s revenues bear to management s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the program 
these capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value  and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management s future revenue and cost estimates 
the most significant estimates are those used in the determination of ultimate revenue in the individual film forecast method 
ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations 
ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to the television program and include toy  game and other merchandise licensing fees  first run program distribution fees  and other revenue sources  such as dvd distribution 
our ultimate revenue estimates for each television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results 
we review 
table of contents and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information 
if estimates for a television program are revised  the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year  are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the consolidated statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised 
prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates 
factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our television programs in the us which are distributed on the hub  our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer acceptance in international markets  and success of our program related toy  game and other merchandise 
for the year ended december  we have  of program production costs included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
we currently expect that substantially all capitalized program production costs will be amortized over the year period through the company estimates program production cost amortization in to be in the range of  to  which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized during as well as amortization of amounts expected to be incurred for programs to be completed and released in future program production cost amortization is subject to change based on actual costs incurred and management s then current estimates of ultimate revenues 
during the company did not incur any impairment charges related to its program production costs 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units with allocated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying value 
no reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test 
accordingly  no impairment was indicated 
the company s annual impairment tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairments were indicated as the estimated fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying value of the related assets 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an 
table of contents appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the company s ability to earn out royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the non recoverable minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties 
at december   the company had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  of which are included in other assets 
pension costs and obligations pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets and applicable discount rates 
at the end of the company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in the us  with no future benefits accruing to employees 
the company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze 
the estimates for the company s us plans are established at the company s measurement date 
the company uses its fiscal year end date as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on plan assets used in the calculation of pension expense for the us plans was 
a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased pension expense for us plans by approximately discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of pension expense averaged 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the company s discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately and  respectively 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   the company s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of  included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to  at december  the increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial losses in  primarily due to the reduction of the discount rate used to value the liability at december  as well as differences between the company s actual return on plan assets and the expected return assumed in the calculation of the expense 
the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december  decreased to at december  from used at december  pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
these changes in the fair market value of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains 

table of contents income taxes the company s annual income tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates  changes in prior tax positions and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions

these estimated liabilities are adjusted  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the company s quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company s quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time 
changes in the company s estimated effective income tax rate during were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction

in certain cases  tax law requires items to be included in the company s income tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets represent deductions that have been reflected in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company s income tax returns 
valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income  including capital gains  to fully realize the future deductions or capital losses 
deferred tax liabilities represent expenses recognized on the company s income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the company s financial statements or income recognized in the financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the company s income tax return 
the mexican government has a tax structure which results in companies paying the higher of an income based tax or an alternative flat tax 
should the company be subject to the alternative flat tax  it would be required to review whether its net deferred tax assets would be realized 
as the company believes that it will continue to be subject to the income based tax in  it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to the mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable 
should the facts and circumstances change  the company may be required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its mexican operations  which may result in additional tax expense

financial risk management the company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in us dollars  hong kong dollars and euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies 
results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar  hong kong dollar  euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and mexican peso and  to a lesser extent  currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 

table of contents to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transactions 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
a significant change in foreign exchange rates can materially impact the company s revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign denominated revenues and expenses 
the company does not hedge against translation impacts of foreign exchange 
from time to time  affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency 
the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts 
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
the company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts 
at december   these contracts had unrealized gains of  of which  are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets   are recorded in other assets  are recorded in accrued liabilities  and  are recorded in other liabilities 
included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at december  are deferred gains of  net of tax  related to these derivatives 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt  excluding fair value adjustments  of  the company is party to several interest rate swap agreements  with a total notional amount of  to adjust the amount of long term debt subject to fixed interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt 
changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long term debt 
at december   the fair value of these contracts was an asset of  which is included in other assets  with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase long term debt 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately  or  respectively 
a hypothetical one quarter percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease pretax earnings by and cash flows by the economy and inflation the principal market for the company s products is the retail sector 
revenues from the company s top five customers  all retailers  accounted for approximately of its consolidated net revenues in and and of its consolidated net revenues in and  respectively 
in recent years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year 
in  approximately of the company s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year 
the company expects that this concentration will continue  particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year 
the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items  and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 

table of contents quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment 
retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s future revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 
the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its practice of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly
