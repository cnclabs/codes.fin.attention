overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 
based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of approximately  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through 
table of contents this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target 
in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as is typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate 
initial public offering and company formation on may   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of the trust at an offering price of per share the ipo 
subsequent to the ipo the company s board of directors engaged our manager to externally manage the day to day operations and affairs of the company  oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company

in addition  in connection with the cessation and outsourcing of afm s internal trucking operations we reclassified a number of trucks and trailers  as well as a warehouse from property  plant and equipment to assets held for sale 
in connection with this  we wrote these assets down from their net book value to an amount equal to their net realizable value less disposal costs with the difference  aggregating approximately million  being charged to impairment expense 
during the year ended december   we wrote down the value of goodwill by million and the value of its trade name by million 
the write downs were triggered by a significant deterioration in american furniture s operations and profitability caused by an unprecedented drop in the promotional furniture market and demand for its product

the following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year  going forward 
advanced circuits overview advanced circuits is a provider of prototype  quick turn and volume production pcbs to customers throughout the united states 
collectively  prototype and quick turn pcbs represent approximately of advanced circuits gross revenues 
prototype and quick turn pcbs typically command higher margins than volume production pcbs given that customers require high levels of responsiveness  technical support and timely delivery of prototype and quick turn pcbs and are willing to pay a premium for them 
advanced circuits is able to meet its customers demands by manufacturing custom pcbs in as little as hours  while maintaining over error free production rates and real time customer service and product tracking hours per day 
while global demand for pcbs has remained strong in recent years  industry wide domestic production has declined since in contrast  advanced circuits revenues increased steadily through saw a slight reduction and increased again in and  as its customers prototype and quick turn pcb requirements  such as small quantity orders and rapid turnaround  are less able to be met by low cost volume manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
advanced circuits management anticipates that demand for its prototype and quick turn printed circuit boards will remain strong and anticipates that demand will be impacted less by current economic conditions than by its longer lead time production business  which is driven more by consumer purchasing patterns and capital investments by businesses 
we purchased a controlling interest in advanced circuits on may  on march   advanced circuits acquired circuit express based in tempe  arizona for approximately million 
circuit express focuses on quick turn manufacturing of prototype and low volume quantities of rigid pcbs  primarily for aerospace and defense related customers

cost of sales cost of sales for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in is principally the result of a larger portion of revenue being driven from the company s tempe operations which carry a lower gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense decreased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due principally to non cash stock compensation issued to management in january totaling approximately million and million in direct acquisition costs incurred in acquiring aci tempe in ignoring these one time charges  selling  general and administrative expense decreased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in advertising and marketing costs increased million  costs associated with exploring new business acquisitions increased and employee benefits increased million 
these increases were more than offset by lower overhead costs at the tempe location as the consolidated production in two locations from three in the latter half of income from operations income from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase primarily was the result of increased net sales and other factors described above

the increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in is the result of lower margins earned on the circuit express product during the year and increases in lower margin assembly and long lead time sales as a percentage of sales

american furniture s products are adapted from established designs in the following categories i motion and recliner  ii stationary  iii occasional chair and  iv accent tables and rugs 
american furniture incurred an impairment charge to its goodwill million  trade name million and long lived assets million aggregating million during the year ended december   which was triggered based on results of operations which had deteriorated significantly during the year 
in addition  in connection with the cessation and outsourcing of afm s internal trucking operations we reclassified a number of trucks  trailers and a warehouse from property  plant and equipment to assets held for sale 
in connection with this  we wrote these assets down from their net book value to an amount equal to their net realizable value less disposal costs with the difference  aggregating approximately million  being charged to impairment expense 
during the year ended  we wrote down the value of goodwill by 
table of contents million and the value of its trade name by million 
in all cases the write downs were triggered by a significant deterioration in american furniture s operations and profitability caused by an unprecedented drop in the promotional furniture market and demand for its product 
the combination of increased unemployment  together with significant decreases in home purchases and availability of consumer credit has created the worst market for promotional furniture sales over the last two years than has been experienced over the last two decades 
the remaining noncurrent assets subject to fair value testing at american furniture are its trade name  totaling approximately million and property and equipment of million 
we do not anticipate any further write downs to american furniture s assets going forward 
american furniture implemented a revised standard costing system in the year which required american furniture to reclassify certain costs between cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the change in format consists of reclassifying the trucking fleet expenses from selling  general and administrative expenses into cost of sales as well as re classifying certain manufacturing related expenses including rent  insurance  utilities and workers compensation from selling  general and administrative costs to cost of sales 
management believes that the format of reporting cost of sales going forward together with the revised standard costing system and the revaluation of standard costs will allow management to timely react to changes in supply costs  product demand and overall price structure going forward which in turn should eliminate the accumulation of lower margin product  allow for more advantageous product procurement and allow for proper utilization of available assets 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and include the necessary reclassifications of costs between selling general and administrative expenses and cost of sales in order to make them consistent with the presentation 
we believe that with the impairment charges behind us  the elimination of the trucking division and the activation and optics supplied by the new standard cost system and associated reporting  american furniture is in a better position than it has been in the last two years  is poised to take back a portion of the product margin it has lost over the past two years and is better situated to absorb available market share  where it makes economic sense in a troubled market  with the backing of codi as their creditor and majority owner

occasional chairs  accent tables and rug sales decreased million in compared to the decrease in product sales is the result of the softer furniture retail environment  especially in the more expensive product categories  such as our motion products  and the increasing presence of asian import product which often offers a better overall value proposition to customers 
the decrease in net sales of recliners  chairs  tables and rugs in is due to an overall weaker retail market for promotional furniture offerings in than in the promotional retail furniture market continues to be impacted by downward pressure from lower consumer spending on new furniture due principally to the limited access to credit available to new home buyers 
retail furniture sales rely heavily on consumer spending for new furniture when they move into a new home 
in addition  the weak domestic overall economic environment coupled with high unemployment has had a significant negative effect on the promotional furniture market due to the impact it has had on the consumer who purchases our product 
sales to value city  american furniture s largest customer  decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to as value city restructured their core retail product offerings and began sourcing product from a small lower cost manufacturer

gross profit as a percentage of sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the corresponding period in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales of approximately basis points in is attributable to i a million charge to write down inventory  reflecting excess overhead absorption based on a revaluation in connection with revising standard costs  ii a million charge related to inventory obsolescence for slow moving inventory  iii reduced selling prices on products in the second half of the year due to cost pressures from our customers and aggressive competitor pricing and iv unfavorable overhead absorption rates compared to due to the significant decrease in sales and manufacturing volume 
a number of cost saving initiatives have recently been put in place  including facility consolidation and the outsourcing of internal trucking operations and frame cutting 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   decreased approximately million compared to the same period of this decrease is primarily due to decreases in insurance expense million  bad debt expense million  commission expense million and other administrative costs million as a result of decreases in net sales

excluding the insurance proceeds in gross profit decreased approximately basis points in the remainder of this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is the result of increased raw material cost of basis points with the remainder of the increase principally resulting from increases in ocean cargo shipping rates incurred in especially in conjunction with the increased number of cut and sewn kits being imported from china

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures from time to time we may publicly disclose certain non gaap financial measures in the course of our investor presentations  earnings releases  earnings conference calls or other venues 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance  financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts  included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our financial statements  and vice versa for measures that include amounts  or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure as calculated and presented 
gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
non gaap financial measures are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results 
these measures are not meant to be a substitute for gaap  and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non gaap financial measures used by other companies

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as they exclude the effects of items which reflect the impact of long term investment decisions  rather than the performance of near term operations 
when compared to net income loss these financial measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non cash charges

this presentation also allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses  provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition

critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting estimates for the company  the trust and each of our businesses at december  the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our management services agreement  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
the fair value of the supplemental put is determined using a model that multiplies the trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for each reporting unit by an estimated enterprise value multiple to determine an estimated selling price of that reporting unit 
we then deduct estimated selling and disposal costs in arriving at a net estimated selling price that is then input into an iterative supplemental put calculation which takes into account  among other things  contractually defined cumulative contribution based profit in order to arrive at the estimated manager s profit allocation accrual required  reflected on the balance sheet as the supplemental put liability 
we review the model quarterly and make updates to ebitda and cumulative contribution based profit 
when appropriate we may change the estimated enterprise value multiple if the market for the particular reporting unit has changed 
we review the model and assumptions with our manager each quarter 
since some of our manager s functions are to i identify  evaluate  manage  perform due diligence on  negotiate and oversee the acquisitions of target businesses by us and ii evaluate  manage  negotiate and oversee the disposition of all or any part of our property  assets or investments  including dispositions of all or any part of our reporting units  we feel that our manager is particularly skilled at reviewing and commenting on this data 
annually  we prepare a detailed analysis of the estimated enterprise value multiple for each of our reporting units  which is one of the primary drivers used to calculate the estimated selling price 
in addition  annually  we engage an independent investment banking firm to review the estimated enterprise value multiple for reasonableness taking into account comparable company data  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow analyses dcf 
the methodology and results employed in the market approach for goodwill impairment testing for each of our reporting units is most similar to the methodology and results reflected in calculating the estimated selling price of each of our reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put 
we typically assign a higher weighting to the market approach as opposed to the dcf in calculating the estimated selling price of the reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put than we do for estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  which accounts for the major differences in value 
the higher weighting is based on the premise that because the manager can unilaterally resign  the company will be required to remit the profit allocation supplemental put value as of a specific point in time 
this one sided put on behalf of the manager is the principle reason that we are required to reflect this liability on our balance sheet 

table of contents the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining certain assumptions used in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecast and a market approach which compares peer data and multiples 
we then compare those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which include allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  and material adverse effects in relationships with significant customers 
we determine fair values for each of our reporting units using both the income and market approach 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long term outlook for each business 
discount rates are derived by applying market derived inputs and analyzing published rates for industries comparable to our reporting units 
we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the financial markets generally and in the internally developed forecasts 
discount rates used in these reporting unit valuations ranged from approximately to in our most recent annual impairment reviews 
valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving businesses comparable to our reporting units 
we assess the valuation methodologies under the market approach based upon the relevance and availability of data at the time of performing the valuation and weigh the methodologies appropriately 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the implied fair value of goodwill at any of our reporting units could have a material effect on our operating results 
in addition  the value of the implied goodwill is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned at a point in time 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of march  at each of our reporting units tested  the units fair value exceeded carrying value with the exception of american furniture 
the carrying amount of american furniture exceeded its fair value due to the significant decrease in revenue and operating profit at american furniture resulting from the negative impact on the promotional furniture market due to the significant decline in the us housing 
table of contents market  high unemployment rates and aggressive pricing employed by our competitors 
as a result of the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding its fair value  we recorded a million impairment charge as of march  which represented the remaining balance of goodwill on american furniture s balance sheet 
we had previously recorded a goodwill impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of of the remaining seven reporting units as of march  the fair value of one of the reporting units was not substantially in excess of its carrying value 
information from step one of the impairment test for this reporting unit is as follows reporting unit percentage fair value of goodwill exceeds carrying value carrying value of goodwill march  halo million a one percent increase in the discount rate  from to  would have impacted the fair value of halo by approximately million and would have required us to perform a step two analysis that may have resulted in an impairment charge for halo as of march  factors that could potentially trigger a subsequent interim impairment review in the future and possible impairment loss at our halo reporting unit include significant underperformance relative to future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
in connection with the annual goodwill impairment testing  we test other indefinite lived intangible assets trade names at our reporting units 
we test the fair value by applying the relief from royalty technique to forecasted revenues at those reporting units that do not amortize their trade name 
in each case we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value with the exception of american furniture where the results indicated that the carrying value of its trade name exceed its fair value by million 
therefore  an additional impairment charge of million is recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  long lived intangible assets subject to amortization  including customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of we tested our long lived assets and recorded an impairment charge of million as of december   which eliminated of the book value of american furniture s customer lists and all but million of property  plant and equipment 
further  we wrote down american furniture s trade name by an additional million at this time 
the determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or the incurrence of an impairment charge allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
escrowed funds in connection with the sale of staffmark approximately million of our portion of the sale proceeds were escrowed 
we reserved approximately million against these proceeds  representing our portion of the escrowed proceeds that we believe we will not eventually receive 
we also provided for a time value of money discount of approximately million against these escrow proceeds 
the remaining funds to be received associated with these various escrows are expected to be released at different dates approximating one to three years out 
the impact of either over or under estimating the amount to be received in the future in connection with these assets could have a material effect on net income 

table of contents deferred tax assets several of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
this deferred tax asset is net of million of valuation allowance primarily associated with afm s inability to utilize loss carryforwards associated with impairments in and these deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit facility because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility at december  our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on million in outstanding term loan facility is hedged with an interest rate cap effective december  with a term of two years 
this cap fixes the future libor rate to be incurred by us at a maximum of 
we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
these borrowings will be subject to variable interest rates 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists principally of i treasury backed securities  ii insured prime money market funds  iii fdic insured certificates of deposit  and iv cash balances in several non interest bearing checking accounts 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
