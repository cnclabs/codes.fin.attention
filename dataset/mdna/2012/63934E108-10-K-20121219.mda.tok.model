executive summary we experienced significant strategic and operational challenges in  but have taken actions that we believe will reverse our course and are evaluating additional opportunities to enhance value 
as a result of these challenges  we announced changes to our engine strategy  signed supply agreements with cummins  and reinforced our cash position during this transition period 
during this period of transition  we are renewing our focus on strengthening our north american core businesses  evaluating non core businesses and engineering programs through a disciplined use of roic 
we are making steady progress in our six guiding principles of quality  cost  sense of urgency  great products  customer satisfaction  and people 
the entire organization is aligned to address three major priorities in significantly improving the quality of our products  meeting every one of our critical truck and engine launch dates  and delivering on our operating plan while maximizing our cash flows 
recent strategic actions over the past months  we have made a number of significant strides accomplishing our turnaround efforts  which include in july  we announced our next generation clean engine solution  which combines egr and scr 
in august  we secured additional financing through our new senior secured  billion term loan credit facility 
in august  we took actions to control spending across the company with targeted reductions of certain costs which included the vsp and involuntary reductions in force 
in october  we announced the planned closure of our facility in garland  texas 
in october  we signed agreements with cummins for the supply of their urea based after treatment system  as well as the supply of their isx engine 
in october  we received net proceeds of million from our equity offering with an additional million received in november 
results summary for the year ended october   we experienced significant deterioration in our operating results  as compared to the previous year  and these results were significantly worse than our forecasts 
a significant contributor to the decline in performance has been our previous strategy to meet epa emissions standards  specifically our inability to meet the emissions standards and the impacts of pursuing that path  as well as a decline in our military related business operations 
our consolidated net sales and revenues decreased by  as compared to the prior year period  reflecting lower net sales from all segments 
truck segment sales decreased  primarily due to decreases in military sales  as well as lower sales to our traditional markets 
engine segment sales decreased  primarily due to lower sales volumes in south america  as well as lower intercompany net sales in the us and canada 
parts segment sales decreased  primarily due to lower military sales  partially offset by improvements in our commercial markets in the us and canada  as well as increases within our global parts business 
for the year ended october   the company incurred a loss attributable to navistar international corporation of billion  or per diluted share  compared to income attributable to navistar international corporation of billion  or per diluted share in included in the and results are the impacts of changes to our deferred tax valuation allowances 
in  we recognized income tax expense of billion for the increase in our deferred tax valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets  partially offset by income tax benefit of million  which resulted from release of a significant portion of our income tax valuation allowance on our canadian deferred tax assets 
in  we recognized income tax benefits of billion from the release of a portion of our income tax valuation allowances of our us deferred tax assets 
additionally  the significant pre tax items affecting our results include million of adjustment for pre existing warranties in  
table of contents million of restructuring charges for voluntary separation and reduction in force in  million and million for costs relating to our engineering integration actions in and  respectively 
for  the charges included restructuring charges of million and other related costs of million 
for  the charges included restructuring charges of million and other related costs of million 
million and million of charges related to the restructuring of our north american manufacturing operations in and  respectively 
for  the charges included impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of million and restructuring charges of million 
for  the charges included restructuring charges of million and impairment charges of million related to certain intangible assets and property and equipment  and the other related costs of million 
million of charges for ncps for certain engine sales 
operating results in  as compared to  were reflective of lower military sales coupled with a shift in order mix  higher warranty expenses  declines in traditional and worldwide truck volumes  higher commodity costs  unfavorable impacts of the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates  partially offset by a favorable reduction of charges related to the restructuring of our north american manufacturing operations 
we also incurred higher expenses for postretirement benefits due to an unfavorable ruling in our retiree health care litigation matter in the fourth quarter of additionally  our results were significantly impacted by the increase in the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets in  compared to the release of a portion of these valuation allowances in business outlook and key trends we are analyzing our options to improve the efficiency and performance of our operations 
our focus will be on improving our core north american truck  engine  and parts businesses 
we are also continuing to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure which could include  among other actions  additional rationalization of our manufacturing operations and or divesting of non core businesses 
these actions could result in additional restructuring and other related charges  including but not limited to  impairments  employee termination costs  and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments  that could be significant 
certain trends have affected our results of operations for as compared to and in addition  we expect that the following key trends will impact our future results of operations engine strategy and emissions standards compliance we believe that our new strategy of integrating egr and scr  coupled with the cummins l offering  provides a technology path to meet epa emissions standards  ghg standards  and positions the company for future success 
we expect this engine strategy will help to address distractions and uncertainty around our engine certification and the continuation of product offerings  which have had a detrimental impact on the company s performance  including a deterioration of market share 
however  in the near term  we expect to be further impacted by the transition of our engine strategy 
the company has incurred significant research and development and tooling costs to design and produce our engine product lines in an effort to meet the epa and carb on highway hdd emissions standards  including obd requirements 
these emissions standards have and will continue to result in significant increases in costs of our products 
in addition  our revised strategy creates the potential for gaps in our product offerings that could further impact the company s results 
traditional truck market the traditional truck markets in which we compete are typically cyclical in nature and are strongly influenced by macro economic factors such as industrial production  demand for durable goods  capital spending  oil prices and consumer confidence 
we anticipate the traditional truck industry retail deliveries will be in the range of  units to  units for we expect benefits from further improvements in our traditional volumes as the industry continues to recover from the historic lows experienced in and according to act research  the average age of truck fleets still remains high 
we anticipate higher sales in  resulting from truck replacement as our customers refresh aging fleets 
we also expect demand for trucks to increase as freight volumes and rates continue to improve as the us economy recovers 
worldwide engine unit sales our worldwide engine unit sales are impacted primarily by north america truck demand and sales in south america  our largest engine market outside of the north american market 
our maxxforce engines are expected to begin to incorporate urea based after treatment systems from cummins in we have made investments in engineering and product development for our proprietary engines and expect to continue to make significant investments in our after treatment solution  meeting obd requirements  and obtaining ghg compliance  as well as for other product innovations  cost reductions  and fuel usage efficiencies 
these markets are impacted by consumer demand for products that use our engines as well as macro economic factors such as oil prices and construction activity 

table of contents our worldwide engine unit sales were  units in   units in  and  units in our worldwide engine unit sales were primarily to our truck segment in north america and to external customers in south america 
we also made certain oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products in north america  which have not historically been significant to our engine segment 
additionally within our south america operations  a portion of our volumes in transitioned to lower margin contract manufacturing for certain customers 
we expect to offset these lower margins with increased global engine and parts sales  as well as lower warranty and engineering and product development costs from our south american operations 
we also expect our south american operations to continue to be a key contributor to the segment results and expect improvements from our oem sales for commercial  consumer  and specialty vehicle products 
military sales in  we continued to leverage existing products and plants to meet the demands of the us military and our north atlantic treaty organization nato allies 
our us military sales were billion in  compared to billion in both and the decrease in military sales reflects a shift in our sales to primarily upgrading mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicles with our rolling chassis solution and retrofit kits 
in comparison  our sales in and consisted of delivering  servicing  and maintaining mrap vehicles  lower cost militarized commercial trucks  and sales of parts and services 
additionally in  we received orders for the upgrade of mrap vehicles with our rolling chassis solution  as well as orders for maxxpro survivability upgrade kits  which are all expected to be completed by the end of based on the current environment  in we expect our military business to generate revenues of approximately million 
warranty costs emissions regulations in the us and canada have resulted in rapid product development cycles  driving significant changes from previous engine models 
in  we introduced changes to our engine line up in response to emissions regulations 
component complexity and other related costs associated with meeting emissions standards have contributed to higher repair costs that exceeded those that we have historically experienced 
historically  warranty claims experience for launch year engines has been higher compared to the prior model year engines  however  over time we have been able to refine both the design and manufacturing process to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
while we continue to improve the design and manufacturing of our engines to reduce the volume and severity of warranty claims  we have continued to experience higher warranty costs than expected which has contributed to significantly higher warranty charges for current and pre existing warranties  including charges for extended service contracts  in we recognized adjustments to pre existing warranties of million in the year ended october   compared to adjustments of million and million in the years ended october  and  respectively 
the increase in the adjustments to pre existing warranties in relates to the unanticipated increase in warranty expense  primarily for certain emission standard engines 
we may continue to experience an increase in warranty costs as compared to prior periods that could result in additional charges for adjustments to pre existing warranties 
in addition  as we identify opportunities to improve the design and manufacturing of our engines we may incur additional charges for product recalls and field campaigns to address identified issues 
these charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  to meet new emissions regulations  including but not limited to obd requirements  the company will launch several products that will incorporate additional changes and added component complexity 
these changes may result in additional future warranty expenses that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for more information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating cost saving initiatives we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
we recently implemented a number of cost saving initiatives  including the consolidation of our truck and engine engineering operations  the relocation of our world headquarters to lisle  illinois  continued reductions in discretionary spending  and employee headcount reductions 
as a result of these actions and the elimination of certain executive level positions and consultants  we estimate these actions will result in approximately million of annualized savings  beginning in in addition  we continue to evaluate additional options to improve the efficiency and performance of our operations 
for example  we are evaluating opportunities to restructure our business in an effort to optimize our cost structure  which could include  among other actions  rationalization of certain manufacturing operations and or divesting non core businesses 
global economy the global economy  and in particular the economies in the us and brazil markets  are continuing to recover  and the related financial markets have stabilized 
however  the impact of the economic recession and financial turmoil on the global markets pose a continued risk as customers may postpone spending  in response to tighter credit  negative financial news  and or declines in income or asset values 
lower demand for our customers products or services could also have a material negative effect on the demand for our products 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain key third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for particular components 
lower expectations of growth and profitability have resulted in impairments of long lived assets in the past and we could continue to experience pressure on the carrying values of our assets if conditions persist for an extended period of time 

table of contents impact of government regulation as a manufacturer of trucks and engines  we continue to face significant governmental regulation of our products  especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters 
we are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal  state  and local regulations 
government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the us federal and state levels 
because our products use fossil fuels  they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation  such as a cap and trade program  affecting the cost of fuels 
in  the obd requirements were commenced for the initial family of truck engines and those products have also been certified  and the phase in for the remaining engine families occurs in january in  the epa and nhtsa issued final rules setting ghg emissions and fuel economy standards for medium and heavy duty engines and vehicles  which begin to apply in and are fully implemented in model year the company plans to comply with these rules through the use of our existing technologies combined with certain third party components  as well as the implementation of emerging technologies as they become available 
raw material commodity costs commodity costs  which include steel  precious metals  resins  and petroleum products  increased by million in  increased by million in  and decreased by million in  as compared to the corresponding prior years 
we continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of market based commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes  material substitution  alternate supplier resourcing  global sourcing efforts  pricing performance  and hedging activities 
the objective of this strategy is to ensure cost stability and competitiveness in an often volatile global marketplace 
generally  the impact of commodity costs fluctuation in the global market will be reflected in our financial results on a time lag  and to a greater or lesser degree than incurred by our supply base depending on many factors including the terms of supplier contracts  special pricing arrangements  and any commodity hedging strategies employed 
facilities optimization we continue to evaluate options to improve the efficiency and performance of our operations 
our focus is on improving our core north american truck  engine and parts business 
we are evaluating opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure  which could include  among other actions  additional rationalization of our manufacturing operations and or divesting of non core businesses 
we have consolidated our executive management  certain business operations  and product development into our world headquarters site in lisle  illinois  which we completed in  and we are consolidating our testing and validation activities into our melrose park  illinois  facility  which we expect to complete in in october  we announced our intention to close our garland  texas truck manufacturing plant 
in july  we announced our intention to close our chatham  ontario truck manufacturing plant  our union city  indiana chassis plant  and our monaco motor coach plant in coburg  oregon  which was subsequently sold in in early  we announced and implemented our plan to consolidate bus production within our tulsa ic bus facility 
we continue to develop plans for efficient transitions related to these activities and evaluate other options to continue the optimization of our operations 
we expect to realize future benefits from the plant optimization actions taken during core business evaluation the company is currently evaluating its portfolio of assets to validate their strategic and financial fit 
to allow us to increase our focus on our north america core businesses  we are evaluating product lines  businesses  and engineering programs that fall outside of our core businesses 
we are using roic  combined with an assessment of the strategic fit to our core businesses  to identify areas that are not performing to our expectations 
for those areas  we are evaluating whether to fix  divest  or close and expect to realize incremental benefits from these actions in the near future 
joint ventures and other investments we have made substantial investments in joint ventures and other businesses that complement our core operations and provide growth opportunities in expansionary markets 
in  we announced that we received approval from the chinese government to proceed with our engine manufacturing plans through our joint venture with jac and expect this to have a significant impact on our global strategy in the future 
in  we also initiated certain strategic initiatives  including an agreement with indiana phoenix to sell front discharge concrete mixers through our continental mixer subsidiary  and the acquisition of certain assets from e z pack related to the manufacture of refuse truck bodies 
in india  we have two joint ventures with mahindra  mnal and mnepl  and the company is in discussions with mahindra regarding the potential purchase by mahindra of our interests in those two joint ventures 
ge capital alliance in march  we entered into a three year operating agreement with one year automatic extensions and subject to early termination provisions with ge capital corporation and ge capital commercial  inc collectively ge the ge operating agreement 
under the terms of the ge operating agreement  ge became our preferred source of retail customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the us we provide ge a loss sharing arrangement for certain credit losses  and under limited circumstances nfc retains the rights to originate retail customer financing 
loan originations under the ge operating agreement began in the third quarter of  which will continue to reduce nfc originations and portfolio balances in the future 
we expect retail finance receivables and retail finance revenues to continue to decline as our retail portfolio is paid down

this increase in sg a expenses reflects an increase in postretirement benefit expenses  as well as higher expenses related to the consolidation of the truck and engine engineering operations and the relocation of our world headquarters 
the increase in postretirement benefit expenses was primarily due to reinstating the prescription drug benefit provided under the settlement agreement in accordance with a court ruling in september for more information  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee incentive compensation expense  reflecting the losses incurred in  and savings from cost reduction initiatives 
the increase in sg a expenses reflects higher expenses in the truck segment  lower expenses in the engine segment  and flat expenses in the parts segment 
in addition to the factors described above  the increase in the truck segment was primarily due to higher provisions for receivables losses  higher advertising and promotional expenses  and the consolidation of the nc operations  which was partially offset by decreased dealcor expenses due to the sale of certain dealerships 
the decrease in the engine segment was primarily driven by lower administrative expenses relating to cost reduction initiatives  particularly at our south american operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we offered the majority of our us based non represented salaried employees the opportunity to apply for a vsp 
along with the vsp  we used attrition and an involuntary reduction in force to eliminate additional positions in order to meet our targeted reductions goal 
in addition to these actions in the us  our brazilian operations utilized an involuntary reduction in force to eliminate positions 
as a result of these actions and the elimination of certain executive level positions  we expect to realize year over year savings 
for more information  see note  restructurings and impairments  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
engineering and product development costs engineering and product development costs increased by million  compared to the prior year period  reflecting higher costs in the truck segment that were partially offset by lower costs in the engine segment 
the increase in the truck segment was primarily due to product development of our low cab over engine vehicle  integration of the cummins l engine and cummins scr after treatment systems into certain traditional truck models  the development of certain natural gas applications  as well as the consolidation of the nc operations  partially offset by a reduction in expenses for the development of military related trucks 
the decrease in the engine segment was primarily due to costs recognized in related to the launch of the maxxforce l engine and lower expenses in for nox emissions technology due to our change in strategy in the latter part of the year  partially offset by increased spending on projects to meet the obd requirements

table of contents income tax benefit expense in  we recognized income tax expense of billion  compared to an income tax benefit of billion in in  we recognized income tax expense of billion for the increase in our deferred tax valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets 
this was partially offset by income tax benefit of million  which resulted from the release of a significant portion of our income tax valuation allowance on our canadian deferred tax assets 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit of billion related to the release of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets  as well as a million tax benefit related to the resolution of audits in various jurisdictions 
prior to the release of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowances  the amounts recorded in income taxes were limited to current state income taxes  alternative minimum taxes net of refundable credits  and other discrete items 
we had billion of us net operating losses and million of general business credits as of october  we expect our cash payments of us taxes will be minimal for so long as we are able to offset our us taxable income by these us net operating losses and tax credits 
we maintain valuation allowances on our us and certain foreign deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not those deferred tax assets will not be realized
