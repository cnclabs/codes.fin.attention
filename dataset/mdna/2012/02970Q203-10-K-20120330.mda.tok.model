item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of american spectrum realty  inc md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements notes 
business overview we provide comprehensive integrated real estate solutions for our own property portfolio and the portfolios of our third party clients 
we own and manage  commercial  industrial  retail  self storage and multi family  student housing income properties  and offer our third party clients comprehensive integrated real estate solutions  including management and transaction services based on our market expertise 
we conduct our business in the continental united states 
our business is conducted through an operating partnership in which we are the sole general partner and a limited partner with a total equity interest of at december  as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the operating partnership 
we periodically examine our corporate structure in order to evaluate if we are positioned to take advantage of the most favorable tax treatments for ourselves  our shareholders and our clients 
we evaluate the potential tax benefits and consequences of a variety of business models that include but are not limited to  joint ventures  partnerships  limited liability companies llc  limited liability partnerships llp and real estate investment trusts reit for ourselves and our investors 
it is our objective to consider all applicable tax laws that legally reduce the tax consequences and maximize the tax benefits associated with real estate transactions 
the reit structure has many specific requirements that must be met and maintained in order to qualify 
as of december  the company s ownership structure does not allow the company to elect reit status 
our primary business objective is to acquire and manage multiple tenant real estate in strategically located areas where our cost effective enhancements combined with effective leasing and management strategies  can improve the long term values and economic returns of those properties 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective an opportunistic and disciplined disposition strategy that enhances investment performance and takes advantage of realized gains 
we typically dispose of properties when the return from selling is higher than the projected return from holding the property  organic internally developed opportunities and in organic acquisition generated opportunities growth of our third party property management contracts and transaction service fees coupled with  an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on mid tier multi tenant real estate in locations that allow us to capitalize on our existing management infrastructure currently servicing our own properties and that of our third party clients 
as of december   the properties that we manage were as follows asr owned consolidated vie s third party total square square square square property type number footage number footage number footage number footage office    industrial commercial     retail    residential multi family    self storage     land total   during the year ending  we had strategically defaulted on the non recourse debt of three of our properties that were returned to the lender 
we sold one property during we deconsolidated four vie properties due to our determination that we ceased to be the primary beneficiary 
during the year the net change in third party management contracts was an overall decrease of thirteen contracts 
we anticipate that there will be fluctuation in the number of third party management contracts due to many circumstances  which include change of property ownership  change of management structure  change of properties ability willingness to pay us for our management services 
we continue to have policies in place to grow our total number of third party management contracts 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to grow the overall number of management contracts and our third party management revenues could be adversely affected 
financial operations overview revenues rental revenues 
we derive rental revenues from tenants that occupy space in our portfolio of consolidated properties 
there are three key drivers to rental revenue  occupancy rental revenues are dependent on our ability to lease spaces to quality tenants 
weighted average occupancy as of december  property type office properties industrial properties retail properties multi family student housing properties self storage properties we were able to achieve occupancy increases in our portfolio s self storage  multi family student housing properties and retail properties 
our industrial properties experienced a decline in occupancy that we are attempting to reverse in the coming year through our initiatives to attract additional tenants 
with regard to our office properties  we saw a reduction in the number of buildings in our consolidated portfolio over last year by five buildings which on average had higher occupancies 
we are currently in the process of aggressively marketing all vacated spaces but cannot make any guarantees as to the speed at which we will be able to find quality tenants or what  if any  reduction in rental rates we might experience 
rental rates market rental rates are often inversely related to vacancy rates 
increased vacancy in the market place tends to drive down rental rates 
our leases typically have one to ten year terms based on property type 
as leases expire  we replace the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
weighted average base rent per occupied square foot as of december  property type office properties industrial properties retail properties multi family student housing properties self storage properties we have experienced declines in our weighted average base rents across all sectors 
the change in weighted average base rent over the prior year in office properties is due to the change in total office properties consolidated from twenty three in to eighteen in and reduced occupancy in the remaining buildings 
the five properties no longer consolidated had higher average base rents  approximately more per square foot than the remaining eighteen 
many of our tenants in our office buildings have been impacted by the economy 
some of our tenants have gone out of business  been acquired  or moved to smaller lower cost spaces 
we are currently actively marketing our empty square footage but do not know if  when or at what rent rates we will be able to lease the vacant office spaces 
the change in industrial properties is the result of a drop in occupancy 
we are attempting to increase occupancy but do not know if  when or at what rent rates we will be able to lease the vacant space 
retail  multi family student housing and self storage declines are related to pressures on rent as a result of the economy 
we have been able to increase the weighted average occupancy percentage over the prior year but have not been able to do so at historic rent levels 
we do not anticipate rent rates to continue to decline in the near term for these properties and anticipate that our weighted average base rent will be consistent in the coming year with its present level 
tenant retention retaining existing tenants is essential  as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
we believe in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering our employees 
we strive to create an environment of open communication both internally and externally with our customers 
of the leases that expired during  we were able to retain tenants leasing approximately of the expiring square footage 
many of our tenants have experienced financial difficulties due to the economy 
we continue to aggressively pursue high quality tenants for all of our vacant square footage 
we can make no guarantees as to our ability to fill vacant space in a timely manner or at the same or higher rents than historically charged 
third party management and leasing revenue 
we derive these revenues from the fees charged to our third party clients for management services  tenant acquisition fees  leasing fees and loan advisory fees for arranging financing related to properties under management 
when and if our third party clients elect to sell a property we manage for them  we will receive transaction fees and commissions relating to the sale of the property 
our same core skill set that influences our rental income also drives our third party client revenue 
many of the fees we charge our third party clients are linked to occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
expenses property operating expenses 
property operating expenses consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance  personnel costs and building service contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration  professional fees including audit and legal fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation associated with our real estate held for investment  amortization of purchased intangibles  depreciation of additional capital improvements and the amortization of lease costs associated with consolidated properties 
interest expenses 
interest expenses consist primarily of the interest owed to creditors for debt associated with our consolidated properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements variable interest entity vie accounting  business combinations  investment in real estate assets  assets held for sale  discontinued operations  sales of real estate assets  fair value measurements  impairment or assets  and income taxes 
variable interest entity accounting our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies is based on accounting standards update  or asu   consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this asu incorporates statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  in june the amendments in this asu replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity 
the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we analyze our interests in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary 
we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance including  but not limited to  a sign and enter into leases  set  distribute  and implement the capital budgets  the authority to refinance or sell the property within contractually defined limits and  b the ability to receive fees that are significant to the property and c a necessity of funding any deficit cash flows 
we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report 
we determine whether an entity is a vie and  if so  whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations  it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 
business combinations we apply the provisions of fasb asc topic to all transactions or events in which we obtain control of one or more businesses  including those effected without the transfer of consideration  for example  by contract or through a lapse of minority veto rights 
these provisions require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establish the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and require expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs 
we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business combination date 
we utilize third party valuation companies to help us determine certain fair value estimates used for assets and liabilities 
additionally  the purchase price of the applicable property is allocated to the above or below market value of in place leases and the value of in place leases and related tenant relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in place leases is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii our estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to below market lease values are included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable lease term plus any below market renewal options of the acquired leases with each property 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date  our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the purchase price allocation period  which is generally one year from the business combination date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
investment in real estate assets rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the useful lives are as follows building and improvements to years tenant improvements term of the related lease furniture and equipment to years we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic  such as the estimated timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets 
the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment 
had we evaluated our assets differently  the balance sheet classification of such assets  depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 
assets held for sale we classify assets as held for sale when management a approves the action and commits to a plan to sell the asset s  b the asset s are available for immediate sale in its present condition customary for sales of those types of assets  c an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset s have been initiated  d the sale of the asset s is probable  and transfer of the asset s is expected to within one year  e the asset s is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and  f actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
we disclose operating properties as properties held for sale in the period in which all of the required criteria are met 
assets held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
if an asset s fair value less cost to sell  based on discounted future cash flows  management estimates or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  an allowance is recorded against the asset 
determining an asset s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 
discontinued operations topic extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity  and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
as defined in topic  a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary  many constitute a component of an entity under topic  increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur 
the evaluation of whether the component s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 
sales of real estate assets gains on property sales are recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided i the gain is determinable  that is  the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and ii the earnings process is virtually complete  that is  we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the gain 
losses on property sales are recognized immediately 
fair value measurements our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting  which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  we use a variety of valuation methods including present value  depreciated replacement cost  market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose 
we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
assumptions must often be made in determining fair values  particularly where observable market values do not exist 
assumptions may include discount rates  growth rates  cost of capital  royalty rates  tax rates and remaining useful lives 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded 
different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities 
since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense  different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 
impairment of assets we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill  if different assumptions and estimates were used  it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 
impairment indicators for our rental properties are assessed by property and include  but is not limited to  significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income  occupancy changes  rental rates and other market factors 
when these indicators of impairment are present  real estate held for investment is evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset s carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  management estimates or market comparisons 
when we performed our impairment review  we determined that impairment existed  refer to part ii
