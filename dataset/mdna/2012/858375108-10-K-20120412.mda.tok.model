our focused assortment of merchandise features current season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  shoes and home fashions 
we report our consolidated financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
to supplement these consolidated financial results  we believe that certain non gaap operating results  which exclude the items discussed at adjusted results for items impacting comparability below  may provide a meaningful measure on which to compare the results of operations between periods 
wherever used below  the words as adjusted or adjusted identify financial results excluding these items that impact comparability

inventories were down at the end of compared to the prior year 
during  we continued to focus on increasing our sales and managing our inventories 
we were disappointed with third quarter sales which were impacted by a shift in our advertising media mix for the largest august promotional event and hurricane irene which also disrupted business during the same event 
coupon usage was reduced by percent during the fourth quarter as part of our long term strategy to present our customers with a value proposition more solidly based on our everyday prices 
we maintained tight inventory control as we approached the end of the fiscal year  which left us in a better position entering  but also negatively affected sales at the end of our fourth quarter 
outlook we expect the following factors to influence our business in current plans are to open seven stores  close three stores and relocate five stores to better locations in their respective markets in the gross profit rate is expected to be lower than in as it will be impacted by our new pricing strategy and coupon reduction efforts see below to drive long term sales growth as well as inflationary occupancy cost increases 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses excluding depreciation grew slightly in after significant reductions in and with significant expense savings opportunities already realized  we are anticipating inflation driven sg a growth of one to two percent in depreciation is expected to increase by approximately million  primarily as a result of the implementation of new merchandising information systems  store remodeling and improvements in our point of sale system 
other income will be reduced by approximately million due to million in reduced credit card income from our new co brand and private label credit card agreement  the million one time payment received from ge capital retail bank in the third quarter of and the phasing out of our magazine program 
the tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately percent 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million with million for continuing it system upgrades and the remainder for new and relocated stores  store remodels and new fixturing 
our future success will be driven by sales growth  which will in turn be driven by our ability to both attract a broader customer base and by having our current  loyal customers spend more with us 
to drive long term sales we are implementing a new pricing and coupon reduction strategy that includes selectively lowering our mark on and creating value pricing on certain key merchandise to reinforce our regular price value message 
our goal is to reduce coupon usage by percent 
we want our customers to know that they do not have to use a coupon to get a better price than our competition 
our sales growth plans also include maximizing trends across the store  targeting merchandising for a more regional focus  continuing our designer and brand growth  re energizing our fabulous finds campaign and more in store events

other income  net 
the following table compares other income  net for fiscal to fiscal dollar amounts in thousands increase other income  net percentage of net sales the increase in other income  net is primarily due to our second quarter recognition of million of other income related to cumulative breakage on unused gift and merchandise return cards since the inception of these programs 
prior to the second quarter of  we had not recognized breakage on card balances pending our final determination of the interpretation of the escheat laws applicable to our operations and historical redemption patterns

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is the sale of merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  available cash  credit terms from vendors and our revolving credit facility 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  our working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter as we build inventories for the holiday selling season 
as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our credit agreement 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on a full year basis 
internally generated cash  along with our available cash and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  will provide the means needed to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
the following table presents cash flows data for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in compared to due to million less cash used for inventories and accounts payable and million more cash provided by other operating activities  offset by million less cash provided by net income plus non cash charges 
although inventories were lower at the end of this year compared to the end of last year  accounts payable was higher due to our lengthened vendor payment terms implemented during to be more consistent with industry practices 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in compared to primarily due to million more cash used for inventories and accounts payable and million less cash from income tax receivable payable including million of net operating loss carry back refunds in 
inventories at the end of were million higher than at the end of primarily due to higher inventory balances in our warehouse and distribution centers 
the timing of receipts and vendor payments increased accounts payable at the end of compared to the end of cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was solely for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in and include approximately million and million  respectively  for systems improvements  with the largest portion for our new merchandise information system 
the remaining capital amounts are for opening and remodeling stores  including upgrades to fitting rooms  lighting  flooring and fixtures in approximately stores in we also replaced our point of sale system hardware during  primarily with assets acquired through capital leases 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in  with million for continuing information systems upgrades  and the remainder for new and relocated stores  store remodels and new fixtures 
the cost of opening a new store ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  cash used in financing activities during we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million compared to million shares at a cost of million in financing activities for also include million for payment of a special dividend of per share 
there were no financing activities on our revolving credit agreement in or  while included the repayment of borrowings 
in october  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na the credit agreement provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility which can be increased to million 
the credit agreement matures on february  the amount available for borrowing was million at january  and is based on of eligible credit card receivables and inventories less reserves  as defined in the credit agreement 
the amount available for borrowing represents the capped borrowing base of million reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
we did not use our revolving credit facility in or  other than for outstanding letters of credit 
we had no direct borrowings at january  and are in compliance with the terms of the agreement 

table of contents impact of inflation we have experienced merchandise price increases in the single digit percentage range in categories that are fashion oriented and feature brand name and designer labels are showing little price sensitivity  while some basic categories are more negatively impacted 
we expect that prices will continue to increase for the spring  but at a lower rate of increase than in to that end  we are reviewing all pricing decisions carefully for customer response and continue to work with our vendors who are optimizing design and fabrications to maintain key price points 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at january  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases capital leases purchase obligations a total a represent open purchase orders with vendors for merchandise not yet received and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the above table does not include long term debt as we did not have any direct borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility at january  other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability  postretirement benefit liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments for these closed stores total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  we do not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require adjustments of these estimates in future periods 
a summary of the more significant accounting policies follows 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we perform physical inventory counts at all stores annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts in any year may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
we receive allowances from some of our vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors 
table of contents related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when compliance issues are identified during the receiving process 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  we could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value  as used in our asset impairment calculations  is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter  or more frequently should circumstances change 
a significant change in cash flows could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
during  we recorded million in pre tax asset impairment charges related to stores closed in  stores closing in and certain other under performing stores 
store closing costs 
we record costs associated with store closing activities when they are incurred  generally the cease use date 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event we are not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
during  we recorded million in pre tax store closing charges related to stores closed or relocated in insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
we are responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of january  and january   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
historically  our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
income tax accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
we perform a quarterly assessment of our net deferred tax assets to determine realization 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to a cumulative net loss on a three year historical basis which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome when determining if a valuation allowance is required per accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes 
based on the return to profitability on a three year historical basis  along with our expectation of future earnings  we reversed our remaining valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of there was no valuation allowance required as of january  or january  income tax reserves 
we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes 
these liabilities reflect our best estimate of our ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if actual results differ from estimated results  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended asc topic  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires most entities to present changes in net income and other comprehensive income in either a single statement of comprehensive income or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the objective of these amendments is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 

table of contents item a

the facility permits debt commitments up to million  which can be increased to million  has a february maturity date and bears interest at spreads over the prime rate and libor 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility during  other than fees charged by the lender and outstanding letters of credit
