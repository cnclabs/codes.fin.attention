artifact sales and other revenues primarily include coin sales  but also include other artifacts  merchandise  commissions  and other miscellaneous revenue 
artifact and other revenues for and were 
million and 
million  respectively 
the increase of

exhibit revenue was 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
odyssey s shipwreck pirates treasure is an interactive multi media exhibit and features over artifacts recovered from our deep ocean shipwreck expeditions 
the increase of 
million in was because odyssey s exhibit  shipwreck pirates treasure  was on tour for four months in versus ten months on three separate tours in the non booked months in were related to downtime for planned exhibit refurbishment after runs at five venues and over  visitors

table of contents cost and expenses cost of sales consists of shipwreck recovery costs  grading  conservation  packaging  and shipping costs associated with artifact and merchandise sales 
the primary cost component is from the sale of coins 
cost of sales for coins increased for versus primarily because we sold approximately more coins in than in actual cost as a percentage of coin sales was and in and  respectively 
there is no cost of sales component associated with the themed attraction and expedition charter revenues 
operations and research expenses primarily include all costs within archaeology  conservation  research  and marine operations  which include all vessel and charter operations 
operations and research expenses were million in  compared to million in the unfavorable variance of million was primarily due to vessel operations 
the unfavorable variance of million for the dorado discovery was the vessel only worked six months in  but worked twelve months in the odyssey explorer was unfavorable 
million primarily due to repairs and maintenance 
the ocean alert was favorable 
million which is net of the 
million loss on the disposal of the asset since it was not working in and was sold in september 
the remaining favorable variance of 
million was due to the timing of project ship charters 
in  we chartered the kommandor stuart for seven months which worked on various shipwreck and commercial projects 
in  the russian search vessel rv yuzhmorgeologiya was chartered for approximately days for work on the gairsoppa and mantola projects 
marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily include all costs within the following departments executive  finance accounting  legal  information technology  human resources  marketing communications  sales and business development 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in versus million in the increase was primarily attributable to bank fees associated with renewal of our term loan in may odyssey did not have any additional receivable reserves in the receivable reserves of million recognized in are discussed further in the section compared to included within this section in item other income or expense other income and expense generally consists of interest income on investments offset by interest expense on our revolving credit facility and other loans

income taxes we did not record any provision benefit for income taxes in or due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets as of december  compared to million as of december  as required by the accounting for income taxes topic in the accounting standards codification asc  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in pending any shipwreck cargo recoveries that could be quickly monetized ie  gairsoppa or victory projects 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period

see note l to the consolidated financial statements 
during december  we chartered the dorado discovery vessel to chatham rock phosphate  ltd 
for million in relation to deep ocean surveying 
the charter permits chatham to pay for services in either cash or common shares of their company 
at december   chatham was planning on a financing to pay for the charter 
we did not record the revenue from this charter because of their liquidity and capital positions at that time 
if and when chatham completes their financing and remits payment to us  we will then recognize this revenue since all revenue accounting criteria will be satisfied 
if the customer remits shares  this would relate to approximately million shares which equates to an approximate ownership based on their december  capital structure 
we were informed in march that the capital raise is expected to be completed shortly that will pay us million for work performed and additional charter services 
odyssey is planning on completing an additional second phase charter for chatham rock phosphate by early april  assuming the financing has been completed 
the first charter consisted of geophysical  environmental and sampling operations 
bank term loan on may   we amended our revolving credit facility to replace it with a million term loan maturing on april  a principal payment of million was due and paid by august  with the remainder due upon maturity 
the facility bears a floating interest rate at the one month libor rate according to the wall street journal plus basis points 
any prepayments made in full or in part are without premium or penalty 
a commitment fee of  was payable at closing 
no restricted cash payments will need to be kept on deposit 
as a condition to the loan renewal  we were required to amend the mortgage loan whereby we are required to pay additional principal to meet an loan to value ltv based upon an independent real estate appraisal 
the additional principal payments will be at  per month until the loan balance meets the ltv 
based on this condition  we commenced the repayment of 
million starting in july the amended term loan is secured by approximately  numismatic coins recovered from the ss republic shipwreck  which amount will be reduced over the term by the amount of coins sold by the company 
the coins used as collateral are held by a custodian for the security of the bank 
the borrowing base is equal to forty percent of the eligible coin inventory valued on a rolling twelve month wholesale average value million as of december  
the company is required to comply with a number of customary covenants 
in march  the bank provided odyssey a term sheet which increases the term loan to million an additional million with similar terms and conditions as our existing term loan 
we expect to close on this new term loan within the next month 

table of contents trends and uncertainties our current business plan estimates positive cash flow from operating activities 
the plan contains assumptions which include that several of our planned projects are funded through project debt type financings  syndications or other partnership opportunities 
the business plan expenses include a day charter agreement which we recently executed with a company to provide a ship and equipment to conduct recovery operations on the gairsoppa and mantola projects see note w of the consolidated financial statements 
one or more of these projected project financing or partnership opportunities may not be realized which may require the need for additional cash 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our cash position will be sufficient to fund operating cash flows throughout the rest of taking into account our beginning cash balance  current cash flow expectations and revenues from multiple sources  including projected sales  syndicated projects and potential debt financing opportunities and the available million convertible debt facility we have recently received a term sheet from fifth third bank which will increase our existing term loan to million through july we have experienced several years of net losses resulting in a stockholders deficit 
our capacity to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing high value shipwrecks  or to generate income from other projects 
however  it is likely that we could monetize a significant portion of the gairsoppa and mantola projects in which could fund our operations for future periods 
if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to raise additional capital or curtail expenses 
while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in compared to vs

our second chartered vessel  which comprised million of the increase  was deployed during the second quarter to work on the shantaram project and then was sub chartered to a third party in the third quarter and went off charter in the fourth quarter 
the unfavorable charter variances were primarily offset by favorable variances for our two owned vessels  most of which represented the ocean alert which has been in port for the latter part of the ocean alert was sold in september marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in versus million in the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced corporate overhead of

realizability of deferred tax assets we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of at december  as required by the accounting for income taxes topic in the asc  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery and rights of ownership or salvage rights of high value shipwrecks and thus a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december  artifact inventory the value of recovered artifacts in inventory includes the costs of recovery and conservation 
the capitalized costs include direct costs of recovery such as vessel and related equipment operations and maintenance  crew and technical labor  fuel  provisions  supplies  port fees  depreciation and may even include fees paid to an insurer to relinquish the insurer s claim to the recovered artifacts 
conservation costs include fees paid to conservators for cleaning and preserving the artifacts 
we continually monitor the recorded aggregate costs of the artifacts in inventory to ensure these costs do not exceed the net realizable value 
we use historical sales  publications or available public market data to assess market value 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the collectability of our accounts receivable  we need to make certain assumptions and estimates 
specifically  we may examine accounts and assess the likelihood of collection of particular accounts 
derivative financial instruments in evaluating fair value of derivative financial instruments  there are numerous assumptions which management must make that may influence the valuation of the derivatives as included in the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
we do not believe we have material market risk exposure and have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments to mitigate these risks or for trading or speculative purposes 
our term loan bears a variable interest rate based on libor and our primary mortgage bears interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate 
see note l for further detail on these instruments 
both of these instruments expose us to interest rate risk 
on our primary mortgage  for an increase of every basis points  our interest obligation increases  at most  by approximately  per month until maturity in july on our term loan  an increase of every basis points to the interest rate increases our interest obligation  at most  by approximately  per month until maturity in april if an increase to the rates on these instruments occurs  it will have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows and financial condition but we believe it would not be material
