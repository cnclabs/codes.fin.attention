item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic conditions and utility load growth for information on economic conditions in our service territory 
electric operations in addition to providing electric distribution and transmission services  we generate electricity from facilities that we own and we purchase capacity and energy and fuel for generation under long term and short term contracts 
we also sell electric capacity and energy  as well as surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below 
as part of our resource procurement and management operations in the electric business  we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization  which involves the economic selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture available economic value 
we sell and purchase electric capacity and energy and fuel in wholesale markets as part of the process of acquiring and balancing resources to serve our load obligations 
these transactions range from terms of minutes up to multiple years 
we make continuing projections of electric loads at various points in time ranging from minutes to multiple years based on  among other things  estimates of customer usage and weather  historical data and contract terms  and resource availability at these points in time based on  among other things  fuel choices and fuel markets  estimates of streamflows  availability of generating units  historic and forward market information  contract terms  and experience 
on the basis of these projections  we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy and fuel to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements 
resource optimization involves generating plant dispatch and scheduling available resources and also includes transactions such as purchasing fuel for generation  when economical  selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases  and other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generation and transmission resources and fuel delivery capacity contracts 
our optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks 
our generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load serving capability and reliability 
we provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern washington  northern idaho and western montana 
transmission revenues were million in  million in and million in electric requirements our peak electric native load requirement for occurred on january  at which time our total obligation was  mw consisting of native load of  mw  long term wholesale obligations of mw  and short term wholesale obligations of mw 
at that time our maximum resource capacity available was  mw  which included company owned or controlled electric generation of  mw  long term hydroelectric contracts with certain public utility districts puds of mw  long term thermal generation contract with lancaster plant of mw  
table of contents avista corporation other long term wholesale contracts of mw  and short term wholesale purchases of mw 
electric resources we have a diverse electric resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges 
at the end of  our facilities had a total net capability of  mw  of which percent was hydroelectric and percent was thermal 
see item properties for detailed information on generating facilities 
hydroelectric resources we own and operate six hydroelectric projects on the spokane river and two hydroelectric projects on the clark fork river 
hydroelectric generation is our lowest cost source per megawatt hour mwh of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs 
under normal streamflow and operating conditions  we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one half of our total average electric requirements both retail and long term wholesale with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain puds in the state of washington 
our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric generation for including resources purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts with certain puds is average megawatts amw or million mwhs

a combination of long term contracts and spot purchases has provided  and is expected to meet  fuel requirements for the kettle falls gs 
the northeast ct  rathdrum ct  boulder park and kettle falls ct generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements 
we also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices 
these generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs

palouse wind ppa in june  we entered into a year ppa with palouse wind  llc palouse wind  an affiliate of first wind holdings  llc 
under the ppa  we will acquire all of the power and renewable attributes produced by a wind project being developed by palouse wind in whitman county  washington 
the wind project is expected to have a nameplate capacity of approximately mw and produce approximately amw with deliveries by the end of we decided to enter this ppa due  in part  to market changes reducing the cost of renewable resource projects 
this was due  in part  to tax incentives for the construction of renewable resource projects that remain in effect through the power purchased from palouse wind will help to meet our washington renewable energy requirements beginning in  as well as provide a new energy resource to serve our system retail load requirements 
under the ppa  we have the option to purchase the wind project each year following the th anniversary of the commercial operation date at a price determined under the contract 
other purchases  exchanges and sales we purchase and sell power under various long term contracts 
we also enter into short term purchases and sales 
see electric operations for additional information with respect to the use of wholesale purchases and sales as part of our resource optimization process 
pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  as amended  we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities

table of contents avista corporation future resource needs we have operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions 
these operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed over minute  hourly  daily  monthly and annual durations  which vary widely because of the factors that influence demand 
our average hourly load was  amw in   amw in and  amw in the following is a forecast of our average annual energy requirements and resources for   and forecasted electric energy requirements and resources amw requirements system load contracts for power sales total requirements resources company owned and contract hydro generation company owned base load thermal generation contracts for power purchases total resources surplus resources additional available energy total surplus resources the forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation decline in and is due to changes in contracts with puds 
excludes the northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
we generally use our thermal resources to meet electric load requirements due to either below normal hydroelectric generation or increased loads or outages at other generating facilities  and or when operating costs are lower than short term wholesale market prices 
northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
the combined maximum capacity of the northeast ct and rathdrum ct is mw  with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year 
in august  we filed our electric integrated resource plan irp with the wutc and the ipuc 
we are required to file an irp every two years 
the irp details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next years 
we regard the irp as a tool for resource evaluation  rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project 
highlights of the irp include a contract for the mw palouse wind  llc project  which is expected to help meet the requirements of the washington state energy independence act beginning in  as well as provide a new resource to serve our customers increasing energy needs 
an additional amw of wind or qualifying renewable resource or energy credits are required under the same act beginning in energy efficiency measures are expected to save amw of cumulative energy over the year irp timeframe 
this aggressive effort could reduce load growth to half of what it would be without these measures 
mw of new natural gas fired generation facilities are required between and three grid modernization programs are projected to save amw of energy by transmission upgrades will be needed to deliver the energy from new generation resources to the distribution lines serving customers 
we will continue to participate in regional efforts to expand the region s transmission system 
we are subject to the washington state energy independence act  which includes renewable energy portfolio standards and we must obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of renewable energy credits 
future generation resource decisions will be impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental issues and other contingencies for information related to existing laws  as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix 

table of contents avista corporation natural gas operations general we provide natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern washington  northern idaho  and parts of northeast and southwest oregon 
market prices for natural gas  like other commodities  can be volatile 
to provide reliable supply and to manage the impact of volatile prices on our customers  we procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and over various time periods 
we also use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 
like prices  natural gas loads can also be volatile 
daily natural gas loads can differ significantly from the monthly load projections 
we make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources 
on the basis of these projections  we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a significant portion of our projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments 
these transactions may extend for multiple years into the future with the highest volumes hedged for the current and most immediately upcoming natural gas operating year november through october 
we also leave a significant portion of our natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in short term and spot markets 
as part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources  we engage in wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas 
we plan for sufficient natural gas delivery capacity to serve our retail customers on a theoretical peak day 
as such  we generally have more pipeline and storage capacity than what is needed 
we optimize natural gas resources by using excess resources and market opportunities to generate economic value that offsets net natural gas costs 
wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system 
natural gas resource optimization activities include  but are not limited to wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies  purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage capacity 
we also provide transportation service to certain large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third party marketers 
for these customers  we move their natural gas through our distribution system from natural gas transmission pipeline delivery points to the customers premises 
natural gas supply we purchase all of our natural gas in wholesale markets 
we are connected to multiple supply basins in the western united states and western canada through firm capacity delivery rights on six pipeline networks 
access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our natural gas customers 
we have interstate pipeline capacity to serve approximately percent of natural gas supplies from domestic sources  with the remaining percent from canadian sources 
natural gas prices in the pacific northwest are affected by global energy markets  as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the united states and canada 
future prices and delivery constraints may cause our source mix to vary 
natural gas storage we own a one third interest in the jackson prairie natural gas storage project jackson prairie  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
jackson prairie has a total peak day deliverability of million therms  with a total working natural gas capacity of million therms 
avista utilities gained million therms of additional capacity at jackson prairie on may  for use in its utility operations 
this capacity was originally held by avista energy and as part of the asset sales agreement this capacity had been assigned to shell energy through april  natural gas storage enables us to place natural gas into storage when prices may be lower or to satisfy minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to meet high demand periods or to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are higher 
regulatory issues general as a regulated public utility  we are subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc  the ipuc  the public utility commission of oregon opuc  and the public service commission of the state of montana montana commission 
approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the montana commission 
we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources  and for electric transmission services and wholesale sales 
our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 

table of contents avista corporation rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write offs as authorized by the utility commissions 
in general  a request for new rates in washington and idaho is made on the basis of net investment as of a date  and operating expenses and revenues for a test period ended  prior to the date of the request 
our retail revenues are derived from the number of units of electricity or natural gas actually sold and rates are based on the assumption that sales of electricity and natural gas will be the same as during the test period 
although the current ratemaking process in these states provides recovery of some future changes in net investment  operating costs and revenues  it does not reflect all changes in costs for the period in which new retail rates will be in place 
this historically has resulted in a lag between the time we incur costs and the time when we start recovering the costs through subsequent changes in rates 
oregon currently allows a forecasted test year  which generally is more effective in providing timely recovery of costs 
in washington  there is currently a proposal for an electric decoupling mechanism 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters proposed electric decoupling washington for further information 
our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either cost of service principles or market based rates as set forth by the ferc 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about regulation  depreciation and deferred income taxes 
general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases for information on general rate case activity 
power cost deferrals we defer the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the wutc and the ipuc 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington and idaho 
purchased gas adjustment pga under established regulatory practices in each respective state  we are allowed to adjust natural gas rates periodically with regulatory approval to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas purchased 
differences between actual natural gas costs and the natural gas costs included in retail rates are deferred and charged or credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in rates 
we typically propose such adjustments at least once per year 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters purchased gas adjustments and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on natural gas cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington  idaho and oregon 
federal laws related to wholesale competition federal law promotes practices that open the electric wholesale energy market to competition 
the ferc requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
public utilities through subsidiaries and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers 
public utilities operating under the federal power act are required to provide open and non discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an open access same time information system to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access 
the ferc also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users  including the public utility s power merchant operations  have equal access to the public utility s transmission system 
our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation  maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations competition for further information 

table of contents avista corporation regional transmission organizations beginning with ferc orders no 
and no 
issued in and continuing with subsequent rulemakings and policies including the variable energy resource notice of proposed rulemaking  the ferc has encouraged better coordination and operational consistency aimed to capture efficiencies that might otherwise be gained through the formation of a regional transmission organization rto such as an independent system operator iso 
while it has not mandated rto formation  the ferc has issued orders and made public policy statements indicating its support for the development and formation of independent organizations  including those intended to implement a number of regional transmission planning coordination requirements 
we have participated in discussions with transmission providers and other stakeholders in the pacific northwest for several years regarding the possible formation of an iso in the region 
we ultimately became a member of columbiagrid  a washington nonprofit membership corporation with an independent slate of directors formed to improve the operational efficiency  reliability  and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the pacific northwest 
columbiagrid is not an iso  but performs limited functions as set forth in specific agreements with columbiagrid members and other stakeholders 
columbiagrid and its members also work with other western organizations to address operational efficiencies  including westconnect and the northern tier transmission group 
we will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with columbiagrid and or participating in other forums to attain operational efficiencies and to meet ferc policy objectives 
the ferc requires rtos to provide various data and is currently requesting non rto regions to report similar data for the purpose of establishing performance metrics 
we expect the ferc to use this data to compare rto and non rto regions 
we cannot foresee what policy objectives the ferc may develop as a result of establishing such performance metrics 
reliability standards among its other provisions  the us energy policy act provides for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorizes the ferc to assess fines for non compliance with these standards and other ferc regulations 
the ferc certified the north american electricity reliability corporation nerc as the single electric reliability organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards 
the ferc has approved nerc reliability standards  including western region standards  making up the set of legally enforceable standards for the united states bulk electric system 
the first of these reliability standards became effective in june we are required to self certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the nerc and its regional entity  the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
our failure to comply with these standards could result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
annual self certification and audit processes to date have demonstrated our substantial compliance with these standards

table of contents avista corporation item a 
risk factors risk factors the following factors could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report on form k  and elsewhere 
please also see forward looking statements for additional factors which could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements 
weather temperatures  precipitation levels and storms has a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
weather impacts are described in the following subtopics retail electricity and natural gas sales  the cost of natural gas supply  the cost of power supply  and damages to facilities 
retail electricity and natural gas sales volumes vary directly with changes in temperatures 
we normally have our highest retail electric and natural gas energy sales during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
we also have high electricity demand for air conditioning during the summer third quarter 
in general  warmer weather in the heating season and cooler weather in the cooling season will reduce our customers energy demand and retail operating revenues 
the cost of natural gas supply tends to increase with increased demand during periods of cold weather 
increased costs adversely affect cash flows when we purchase natural gas for retail supply at prices above the amount then allowed for recovery in retail rates 
we defer differences between actual natural gas supply costs and the amount currently recovered in retail rates and we have generally been allowed to recover substantially all of these differences after regulatory review 
however  these deferred costs require cash outflows from the time of natural gas purchases until the costs are later recovered through retail sales 
the cost of power supply can be significantly impacted by weather 
precipitation consisting of snowpack  its water content and melting pattern plus rainfall and other streamflow conditions such as regional water storage operations significantly affect hydroelectric generation capability 
variations in hydroelectric generation inversely affect our reliance on market purchases and thermal generation 
to the extent that hydroelectric generation is less than normal  significantly more costly power supply resources must be acquired and the ability to realize net benefits from surplus hydroelectric wholesale sales is reduced 
wholesale prices also vary to a greater extent each year based on wind patterns as wind generation facilities have grown significantly in the region 
the price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand  such as occurs with temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods 
the price of natural gas as fuel for natural gas fired electric generation also tends to increase during periods of high demand which are often related to temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase natural gas fuel in these periods of high prices to meet electric demands 
the cost of power supply during peak usage periods may be higher than the retail sales price or the amount allowed in retail rates by our regulators 
to the extent that power supply costs are above the amount allowed currently in retail rates  the difference is partially absorbed by the company in current expense and it is partially deferred or shared with customers through regulatory mechanisms 
therefore  the impact on our results of operations may be larger or smaller than the weather related impact on power supply cost 
as a result of these factors operating in combination  our net cost of power supply the difference between our costs of generation and market purchases  reduced by our revenue from wholesale sales varies significantly because of weather 
damages to facilities may be caused by severe weather  such as snow  ice or wind storms 
the cost to implement rapid repair to such facilities can be significant 
overhead electric lines are most susceptible to such severe weather 
collateral damage from utility assets that are damaged by external forces may result in third party claims against the company for property damage and or personal injuries 

table of contents avista corporation we are subject to commodity price risk 
a combination of factors exposes our operations to commodity price risks 
we rely on energy markets and other counterparties for energy supply  surplus and optimization transactions and commodity price hedging 
these factors include our obligation to serve our retail customers at rates set through the regulatory process 
we cannot change retail rates to reflect current energy prices unless and until we receive regulatory approval 
customer demand  which is beyond our control because of weather  customer choices  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
some of our energy supply cost is fixed by nature of the energy producing assets or through contractual arrangements 
however  a significant portion of our energy resource costs are not fixed 
because we must supply the amount of energy demanded by our customers and we must sell it at fixed rates and only a portion of our energy supply costs are fixed  we are subject to the risk of buying energy at higher prices in wholesale energy markets and the risk of selling energy at lower prices if we are in a surplus position 
electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets are commodities with historically high price volatility 
changes in wholesale energy prices affect  among other things  the cash requirements to purchase electricity and natural gas for retail customers or wholesale obligations and the market value of derivative assets and liabilities 
when we enter into fixed price energy commodity transactions for future delivery  we are subject to credit terms that may require us to provide collateral to wholesale counterparties related to the difference between current prices and the agreed upon fixed prices 
these collateral requirements can place significant demands on our cash flows or borrowing arrangements 
price volatility can cause collateral requirements to change quickly and significantly 
regulators may not grant rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of our costs or allow a reasonable rate of return for our shareholders 
we have experienced higher costs for utility operations in each of the last several years 
we have also made significant capital investments into utility plant assets 
our ability to recover these costs depends on the amount and timeliness of retail rate changes allowed by regulatory agencies 
we expect to periodically file for rate increases with regulatory agencies to recover our costs and provide an opportunity to earn a reasonable return for shareholders 
if regulators grant substantially lower rate increases than our requests in the future or if deferred costs are disallowed  it could have a negative effect on our operating revenues  net income and cash flows 
deferred power and natural gas costs are subject to regulatory review  costs higher than those recovered in retail rates reduce cash flows 
we defer income statement recognition and recovery from customers of certain power and natural gas costs that are higher than what is currently authorized in retail rates by regulators 
these power and natural gas costs are recorded as deferred charges with the opportunity for future recovery through retail rates 
these deferred costs are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators 
despite the opportunity to recover deferred power and natural gas costs  our operating cash flows are negatively affected until these costs are recovered from customers 
our energy resource management activities may cause volatility in our cash flows and results of operations 
we engage in active hedging and resource optimization practices  however  we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our energy resource assets or our forecasted net positions for various time horizons 
to reduce energy cost volatility and economic exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity and natural gas  as well as forecasted excess or deficit energy positions and inventories of natural gas 
we use physical energy contracts and derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps and options traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
we do not cover the entire market price volatility exposure for our forecasted net positions 
to the extent we have positions that are not hedged  or if hedging positions do not fully match the corresponding purchase or sale  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material effect on our operating revenues  resource costs  derivative assets and liabilities  and operating cash flows 
in addition  actual loads and resources typically vary from forecasts  sometimes to a significant degree  which requires additional transactions or dispatch decisions that impact cash flows 

table of contents avista corporation financial market conditions may impact our results of operations and our liquidity 
we have significant capital requirements that we expect to fund  in part  by accessing capital markets 
as such  the state of financial markets and credit availability in the global  united states and regional economies could have an impact on our operations 
we could experience increased borrowing costs or limited access to capital on reasonable terms 
we need to access long term capital markets to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or prohibit our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
performance of the financial markets could also result in significant declines in the market values of assets held by our pension plan and or a significant increase in the pension liability which impacts the funded status of the plan and could increase future funding obligations and pension expense 
we rely on access to credit from financial institutions for short term borrowings 
we need to maintain access to adequate levels of credit with financial institutions for short term liquidity 
we have a million committed line of credit  which is scheduled to expire in february we cannot guarantee that we will have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
the committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions 
in the event of default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
ecova has a million committed line of credit  which is scheduled to expire in april in accordance with the agreement  the amount of this credit facility will be reduced to million on september  and million on december  following the acquisition of lpb in january  this credit agreement is fully utilized 
ecova expects to expand this facility in however  we cannot guarantee that ecova will be able to expand this facility or have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
downgrades in our credit ratings could limit our ability to obtain financing  adversely affect the terms of financing and impact our ability to transact for or hedge energy resources 
if we do not maintain our investment grade credit rating with the major credit rating agencies  we could expect increased debt service costs  limitations on our ability to access capital markets or obtain other financing on reasonable terms  and requirements to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit to lenders and counterparties 
in addition  credit rating downgrades could reduce the number of counterparties willing to do business with us 
we are subject to various operational and event risks that are associated with the utility industry 
our utility operations are subject to operational and event risks that include blackouts or disruptions to distribution  transmission or transportation systems  forced outages at generating plants  fuel cost and availability  including delivery constraints  explosions  fires  accidents  or mechanical breakdowns that may occur while operating and maintaining our generation  transmission and distribution systems  and natural disasters that can disrupt energy generation  transmission and distribution 
as protection against operational and event risks  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses and we seek to negotiate indemnification arrangements with contractors for certain event risks 
however  insurance or indemnification agreements may not be adequate to protect us against liability from all of the operational and event risks described above 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that insurers and or other parties will dispute or be unable to perform on their obligations to us 
cyber security attacks  terrorism or other malicious acts could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents avista corporation in the course of our operations  we rely on interconnected information technology systems for operation of our generating plants  electric transmission and distribution systems  natural gas distribution  customer billing and customer service  accounting and other administrative processes and compliance with various regulations 
there are various risks associated with information technology systems such as hardware or software failure  communications failure  data distortion or destruction  unauthorized access to data  misuse of proprietary or confidential data  unauthorized control through electronic means  programming mistakes and other deliberate or inadvertent human errors 
in particular  cyber security attacks  terrorism or other malicious acts could damage  destroy or disrupt these systems 
any failure of information technology systems could result in a loss of operating revenues  an increase in operating expenses and costs to repair or replace damaged assets 
any of the above could also result in the loss or release of confidential customer information or other proprietary data that could adversely affect our reputation and result in costly litigation 
as these potential cyber security attacks become more common and sophisticated  we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems or obtain specific insurance coverage against potential losses 
we are currently the subject of several regulatory proceedings  and we are named in multiple lawsuits related to our participation in western energy markets 
through our utility operations and the prior operations of avista energy  we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and complaints related to energy markets in the western united states 
most of these proceedings and complaints relate to the significant increase in the spot market price of energy in and this allegedly contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices 
these proceedings and complaints include  but are not limited to refund proceedings in california and the pacific northwest  market conduct investigations by the ferc  and complaints filed by various parties related to alleged misconduct by parties in western power markets 
as a result of these proceedings and complaints  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds and damages from us  which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows

the ferc  the nerc and the wecc may perform periodic audits of the company 
failure to comply with the ferc  the nerc  or the wecc requirements can result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
future legislation or administrative rules could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
concerns over long term global climate changes may affect our operational and financial performance 
legislative developments and advocacy at the state  national and international levels about climate change and other environmental concerns may have significant impacts on our operations 
the electric utility industry is one of the largest and most immediate industries to be more heavily regulated in some proposals 
for example  various legislative proposals have been made to limit or place further restrictions on byproducts of combustion  including sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  carbon dioxide  and other greenhouse gases and mercury emissions 
such proposals  if adopted  could restrict the operation and raise the cost of our power generation resources 
we expect continuing activity in the future and we are evaluating the extent that potential changes to environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built or contracted with  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 

table of contents avista corporation we have contingent liabilities  including certain matters related to potential environmental liabilities  and cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in the normal course of our business  we have matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation  mediation  investigation and or negotiation

table of contents avista corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segments we have two reportable business segments as follows avista utilities an operating division of avista corp 
that comprises our regulated utility operations 
avista utilities generates  transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas 
the utility also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas 
ecova formerly known as advantage iq an indirect subsidiary of avista corp 
percent owned as of december  provides energy efficiency and cost management programs and services for multi site customers and utilities throughout north america 
ecova s primary product lines include expense management services for utility and telecom needs as well as strategic energy management and efficiency services that include procurement  conservation  performance reporting  financial planning and energy efficiency program management for commercial enterprises and utilities 
we have other businesses  including sheet metal fabrication  venture fund investments and real estate investments  spokane energy see note as well as certain other operations of avista capital 
these activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of avista corp  including am d  doing business as metalfx 
the following table presents net income loss attributable to avista corp 
for each of our business segments and the other businesses for the year ended december dollars in thousands avista utilities ecova other net income attributable to avista corporation executive level summary overall net income attributable to avista corporation was million for  an increase from million for this was primarily due to an increase in earnings at avista utilities primarily due to colder weather during the first quarter and the implementation of general rate increases  partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes and partially due to an increase in earnings at ecova  as well as a reduction in the net loss from the other businesses 
the first quarter of was significantly colder than the first quarter of and slightly colder than average 
the first quarter of was one of the warmest january to march periods on record in our service territory 
avista utilities avista utilities is our most significant business segment 
our utility financial performance is dependent upon  among other things weather conditions  regulatory decisions  allowing our utility to recover costs  including purchased power and fuel costs  on a timely basis  and to earn a reasonable return on investment  the price of natural gas in the wholesale market  including the effect on the price of fuel for generation  the price of electricity in the wholesale market  including the effects of weather conditions  natural gas prices and other factors affecting supply and demand  and the ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity securities  which can be affected by various factors including our credit ratings  interest rates and other capital market conditions 
in our utility operations  we regularly review the need for rate changes in each jurisdiction to improve the recovery of costs and capital investments in our generation  transmission and distribution systems 
general rate increases went into effect in idaho on october  and october   in washington effective december  and january   and in oregon effective march  and june  our utility net income was million for  an increase from million for earnings for were positively impacted by an increase in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher retail loads caused by colder weather during the first quarter and general rate increases 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased maintenance costs  pensions and other postretirement benefits expense  and labor costs 

table of contents avista corporation above normal snowpack last winter  and a cool and wet spring produced excellent river run off conditions in this resulted in one of the best hydroelectric generation years on record 
in addition  purchased power and natural gas fuel prices were below the level included in base rates 
as such  the company received a benefit of million and million was deferred for the future benefit of customers under the energy recovery mechanism in washington 
we are making significant capital investments in generation  transmission and distribution systems to preserve and enhance service reliability for our customers and replace aging infrastructure 
utility capital expenditures were million for we expect utility capital expenditures to be about million for each of and these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment see discussion under avista utilities capital expenditures 
ecova ecova had net income attributable to avista corporation of million for  an increase from million for this increase was primarily due to strong growth in energy management services  moderate growth from expense management  as well as the acquisition of the loyalton group loyalton effective december  ecova s earnings potential continues to be moderated by low short term interest rates  which limits interest revenue on funds held for clients 
on november   ecova acquired prenova  inc prenova  an atlanta based energy management company 
the cash paid for the acquisition of prenova of million was funded primarily through borrowings under ecova s committed credit agreement 
in january  ecova acquired lpb energy management lpb  a dallas based energy management company 
the cash paid for the acquisition of lpb of million was funded by ecova through million of borrowings under its committed credit agreement  a million equity infusion from existing shareholders including avista capital and the other owners of ecova  and available cash 
while we do not expect these acquisitions to have an impact on earnings  they increase ecova s market share and allow ecova to offer its clients a broader range of services leading to potential future earnings growth 
the acquisition of cadence network in july was funded with the issuance of ecova common stock 
under the transaction agreement  the previous owners of cadence network can exercise a right to have their shares of ecova common stock redeemed by ecova during july or july if ecova is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
these redemption rights were not exercised in july these redemption rights expire july  the redemption price would be determined based on the fair market value of ecova at the time of the redemption election as determined by certain independent parties 
as of december   there were redeemable noncontrolling interests of million related to these redemption rights 
should the previous owners of cadence network exercise their redemption rights  ecova will seek the necessary funding through its credit facility  a capital request from existing owners  an infusion of capital from potential new investors or a combination of these sources 
in january  avista capital purchased shares held by one of the previous owners of cadence network for million 
we may seek to monetize all or part of our investment in ecova in the future  regardless of whether ecova s minority owner redemption rights are exercised 
the value of a potential monetization depends on future market conditions  growth of the business and other factors 
this may provide access to public market capital and provide potential liquidity to avista corp 
and the other owners of ecova 
there can be no assurance that such a transaction will be completed 
other businesses the net loss for these operations was million for compared to a net loss of million for the improvement in results was due in part to increased earnings at metalfx and a decrease in the net loss on investments 
also  in  we recorded a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business 
liquidity and capital resources we need to access long term capital markets from time to time to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors  many of which  including market conditions  are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or eliminate our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
in february  we entered into a new committed line of credit with various financial institutions in the total amount of million with an expiration date of february that replaced our million and million committed lines of credit that had expiration dates in april in december  this committed line of credit was amended to extend the expiration date to february and improve the pricing terms 
as of december   there were million of cash borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
as of december   we had million of available liquidity under this line of credit 

table of contents avista corporation in december  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our million committed line of credit 
we expect to issue up to million of long term debt in in september  we cash settled interest rate swap contracts notional amount of million and paid a total of million 
the interest rate swap contracts were entered during the third quarter of and were settled in connection with the pricing of million of first mortgage bonds as described above 
upon settlement of the interest rate swaps  the regulatory asset included as part of long term debt is amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the forecasted interest payments 
in  we issued million of common stock  including million under a sales agency agreement 
we expect to issue up to million of common stock from time to time in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
we have million shares available to be issued under the sales agency agreement and we expect to expand this agreement for a significant portion of our common stock issuances 
after considering the issuances of long term debt and common stock during  we expect net cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available under our million committed line of credit agreement  to provide adequate resources to fund capital expenditures  dividends  and other contractual commitments 
avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
we will continue to file for rate adjustments to provide for recovery of operating costs and capital investments  and provide the opportunity to improve our earned returns as allowed by regulators 
with regards to the timing and plans for future filings  the assessment of our need for rate relief and the development of rate case plans takes into consideration short term and long term needs  as well as specific factors that can affect the timing of rate filings 
such factors include  but are not limited to  in service dates of major capital investments and the timing of changes in major revenue and expense items

the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on january  no capital structure ratios or cost of capital components were specified in the settlement agreement 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to not file a general rate case in washington prior to april  
table of contents avista corporation the settlement agreement also provides for the deferral of certain generation plant maintenance costs 
in order to address the variability in year to year maintenance costs  beginning in  we are deferring changes in maintenance costs related to our coyote spring natural gas fired generation plant and our percent ownership interest in units of the colstrip generation plant 
we compare actual  non fuel  maintenance expenses for the coyote springs and colstrip plants with the amount of baseline maintenance expenses used to establish base retail rates  and defer the difference 
the deferral will occur annually  with no carrying charge  with deferred costs being amortized over a four year period  beginning in the year following the period costs are deferred 
the amount of expense to be requested for recovery in future general rate cases would be the actual maintenance expense recorded in the test period  less any amount deferred during the test period  plus the amortization of previously deferred costs 
for  we deferred million of maintenance costs in washington 
idaho general rate cases in july  the ipuc approved a settlement agreement in our general rate cases that were filed with the ipuc in january the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on august  as agreed to in the settlement  base electric rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million

while our cash collections from customers are reduced by this amortization during the two year period  the mitigation plan has no impact on our net income 
retail rates increased on october  and will increase on october  as the previous deferred state income tax balance is amortized

base natural gas rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which is designed to increase annual revenues by million 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed not to file a general rate case seeking a change in base electric or natural gas rates effective prior to april  this does not preclude us from filing annual rate adjustments such as the pca and the pga 
the settlement agreement also provides for the deferral of certain generation plant operation and maintenance costs 
in order to address the variability in year to year operation and maintenance costs  beginning in  we are deferring changes in operation and maintenance costs related to the coyote spring natural gas fired generation plant and our percent ownership interest in units of the colstrip generation plant 
we compare actual  non fuel  operation and maintenance expenses for the coyote springs and colstrip plants with the amount of expenses authorized for recovery in base rates in the applicable deferral year  and defer the difference from that currently authorized 
the deferral will occur annually  with no carrying charge  with deferred costs being amortized over a three year period  beginning in the year following the period costs are deferred 
the amount of expense to be requested for recovery in future general rate cases will be the actual operation and maintenance expense recorded in the test period  less any amount deferred during the test period  plus the amortization of previously deferred costs

part of the rate increase became effective march   with the remaining increase effective june  an additional rate adjustment designed to increase revenues by million will occur on june  to recover capital costs associated with certain reinforcement and replacement projects upon a demonstration that such projects are complete and the costs were prudently incurred 

table of contents avista corporation proposed electric decoupling washington in the september washington general rate case settlement which was approved by the wutc in december  one party  the northwest energy coalition nwec  did not sign the agreement and is pursuing an electric decoupling mechanism in washington 
the issue of electric decoupling is being addressed through a separate procedural schedule 
decoupling separates the link between actual kwh sales and the recovery of our fixed costs 
in summary  the nwec proposes that actual fixed cost recovery per customer be compared to authorized fixed cost recovery per customer  and any difference be deferred for later surcharge or rebate to customers 
the wutc has established a procedural schedule that would provide for a decision in the second quarter of purchased gas adjustments effective october   natural gas rates increased percent in idaho 
effective november   natural gas rates increased percent in washington  while decreasing percent in oregon 
effective november   natural gas rates increased percent in washington and percent in idaho  while decreasing percent in oregon 
effective november   natural gas rates decreased percent in oregon  percent in washington and percent in idaho 
in oregon  we absorb gain or loss percent of the difference between actual and projected gas costs for supply that is not hedged 
total net deferred natural gas costs were a liability of million as of december   a decrease from million as of december  in february  we filed pga requests with the respective utility commissions to decrease natural gas rates percent in washington and percent in idaho effective march  pgas are designed to pass through changes in natural gas costs to our customers with no change in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs or net income 
power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms the energy recovery mechanism erm is an accounting method used to track certain differences between actual power supply costs  net of the margin on wholesale sales and sales of fuel  and the amount included in base retail rates for our washington customers 
in the washington general rate case settlement  the parties agreed that there would be no deferrals under the erm in deferrals under the erm resumed in total net deferred power costs under the erm were a liability of million as of december  the difference in net power supply costs under the erm primarily results from changes in short term wholesale market prices and sales and purchase volumes  the level of hydroelectric generation  the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices  and retail loads 
under the erm  we absorb the cost or receive the benefit from the initial amount of power supply costs in excess of or below the level in retail rates  which is referred to as the deadband 
the annual calendar year deadband amount is currently million 
we incur the cost of  or receive the benefit from  percent of this initial power supply cost variance 
we share annual power supply cost variances between million and million with customers 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are higher surcharge to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are lower rebate to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
to the extent that the annual power supply cost variance from the amount included in base rates exceeds million  there is percent customers percent company sharing of the cost variance 
the following is a summary of the erm annual power supply cost variability deferred for future surcharge or rebate to customers expense or benefit to the company million between million million between million million excess over million 
table of contents avista corporation under the erm  we make an annual filing on or before april of each year to provide the opportunity for the wutc staff and other interested parties to review the prudence of and audit the erm deferred power cost transactions for the prior calendar year 
the erm provides for a day review period for the filing  however  the period may be extended by agreement of the parties or by wutc order 
additionally  we must make a filing no sooner than june  to allow all interested parties the opportunity to review the erm  and make recommendations to the wutc related to the continuation  modification or elimination of the erm 
we have a power cost adjustment pca mechanism in idaho that allows us to modify electric rates on october of each year with ipuc approval 
under the pca mechanism  we defer percent of the difference between certain actual net power supply expenses and the amount included in base retail rates for our idaho customers 
the october rate adjustments recover or rebate power supply costs deferred during the preceding july june twelve month period 
total net power supply costs deferred under the pca mechanism were a regulatory liability of million as of december  compared to a regulatory asset of million as of december  natural gas safety regulations on february   president obama signed into law the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of mandating new regulations be created to address public safety concerns 
regulations include requiring automatic shut off valves on pipeline mains  increased installation of excess flow valves on gas service piping  increased high consequence area boundaries as well as to provide additional scrutiny on existing emergency preparedness plans  quality assurance plans and damage prevention programs and broader federal oversight including broader use of fines and penalties to pipeline operators are included in the act 
we are evaluating the act and cannot predict the impact the act may ultimately have on our operations 
in addition  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration issued an advisory bulletin in january to remind operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities of their responsibilities  under federal integrity management regulations  to perform detailed threat and risk analyses especially with regards to their pipelines maximum allowable operating pressures 
while we believe that we operate our pipeline systems in a safe manner  we cannot predict the impact of any future regulations or inspections on our natural gas system 
results of operations the following provides an overview of changes in our consolidated statements of income 
more detailed explanations are provided  particularly for operating revenues and operating expenses  in the business segment discussions avista utilities  ecova and the other businesses that follow this section 
compared to utility revenues increased million  after elimination of intracompany revenues of million in and million in including intracompany revenues  electric revenues increased million and natural gas revenues increased million 
retail electric revenues increased million due to general rate increases and an increase in volumes sold caused by colder weather during the first three months of compared to in addition  sales of fuel increased million reflecting lower usage of our thermal generating plants and sales of natural gas fuel not used in generation 
these increases in retail electric revenues and sales of fuel were partially offset by a decrease in wholesale electric revenues of million due to a decrease in wholesale prices and volumes 
retail natural gas revenues increased million due to an increase in volumes caused by colder weather and prices from rate increases  while wholesale natural gas revenues decreased million 
non utility revenues increased million to million primarily as a result of ecova s revenues increasing million primarily due to growth in expense management and energy management services  as well as the acquisition of loyalton effective december  revenues from our other businesses increased million excluding intercompany revenues primarily due to increased sales at metalfx 
utility resource costs decreased million  after elimination of intracompany resource costs of million in and million in including intracompany resource costs  electric resource costs increased million and natural gas resource costs increased million 
the increase in electric resource costs was primarily due to an increase in other fuel costs represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation as part of the resource optimization process and the amortization of deferred power supply costs  partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs due to lower thermal generation and power purchased due in part to higher hydroelectric generation 
the increase in natural gas resource costs was primarily due to an increase in natural gas purchased due to an increase in retail sales 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased maintenance expenses including planned major maintenance at colstrip  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and labor 
utility depreciation and amortization increased million driven by additions to utility plant 
utility taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily reflecting higher retail revenue related taxes  as well as increased property taxes 

table of contents avista corporation non utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to an increase of million for ecova reflecting increased costs necessary for business growth and the acquisition of loyalton 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to refinancing transactions completed in december that lowered our effective rate on long term debt 
this was partially offset by higher interest rates on short term borrowings 
capitalized interest increased million due to higher average construction work in progress balances and higher borrowing rates including an increase on short term borrowing rates used in the calculation 
other expense net decreased million primarily due to a decrease in donations  a decrease in losses on investments including a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business recorded in  partially offset by a decrease in equity related afudc 
income taxes increased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for this increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes 
adjustments associated with reconciling the federal income tax return to the amount included in the financial statements for and prior year income tax return amendments decreased income tax expense by million for compared to utility revenues increased million due to increased electric revenues of million  partially offset by decreased natural gas revenues of million and intracompany revenues of million 
wholesale electric revenues increased million primarily due to an increase in volumes sold and partially due to an increase in wholesale prices and sales of fuel increased million reflecting increased thermal generation resource optimization 
these increases in electric revenues were partially offset by a decrease in retail electric revenues of million  due to a decrease in volumes sold and prices resulting from the elimination of the erm surcharge in february  offset by general rate increases 
retail natural gas revenues decreased million due to decreased retail rates and decreased volumes  while wholesale natural gas revenues increased million due to increased volumes and wholesale prices 
non utility revenues increased million to million primarily as a result of ecova s revenues increasing million primarily due to the acquisition of ecos in the third quarter of  as well as moderate growth in expense management and energy management services 
utility resource costs decreased million as natural gas resource costs decreased million and intracompany resource costs decreased million  while electric resource costs increased million 
the decrease in natural gas resource costs primarily reflects the purchased gas cost adjustments implemented in the fourth quarter of the increase in electric resource costs was primarily due to an increase in fuel costs due to an increase in thermal generation and other fuel costs represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation as part of the resource optimization process 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased outside services primarily consulting costs of million  compensation costs of million  as well as injuries and damages of million 
utility depreciation and amortization increased million driven by additions to utility plant 
utility taxes other than income taxes decreased million primarily reflecting lower retail revenue related taxes  partially offset by increased property taxes 
other non utility operating expenses increased million reflecting an increase of million for ecova due to the acquisition of ecos in the third quarter of  as well as moderate growth in expense management and energy management services 
the increase was partially offset by decreased operating expenses from the other businesses primarily due to the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant 
the majority of the rights and obligations for this agreement were conveyed to shell energy through the end of these rights and obligations were conveyed to avista utilities operations in january interest expense increased million primarily due to the consolidation of spokane energy increased interest expense million and the issuance of million of long term debt in september during  we carried relatively high balances on our committed line of credit at relatively low interest rates 
this was replaced with long term debt at a higher interest rate 

table of contents avista corporation interest expense to affiliated trusts decreased million because of the redemption of million of long term debt to affiliated trusts in april and a decrease in the variable interest rate on the remaining debt outstanding 
other expense net increased million primarily due to an increase in donations  a decrease in interest income primarily interest on regulatory deferrals due to lower balances and a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business 
income taxes increased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for this increase was due in part to an increase in income before income taxes 
adjustments associated with reconciling the federal income tax return to the amount included in the financial statements for and prior year income tax return amendments decreased income tax expense by million for recorded in the third quarter 
in  we recorded adjustments related to internal revenue service irs audits and adjustments for the filed federal tax return that had a favorable impact to income tax expense of million avista utilities for recorded in the third quarter 
avista utilities compared to net income for avista utilities was million for  an increase from million for avista utilities income from operations was million for compared to million for the increase in net income and income from operations was primarily due to an increase in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs  partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in net income from avista utilities was also due to a decrease in interest expense net of capitalized interest and a decrease in donations included in other expenses 
the following table presents our operating revenues  resource costs and resulting gross margin for the year ended december dollars in thousands electric natural gas intracompany total operating revenues resource costs gross margin avista utilities operating revenues increased million and resource costs decreased million  which resulted in an increase of million in gross margin 
the gross margin on electric sales increased million and the gross margin on natural gas sales increased million 
the increase in electric gross margin was due to colder weather during the first quarter of that increased retail loads and general rate increases 
for  we recognized a benefit of million under the erm in washington 
as part of a rate case settlement there were no deferrals under the erm in for  power supply costs were million below the level included in base retail rates in washington 
the increase in our natural gas gross margin was primarily due to colder weather that increased retail loads particularly in the first quarter and partially due to general rate increases 
intracompany revenues and resource costs represent purchases and sales of natural gas between our natural gas distribution operations and our electric generation operations as fuel for our generation plants 
these transactions are eliminated in the presentation of avista utilities total results and in the consolidated financial statements

the increase in revenue per mwh was primarily due to the washington and idaho general rate increases 
wholesale electric revenues decreased million due to a decrease in sales prices decreased revenues million and a decrease in sales volumes decreased revenues million 
the decrease in sales volumes was primarily due to decreased wholesale power optimization and higher than expected retail sales caused by colder weather in the first quarter 
when electric wholesale market prices are below the cost of operating our natural gas fired thermal generating units  we sell the natural gas purchased for generation in the wholesale market rather than operate the generating units 
the revenues from sales of fuel increased million due to an increase in sales of natural gas fuel as part of thermal generation resource optimization activities and lower usage of our thermal generation plants in as compared to this was due in part to increased hydroelectric generation

in  ecova managed bills totaling billion  an increase of billion as compared to compared to ecova s net income attributable to avista corporation was million for compared to million for operating revenues increased million and operating expenses increased million 
the increase in net income attributable to avista corporation  operating revenues and expenses was primarily due to the third quarter acquisition of ecos  as well as moderate growth in expense management and energy management services 
the increase in operating expenses was also due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of ecos 
as of december   ecova had expense management customers representing  billed sites in north america 
the decrease in billed sites at year end as compared to year end billed sites of  was due to the loss of a customer that had a significant number of billed sites  but represented only approximately percent of annual revenues

accounting standards to be adopted in at this time  we are not expecting the adoption of accounting standards to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in for information on accounting standards adopted in and earlier periods  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
the following accounting policies represent those that our management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements that require the use of estimates and assumptions avista utilities operating revenues operating revenues for our utility business related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to our customers 
the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  we estimate the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated and recorded 
our estimate of unbilled revenue is based on the number of customers  current rates  meter reading dates  actual native load for electricity  and actual throughput for natural gas 
any difference between actual and estimated revenue is automatically corrected in the following month when the actual meter reading and customer billing occurs 
regulatory accounting we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
this requires that certain costs and or obligations such as incurred power and natural gas costs not currently recovered through rates  but expected to be recovered in the future be reflected as deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in our consolidated statements of income until the period during which matching revenues are recognized 
we expect to recover our regulatory assets through future rates 
our regulatory assets are subject to review for prudence and recoverability 
as such  certain deferred costs may be disallowed by our regulators 
if at some point in the future we determine that we no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting for all or a portion of our regulated operations  we could be required to write off regulatory assets  and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates when such costs are incurred  even if we expect to recover such costs in the future 
utility energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities our utility enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of energy at a specified time  or during a specified period  in the future 
these contracts are entered into as part of our management of loads and resources and certain contracts are considered derivative instruments 
the wutc and the ipuc issued accounting orders authorizing us to offset commodity derivative assets or liabilities with a regulatory asset or liability 
this accounting treatment is intended to defer the recognition of mark to market gains and losses on energy commodity transactions until the period of settlement 
the orders provide for us to not recognize the unrealized gain or loss on utility derivative commodity instruments in the consolidated statements of income 
realized gains or losses are recognized in the period of settlement  subject to approval for recovery through retail rates 
realized gains and losses  subject to regulatory approval  result in adjustments to retail rates through purchased gas cost adjustments  the erm in washington  the pca mechanism in idaho  and periodic general rates cases 
we use quoted market prices and forward price curves to estimate the fair value of our utility derivative commodity instruments 
as such  the fair value of utility derivative commodity instruments recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 

table of contents avista corporation pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all regular full time employees at avista utilities 
our finance committee of the board of directors establishes investment policies  objectives and strategies that seek an appropriate return for the pension plan  and reviews and approves changes to the investment and funding policies 
we have contracted with an investment consultant who is responsible for managing monitoring the individual investment managers 
the investment managers performance and related individual fund performance is reviewed at least quarterly by an internal benefits committee and by the finance committee to monitor compliance with our established investment policy objectives and strategies 
our pension plan assets are invested primarily in marketable debt and equity securities 
pension plan assets may also be invested in real estate  absolute return  venture capital private equity and commodity funds 
in seeking to obtain the desired return to fund the pension plan  the investment consultant recommends allocation percentages by asset classes 
these recommendations are reviewed by the internal benefits committee  which then recommends their adoption by the finance committee 
the finance committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have a supplemental executive retirement plan serp that provides additional pension benefits to our executive officers whose benefits under the pension plan are reduced due to the application of section of the internal revenue code of and the deferral of salary under deferred compensation plans 
pension costs including the serp were million in  million for and million for of our pension costs  approximately percent are expensed and percent are capitalized consistent with labor charges 
the costs related to the serp are expensed 
our costs for the pension plan are determined in part by actuarial formulas that are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs are affected by employee demographics including age  compensation and length of service by employees  the amount of cash contributions we make to the pension plan  and the return on pension plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of our pension plan may also affect current and future pension costs 
pension plan costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on pension plan assets  discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
the change in pension plan obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in our consolidated statement of income  but we generally recognize the change in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
as such  our costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to pension plan participants 
we have not made any changes to pension plan provisions in  and that have had any significant effect on our recorded pension plan amounts 
we have revised the key assumption of the discount rate in  and such changes had an effect on our pension costs in  and and may affect future years  given the cost recognition approach described above 
however  in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  our assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to our future pension costs and funding requirements 
in selecting a discount rate  we consider yield rates for highly rated corporate bond portfolios with maturities similar to that of the expected term of pension benefits 
in  we decreased the pension plan discount rate to percent from percent in we used a discount rate of percent in this increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million in and million in 
table of contents avista corporation the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by our plan 
we used an expected long term rate of return of percent in  percent in and percent in this increased pension costs by approximately million in and by approximately million in the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million or percent for  a gain of million or percent for and a gain of million or percent for we periodically analyze the estimated long term rate of return on assets based upon revisions to the investment portfolio 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage dollars in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption effect on projected benefit obligation effect on pension cost expected long term return on plan assets expected long term return on plan assets discount rate discount rate changes in the expected return on plan assets would not have an effect on our total pension liability 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of our retired employees 
we accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit obligations during the years that employees provide service 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our postretirement plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
contingencies we have unresolved regulatory  legal and tax issues for which there is inherent uncertainty for the ultimate outcome of the respective matter 
we accrue a loss contingency if it is probable that an asset is impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or impairment can be reasonably estimated 
we also disclose losses that do not meet these conditions for accrual  if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
for all material contingencies  we have made a judgment as to the probability of a loss occurring and as to whether or not the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss recognition criteria are met  liabilities are accrued or assets are reduced 
however  no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency

overall liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of avista utilities 
the primary source of operating cash flows for our utility operations is revenues from sales of electricity and natural gas 
significant uses of cash flows from our utility operations include the purchase of power  fuel and natural gas  and payment of other operating expenses  taxes and interest  with any excess being available for other corporate uses such as capital expenditures and dividends 
we design operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and to direct capital expenditures to choices that support immediate and long term strategies  particularly for our regulated utility operations 
in addition to operating expenses  we have continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of utility facilities 
over time  our operating cash flows usually do not fully support the amount required for utility capital expenditures 
as such  from time to time  we need to access long term capital markets in order to fund these needs as well as fund maturing debt 
see further discussion at capital resources 

table of contents avista corporation we periodically file for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to improve our earned returns as allowed by regulators 
see further details in the section avista utilities regulatory matters 
for our utility operations  when power and natural gas costs exceed the levels currently recovered from retail customers  net cash flows are negatively affected 
factors that could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to exceed the levels currently recovered from our customers include  but are not limited to  higher prices in wholesale markets when we buy energy or an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets 
factors beyond our control that could result in an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets include  but are not limited to increases in demand either due to weather or customer growth  low availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  unplanned outages at generating facilities  and failure of third parties to deliver on energy or capacity contracts 
we monitor the potential liquidity impacts of increasing energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs for our utility operations 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet the increased cash needs of potentially higher energy commodity prices and increased other operating costs through our million committed line of credit 
as of december   we had million of available liquidity under our committed line of credit 
with our million credit facility that expires in february  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for the next months 
our utility has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of power and natural gas supply costs 
however  if prices rise above the level currently allowed in retail rates in periods when we are buying energy  deferral balances would increase  negatively affecting our cash flow and liquidity until such time as these costs  with interest  are recovered from customers 
credit and nonperformance risk our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities can require collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit 
as of december   we had cash deposited as collateral of million and letters of credit of million outstanding related to our energy derivative contracts 
price movements and or a downgrade in our credit ratings may impact further the amount of collateral required 
see credit ratings for further information 
for example  in addition to limiting our ability to conduct transactions  if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices decreased by percent in the first year and percent in subsequent years  we estimate  based on our positions outstanding at december   that we would potentially be required to post additional collateral of up to million 
the additional collateral amount is higher than the amount disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements because this analysis includes contracts that are not considered derivatives and due to the assumptions about potential energy price changes 
under the terms of interest rate swap agreements that we enter into periodically  we may be required to post cash or letters of credit as collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the instrument 
this has not historically been significant to our liquidity position 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount totaling million and we had posted collateral of million million in cash and million in the form of a letter of credit 
if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade based on our interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   we would potentially be required to post additional collateral of up to million 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was enacted into law in july the dodd frank act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the securities and exchange commission sec for certain swaps which include a variety of derivative instruments and the users of such swaps  that previously had been largely exempted from regulation 
a variety of rules must be adopted by federal agencies including the cftc  sec and the ferc to implement the dodd frank act 
these rules being developed and implemented will clarify the impact of the dodd frank act on avista corp  which may be significant 

table of contents avista corporation under the dodd frank act  swap dealers and major swap participants generally will be required to collect minimum initial and variation margin from their counterparties for non cleared swaps 
however the requirement varies with the type of counterparty and the regulator of the major swap participant or swap dealer 
avista corp 
should be categorized as a counterparty that is a non financial end user for the purposes of the dodd frank act  ie  as a non financial entity that engages in derivatives to hedge commercial risk 
under a proposed rule issued by the cftc  swap dealers and major swap participants subject to regulation by the cftc would not be required to collect initial or variation margin from counterparties that are non financial end users 
the sec has not yet issued a proposed rule with respect to security based swap dealers or security based major swap participants 
however  notwithstanding levels of margin required by regulation or the lack thereof  concern remains that swap dealer and major swap participant counterparties will pass along their increased capital and interdealer margin costs through higher prices and reductions in thresholds for posting 
the dodd frank act also requires certain swaps to be cleared and traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities 
such clearing requirements would result in a significant change from our current practice of bilaterally negotiated credit terms 
an exemption to mandatory clearing is available under the dodd frank act for counterparties that are non financial end users using swaps to hedge commercial risk 
however  the cost of entering into a non cleared swap that is available as a cleared swap may be greater and margin levels are expected to be higher 
we will continue to monitor developments including certain proposals to delay various implementation steps defined in the act 
we cannot predict the impact the dodd frank act may ultimately have on our operations 
capital resources our consolidated capital structure  including the current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings  and excluding noncontrolling interests  consisted of the following as of december  and dollars in thousands december  december  amount percent of total amount percent of total current portion of long term debt current portion of nonrecourse long term debt short term borrowings long term debt to affiliated trusts nonrecourse long term debt long term debt total debt total avista corporation stockholders equity total we need to finance capital expenditures and acquire additional funds for operations from time to time 
the cash requirements needed to service our indebtedness  both short term and long term  reduces the amount of cash flow available to fund capital expenditures  purchased power  fuel and natural gas costs  dividends and other requirements 
our stockholders equity increased million during primarily due to net income and the issuance of common stock  partially offset by dividends 
we generally fund capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates depending on a variety of factors 
cash provided by our utility operating activities  as well as issuances of long term debt and common stock  are expected to be the primary source of funds for operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures for borrowings under our million committed line of credit will supplement these funds to the extent necessary 
we are planning to issue up to million of common stock in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
in  we issued million of common stock  including million under a sales agency agreement 
as of december   we had million shares available to be issued under this agreement and we expect to expand this agreement for a significant portion of our common stock issuances 
in december  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our million committed line of credit 
we expect to issue up to million of long term debt in in february  we entered into a new committed line of credit with various financial institutions in the total amount of million with an expiration date of february that replaced our million and million committed lines of credit that had expiration dates in april in december  this committed line of credit was amended to extend the expiration date to february and improve the pricing terms 
our committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions  including a covenant which does not permit our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization to be greater than percent at any time 
as of december   we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of percent 

table of contents avista corporation balances outstanding and interest rates of borrowings excluding letters of credit under our committed lines of credit were as follows as of and for the years ended december dollars in thousands balance outstanding at end of year letters of credit outstanding at end of year maximum balance outstanding during the year average balance outstanding during the year average interest rate during the year average interest rate at end of year any default on the line of credit or other financing arrangements of avista corp 
or any of our significant subsidiaries could result in cross defaults to other agreements of such entity  and or to the line of credit or other financing arrangements of any other of such entities 
any defaults could also induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral 
in the event of any such default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
avista corp 
does not guarantee the indebtedness of any of its subsidiaries 
as of december   avista corp 
and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the covenants of their financing agreements 
as part of its cash management practices and operations  ecova and avista corp 
entered into a master promissory note in january  where ecova will from time to time make unsecured short term loans to avista corp 
the master promissory note limits the total outstanding indebtedness to no more than million in principal 
additionally  such loans are required to be repaid on the last business day of each quarter march  june  september and december and sooner upon demand by ecova 
amounts are loaned at a rate consistent with avista corp 
s credit facility 
we are restricted under our restated articles of incorporation as to the additional preferred stock we can issue 
as of december   we could issue million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of percent 
we are not planning to issue preferred stock 
under the mortgage and deed of trust securing our first mortgage bonds including secured medium term notes  we may issue additional first mortgage bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of percent of the cost or fair value whichever is lower of property additions which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or an equal principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or deposit of cash 
however  we may not issue any additional first mortgage bonds with certain exceptions in the case of bonds issued on the basis of retired bonds unless our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any period of consecutive calendar months out of the preceding calendar months were at least twice the annual interest requirements on all mortgage securities at the time outstanding  including the first mortgage bonds to be issued  and on all indebtedness of prior rank 
as of december   our property additions and retired bonds would have allowed us to issue million in aggregate principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds 
we believe that we have adequate capacity to issue first mortgage bonds to meet our financing needs over the next several years 
avista utilities capital expenditures capital expenditures for our utility were million for the years through we expect utility capital expenditures to be about million for each of  and our capital budget for includes the following dollars in millions transmission and distribution information technology customer growth generation natural gas facilities environmental other total 
table of contents avista corporation these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment 
actual capital expenditures may vary from our estimates due to factors such as changes in business conditions  construction schedules and environmental requirements 
future generation resource decisions may be further impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and renewable energy requirements as discussed at environmental issues and other contingencies 
ecova credit agreement in april  ecova entered into a new million three year committed line of credit agreement with a financial institution that replaced its million committed credit agreement that had an expiration date of may in december  the amount of this committed line of credit was increased to million  which is scheduled to decrease to million on september  and million on december  ecova expects to expand this facility in the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of ecova s assets 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under ecova s credit agreement as of december  the proceeds from these borrowings were used to fund the acquisition of prenova in november ecova borrowed million under this committed line of credit to fund a portion of the acquisition of lpb in january ecova redeemable stock in  ecova amended its employee stock incentive plan to provide an annual window at which time holders of common stock can put their shares back to ecova providing the shares are held for a minimum of six months 
stock is reacquired at fair market value at the date of reacquisition 
as the repurchase feature is at the discretion of the minority shareholders and option holders  there were redeemable noncontrolling interests of million as of december  for the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding  as well as outstanding redeemable stock 
in  the ecova employee stock incentive plan was amended such that  on a prospective basis  not all options granted under the plan have the put right 
additionally  there were redeemable noncontrolling interests of million related to the cadence network acquisition  as the previous owners can exercise a right to put their stock back to ecova in july or july if ecova is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
these redemption rights were not exercised in july these redemption rights expire july  should the previous owners of cadence network exercise their redemption rights  ecova will seek the necessary funding through its credit facility  a capital request from existing owners  an infusion of capital from potential new investors or a combination of these sources 
in january  avista capital purchased shares held by one of the previous owners of cadence network for million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under our million committed line of credit  an increase from million as of december  pension plan as of december   our pension plan had assets with a fair value that was less than the benefit obligation under the plan 
the pension plan funding deficit increased in primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate as well as market returns on assets that were lower than the expected long term return on plan assets 
we contributed million to the pension plan in we expect to contribute a total of million or million per year to the pension plan in the period through the final determination of pension plan contributions for future periods is subject to multiple variables  most of which are beyond our control  including further changes to the fair value of pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular the discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation 
credit ratings our access to capital markets and our cost of capital are directly affected by our credit ratings 
in addition  many of our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities contain terms dependent upon our credit ratings 
see credit and nonperformance risk and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of february  standard poor s moody s corporate issuer rating bbb baa senior secured debt a a senior unsecured debt bbb baa standard poor s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is bbb 
moody s lowest level of investment grade credit rating is baa 
table of contents avista corporation a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
each security rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be considered in the context of the applicable methodology  independent of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of avista corporation and charge us fees for their services 
dividends the board of directors considers the level of dividends on our common stock on a regular basis  taking into account numerous factors including  without limitation our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  the success of our business strategies  and general economic and competitive conditions 
our net income available for dividends is primarily derived from our regulated utility operations 
the payment of dividends on common stock is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to preferred stock when outstanding contained in our restated articles of incorporation  as amended 
in february  avista corp 
s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s common stock 
this was an increase of per share  or percent from the previous quarterly dividend of per share 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our future contractual obligations as of december  dollars in millions thereafter avista utilities long term debt maturities long term debt to affiliated trusts interest payments on long term debt short term borrowings energy purchase contracts public utility district contracts operating lease obligations other obligations information services contracts pension plan funding spokane energy nonrecourse long term debt maturities interest payments on nonrecourse long term debt avista capital consolidated redeemable noncontrolling interests short term borrowings venture funds investments operating lease obligations total contractual obligations represents our estimate of interest payments on long term debt  which is calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
interest on variable rate debt is calculated using the rate in effect at december  energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of the obligation to serve our retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements 
as a result  costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
includes the interest component of the lease obligation 
future capital lease obligations are not material 
represents operational agreements  settlements and other contractual obligations for our generation  transmission and distribution facilities 
these costs are generally recovered through base retail rates 
represents our estimated cash contributions to the pension plan through we cannot reasonably estimate pension plan contributions beyond at this time 

table of contents avista corporation under the transaction agreement  the previous owners of cadence network can exercise a right to have their shares of ecova common stock redeemed by ecova during july or july if ecova is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
these redemption rights were not exercised in july these redemption rights expire july  the redemption price would be determined based on the fair market value of ecova at the time of the redemption election as determined by certain independent parties 
in addition  certain shares acquired under ecova s employee stock incentive plan are redeemable at the option of the shareholder 
represents a commitment to fund a limited partnership venture fund commitment made by a subsidiary of avista capital 
these contractual obligations do not include income tax payments 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we will incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures in future periods for which we are not contractually obligated as part of our normal business operations 
competition our utility electric and natural gas distribution business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses and capital investments  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on investment as allowed by our regulators 
in retail markets  we compete with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to our service territories in the provision of service to new electric customers 
alternate providers of energy may also compete with us for sales to existing customers 
similarly  our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources including heating oil  propane and other fuels 
certain natural gas customers could by pass our natural gas system  reducing both revenues and recovery of fixed costs 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  we price natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and have varying degrees of flexibility to price transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
these individual contracts are subject to state regulatory review and approval 
we have long term transportation contracts with several of our largest industrial customers under which the customer assumes the risk of acquiring their own commodity while using our infrastructure for delivery 
such contracts reduce the risk of these customers by passing our system in the foreseeable future and minimizes the impact on our earnings 
also  non utility businesses are developing new technologies and services to help energy consumers manage energy in new ways that may improve productivity and could alter demand for the energy we sell 
in wholesale markets  competition for available electric supply is influenced by the localized and system wide demand for energy  type  capacity  location and availability of generation resources  and variety and circumstances of market participants 
these wholesale markets are regulated by the ferc  which requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services  and transparently price and offer transmission services without favor to any party  including the merchant functions of the utility 
participants in the wholesale energy markets include other utilities  federal power marketing agencies  energy marketing and trading companies  independent power producers  financial institutions  and commodity brokers 
ecova is subject to competition for service to existing customers and as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies may mean challenges for ecova to be the first to market a new product or service to gain an advantage in market share 
other challenges for ecova include the availability of funding and resources to meet capital needs  and rapidly advancing technologies which require continual product enhancement to avoid obsolescence 

table of contents avista corporation economic conditions and utility load growth the general economic data  on both national and local levels  contained in this section is based  in part  on independent government and industry publications  reports by market research firms or other independent sources 
while we believe that these publications and other sources are reliable  we have not independently verified such data and can make no representation as to its accuracy 
economic growth in the region we serve has slowed significantly since it peaked five years ago  yet we continue to experience customer growth 
we have three distinct metropolitan areas in our service area spokane  washington  coeur d alene  idaho and medford  oregon  and we are tracking three separate economic indicators which impact our business employment change  unemployment rates and foreclosure rates 
we have observed mixed results during the economic downturn 
the december employment indicators are negative except for medford  unemployment rates are lower in all three areas and foreclosure rates have decreased compared to early periods 
compared to the us the economy in our service area is broadly weaker than the national average 
we expect the economy in our service area to underperform compared to the us in employment in our eastern washington and northern idaho service area recently has reversed the gains seen early in  but our southwestern oregon service area has stabilized 
non farm employment growth for was percent in medford  oregon with large gains in hospitality  health services and retail trade offset by large declines in government 
we observed employment declines of percent in the spokane area with losses in professional services and government  partially offset by gains in manufacturing 
employment declined by percent in coeur d alene  idaho largely due to government job reductions 
the us nonfarm sector jobs grew by percent in the same twelve month period 
the unemployment rate went down in december from the year earlier level in spokane  medford  and coeur d alene 
the spokane rate was percent in december but declined to percent in december medford declined from percent to percent while coeur d alene went from percent to percent 
the us rate declined from percent to percent in the same period 
the housing market in our service area has improved when measured by foreclosure rates  with two of our three metropolitan areas better than the national average 
the december national rate was percent with a higher than national average level at percent in jackson county  oregon 
the spokane housing market was percent and kootenai county  idaho was percent and both were less than half the levels experienced a year ago 
based on our forecast for electric customer growth to average to percent per year and natural gas customer growth to average to percent within our service area  we anticipate retail electric and natural gas load growth will average between and percent annually for the four year period we anticipate customer and load growth at the lower end of the range in and an economic recovery and modest recovery trend growth as the economy strengthens during the four year period 
while the number of electric and natural gas customers is growing  the average annual usage by each residential customer has not changed significantly 
electric and natural gas sales growth have slowed as retail prices have increased relative to historical prices and company sponsored conservation programs have intensified 
population increases and business growth in our three state service territory remains above the national average 
natural gas loads for space heating vary significantly with annual fluctuations in weather within our service territories 
the forward looking statements set forth above regarding retail load growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail load growth are also based upon various assumptions  including assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns  internal business plans  and an assumption that we will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in actual experience can vary significantly from our projections 
environmental issues and other contingencies we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which we have ownership interests are designed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws 
furthermore  we conduct periodic reviews and audits of pertinent facilities and operations to ensure compliance and to respond to or anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has a committee to oversee environmental issues 

table of contents avista corporation we monitor legislative and regulatory developments at all levels of government for environmental issues  particularly those with the potential to impact the operation and productivity of our generating plants and other assets 
environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built or contracted with  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in increases to capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we intend to seek recovery of any such costs through the ratemaking process 
climate change and greenhouse gas emission reduction initiatives concerns about long term global climate changes could have a significant effect on our business 
our operations could also be affected by changes in laws and regulations intended to mitigate the risk of or alter global climate changes  including restrictions on the operation of our power generation resources and obligations imposed on the sale of natural gas 
changing temperatures and precipitation  including snowpack conditions  affect the availability and timing of streamflows  which impact hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages and maintenance costs 
changing temperatures could also increase or decrease customer demand 
greenhouse gas ghg emission standards could result in significant compliance costs 
such standards could also preclude us from developing  operating or contracting with certain types of generating plants 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of international  national  regional  or state ghg emission legislation and regulations 
as the us congress has not enacted any comprehensive climate change legislation  for the foreseeable future climate change regulations are expected to emerge from the epa and from individual states 
in particular  climate change legislation was passed in the state of washington  which includes a bill establishing ghg emissions reduction targets and another requiring that regulated sources report ghg emission from facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghgs per year 
although we are actively monitoring developments for climate change policies and restrictions on ghg emissions  it is important to note that we have relatively low ghg emissions as compared to other investor owned utilities in the us with percent of our electric generation resource mix derived from renewable sources including hydroelectric  biomass and contracts with wind generation projects and a majority of our thermal generation fueled with natural gas  plus a commitment to energy efficiency  we are among the lowest carbon emitting utilities in the nation 
our climate policy council an interdisciplinary team of management and other employees works to facilitate internal and external communications regarding climate change issues  analyze policy impacts  anticipate opportunities and evaluate strategies for avista corp  and develop recommendations on climate related policy positions and action plans 
national legislation climate change legislation has been proposed in the us congress  however  recent actions in the us congress indicate that climate change legislation is unlikely at this time 
we continue to monitor the situation for new developments that could affect our business 

table of contents avista corporation recent epa initiatives related to climate change after a public comment and review period  in december  the epa issued an endangerment finding regarding ghg emissions from motor vehicles under section a of clean air act caa 
specifically  the epa found that the combined emissions of ghg from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the ghg pollution which threatens public health and welfare 
the epa s findings are currently being challenged in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
on april   the epa and the department of transportation s national highway safety administration announced a joint final rule establishing ghg emission standards for mobile sources 
the ghg emission standards for mobile sources became effective on january  the epa has concluded that the caa requires the agency to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources through its preconstruction and operating permit programs on the date when epa regulations require any source mobile or stationary to meet ghg emission limits 
in may  the epa finalized a rule establishing an applicability threshold for regulating ghg emissions from stationary sources through the preconstruction and operating permit programs 
the epa issued a series of rules on december  to narrow the caa permitting requirement so that facilities with ghg emissions below the levels set in the tailoring rule do not need permits  as well as to give the epa authority to issue ghg permits in states that need to revise their permitting regulations to cover ghg emissions 
on january   rules took effect requiring that permits issued under the caa for new large stationary sources begin to address ghg emissions  as well as require best available control technology bact to control these emissions 
on july   the epa finalized a rule that defers  for a period of three years  the ghg permitting requirements for carbon dioxide for utilities  boilers and other industrial facilities using biomass 
the epa s final decision to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources and to establish applicability thresholds for ghgs has been challenged in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the epa is planning to issue regulations controlling ghg emissions from electric generating units 
according to a previously announced schedule  the epa was to propose standards for natural gas  oil and coal fired electric generating units by september   and issue final standards by may  the epa recently announced that it would not meet this schedule and has not yet provided a new schedule 
the epa had agreed to the original schedule as part of a settlement  as modified  with several states  local governments and environmental organizations that sued the epa over its failure to update emissions standards for power plants and refineries as required by section of the caa 
section requires the epa to issue new source performance standards that set emissions limits for new facilities and  under certain circumstances  address emissions from existing facilities 
these rules could significantly impact the costs of modifying existing thermal plants as well as building new thermal generation sources 
we cannot determine or estimate the costs of compliance with such measures at this time 
in september  the epa finalized the mandatory reporting rule mrr that requires facilities emitting over  metric tons of ghg a year to report their emissions to the epa beginning in january for emissions on march   the epa issued a rule extending the deadline for reporting ghg emissions data to september  based on rule applicability criteria  colstrip  coyote springs  and the rathdrum ct recently reported ghgs to the epa 
the rule also required that natural gas distribution system throughput be reported along with the development of a ghg monitoring plan 
on march   the epa proposed to further amend its reporting rule to include several new source categories  including reporting of ghg fugitive emissions from electric power transmission and distribution systems  fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution systems  and fugitive emissions from natural gas storage facilities 
reporting for these additional sources for emissions is required by march  state activities the states of washington and oregon have statutory targets to reduce ghg emissions 
washington s targets are intended to reduce ghg emission to levels by  to percent below levels by  and to percent below levels by oregon s targets would reduce ghg emissions to percent below levels by and percent below levels by both states enacted their targets expecting that they would be met through a combination of renewable energy standards  and assorted complementary policies  such as land use policies  energy efficiency codes for buildings  renewable fuel standards and vehicle emission standards 
however  neither state has adopted any comprehensive requirements aimed at achieving these targets 
in  the governor of washington issued an executive order directing the washington department of ecology to estimate ghg emissions by sector and source and to identify potential reduction requirements for them in preparation for the eventual imposition of state and or federal ghg regulations 
the department of ecology has identified facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghg annually and has forecasted that those facilities will need to reduce their emissions by percent in order for the state to achieve its ghg emissions reduction target for our natural gas distribution system has been specifically identified as a facility along with our thermal plants and contracts with thermal plants 
fossil fueled generation outside of the state has also been generically identified as a facility for the purposes of potentially regulating ghg emissions associated with the importation of power to serve our washington loads 
the state of washington has yet to identify how it might impose or enforce ghg emission reductions 
nevertheless  the state will make significant progress in meeting its ghg emission targets in light of the enactment of sb  which codifies an agreement that the only coal fired generation facility operating in the state with which we have no involvement to completely cease coal fired operations by 
table of contents avista corporation washington state s department of ecology has adopted regulations to ensure that its state implementation plan comports with the requirements of the epa s regulation of ghg emissions 
we will continue to monitor actions by the department as it may proceed to adopt additional regulations under its caa authorities 
late in  a federal district court ruled that the department of ecology must require six refineries located in the state to install reasonably available control technology to control and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 
this decision turned  in part  on the meaning of air contaminate under washington law 
the court observed that while the operative statute did not explicitly identify greenhouse gases  governor gregoire s executive order defined air contaminate as including greenhouse gases 
it remains to be determined whether the decision will be appealed or if and how it might impact other industries 
washington and oregon apply a ghg emissions performance standard to electric generation facilities used to serve loads in their jurisdictions 
the emissions performance standard prevents utilities from constructing or purchasing generation facilities  or entering into long term contracts five years or more to purchase energy produced by plants that have emission levels higher than  pounds of ghg per mwh until  at which time it will be reviewed and may be lowered by administrative rule to reflect the emissions profile of the latest commercially available combined cycle combustion turbine 
initiative measure i  the energy independence act  was passed into law through the general election in washington 
i requires investor owned  cooperative  and government owned electric utilities with over  customers to acquire qualified renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits in incremental amounts until those resources or credits equal percent of the utility s total retail load in i also requires these utilities to meet biennial energy conservation targets  the first of which must be met in furthermore  by january   electric utilities subject to i s mandates must have acquired enough qualified incremental renewable energy and or renewable energy credits to meet percent of their load 
failure to comply with renewable energy and energy efficiency standards could result in penalties of per mwh or greater being assessed against a utility for each mwh it is deficient in meeting a standard 
a utility would be deemed to comply with the renewable energy standard if it invests at least percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement on the incremental costs of renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits 
as noted in the following section  we have taken the steps necessary to meet the requirements of i electric integrated resource plan in august  we filed our electric integrated resource plan irp with the wutc and the ipuc 
we are required to file an irp every two years 
the irp details projected load growth and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next years 
we regard the irp as a tool for resource evaluation  rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project 
highlights of the irp include a contract for the mw palouse wind  llc project  which is expected to help meet the requirements of washington state energy independence act i beginning in  as well as provide a new resource to serve our customers increasing energy needs 
an additional amw of wind or qualifying renewable resource or energy credits are required under the same act beginning in energy efficiency measures are expected to save amw of cumulative energy over the year irp timeframe 
this aggressive effort could reduce load growth to half of what it would be without these measures 
mw of new natural gas fired generation facilities are required between and three grid modernization programs are projected to save amw of energy by transmission upgrades will be needed to deliver the energy from new generation resources to the distribution lines serving customers 
we will continue to participate in regional efforts to expand the region s transmission system 
in june  we entered into a year power purchase agreement ppa with palouse wind  llc palouse wind  an affiliate of first wind holdings  llc 
under the ppa  we will acquire all of the power and renewable attributes produced by a wind project being developed by palouse wind in whitman county  washington 
the wind project is expected to have a nameplate capacity of approximately mw and produce approximately amw with deliveries beginning by the end of we decided to enter into this ppa due  in part  to market changes reducing the cost of renewable resource projects 
this was due  in part  to tax incentives for the construction of renewable resource projects that remain in effect through we acquired the development rights for a separate wind generation site near reardan  washington in and continue to study that site in preparation for later development 
we plan to meet the state of washington s renewable energy standards until with a combination of qualified upgrades at our existing hydroelectric generation plants 
the power purchased from palouse wind will help to meet our washington renewable energy requirements beginning in  as well as provide a new energy resource to serve our system retail load requirements 
under the ppa  we have the option to purchase the wind project each year following the th anniversary of the commercial operation date at a price determined under the contract 

table of contents avista corporation the amount of renewable resources in our future irps could change if the cost effectiveness of those resources changes or if new or modified renewable energy standards are enacted at either the state or federal levels 
as part of our irp  we included estimates of climate change into the retail load forecast 
the recent trend has been a warming climate compared to the year normal 
trends in heating and cooling degree days for spokane are roughly equal to the scientific community s predictions for this geographic area  implying one degree fahrenheit of warming every years 
we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our results of operations 
estimated costs of ghg emissions were also included in the development of the irp market prices 
clean air act we must comply with the requirements under the clean air act caa in operating our thermal generating plants 
the caa currently requires a title v operating permit for colstrip which is in the process of being renewed  coyote springs which will expire in  the kettle falls gs which will be renewed in  and the rathdrum ct which will expire in 
boulder park and the northeast ct currently require only minor source operating permits based on their limited operation and emissions 
the caa also requires acid rain program monitoring  reporting and emissions trading for colstrip  coyote springs and the rathdrum ct 
we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments for several programs within the caa such as the national ambient air quality standards naaqs  new source performance standards and the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps or maximum achievable control technology mact 
montana mercury regulation and the epa s mercury air toxic standards mats in  the montana department of environmental quality montana deq adopted final rules for the control of mercury emissions from coal fired plants that impose strict emission limitations beginning in colstrip installed and is successfully operating a mercury emission control system which meets the montana mercury regulation 
the epa finalized the mats formerly known as the utility mact on december  to control hazardous air pollutants including mercury from coal and oil fired power plants 
the final version of the rule contains a mercury standard that is less stringent than the montana mercury regulation therefore colstrip s existing emission control system should be sufficient to meet mercury compliance 
for the remaining portion of the rule that specifically addresses air toxics including metals and acid gases  the joint owners are currently evaluating what type of new emission controls systems may be needed for mats compliance in we are unable to determine to what extent or if there will be any material impacts to colstrip at this time 
national ambient air quality standards naaqs we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at both the state and national levels for potential operating limitations that may results from updates to the naaqs 
the caa requires regular updates which have been recently court mandated to occur in june for nitrogen dioxide  ozone and particulate matter 
we have thermal power plants in washington  idaho  montana and oregon 
since the epa has designated most of the western states in which we operate as attainment areas  we do not anticipate any material impacts on our thermal plants from the required updates of these new standards at this time 
regional haze program the united states congress addressed regional visibility in the caa amendments and the epa published the final regional haze regulations in the epa s regulations set a national goal of eliminating man made visibility degradation in class i areas by the year the states were expected to take actions through state implementation plans sips to make reasonable progress through year plans  including application of best available retrofit technology bart requirements 
in  the epa announced that many states had failed to submit the required sips by the deadline 
in  environmental groups sued the epa for inaction which resulted in court ordered deadlines for a montana federal implementation plan fip in july bart is a retrofit program applied to large emission sources  including electric generating units built between and in february  colstrip was notified by the epa that colstrip units of which we are not an owner were determined to be subject to the epa s bart requirements 
in november  the epa issued a request for additional reasonable progress information for colstrip units of which we are a percent owner 
the owners of colstrip units have submitted the requested information and await the epa s upcoming fip proposal  which will include the epa s determination of bart for colstrip units we are unable to determine to what extent or if there will be any material impacts to colstrip at this time 

table of contents avista corporation coal ash management disposal currently  coal combustion byproducts ccbs are not regulated by the epa as a hazardous waste 
under a proposed rule issued in  the epa is reconsidering the classification of ccbs under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the draft rules included two options to require management of ccbs as a hazardous waste under subtitle c of the rcra  or to regulate coal ash under subtitle d  for non hazardous solid wastes  with possible special waste requirements 
should the epa determine to regulate ccbs as a hazardous waste under the rcra  such action could have a significant impact on future operations of colstrip 
fisheries a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout  are listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act 
efforts to protect these and other species have not directly impacted generation levels at any of our hydroelectric facilities 
we purchase power under long term contracts with certain puds with hydroelectric generation projects on the columbia river that are directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on our operations at this time 
we cannot predict the economic costs to us resulting from future mitigation measures 
we received a year ferc operating license for cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in march that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  including bull trout  is a key part of the agreement 
the result is a collaborative native salmonid restoration program with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana on the lower clark fork river  consistent with requirements of the ferc license 
the us fish wildlife service issued an updated critical habitat designation for bull trout in that includes the lower clark fork river  as well as portions of the coeur d alene basin within our spokane river project area  and is currently developing a final bull trout recovery plan under the esa 
issues related to these activities are expected to be worked out through the ongoing collaborative effort of our clark fork and spokane river ferc licenses 
see hydroelectric licensing and fish passage at cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
western power market issues the ferc continues to conduct proceedings and investigations related to market controls within the western united states that include proposals by certain parties to impose refunds  and some of the ferc s decisions have been appealed in federal courts 
certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds from us  which could result in liabilities for refunding revenues recognized in prior periods 
we have joined other parties in opposing these proposals 
we believe that we have adequate reserves established for refunds that may be ordered 
the refund proceedings provide that any refunds would be offset against unpaid energy debts due to the same party 
as of december   our accounts receivable outstanding related to defaulting parties in california were fully offset by reserves for uncollected amounts and funds collected from defaulting parties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are commodity prices for electric power and natural gas credit related to the wholesale energy market interest rates on long term and short term debt foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar commodity price risk electric power commodities we are exposed to market risks for electric power because of imbalances between available power supply resources and our load obligations  substitution of resources to achieve economic dispatch from available power supply choices  and our objective to optimize the value of specific power resource facilities 

table of contents avista corporation imbalances between available power supply resources and our electric load obligations arise because of seasonal factors  operating parameters of our facilities  contract rights and contract obligations  and variations in customer demand 
we forecast both obligations and resources to estimate our future surplus or deficit positions 
we hedge a portion of the open position with forward transactions that establish physical supply or disposition and or financially equivalent derivatives that mitigate economic uncertainty 
seasonal factors and prevailing weather affect power supplies 
supply is affected by both temperature and the timing and amount of precipitation  particularly with respect to our hydroelectric generation facilities that rely on river flows from immediate precipitation and from melting snow 
wind conditions affect the amount and timing of supply from wind generation facilities 
operational parameters affecting power resources include natural river flow  water storage and regulation driven constraints for hydroelectric generation 
operational parameters also include maintenance requirements and forced outages at electric generating plants  fuel availability for thermal plants  environmental and other regulatory constraints and other factors 
electric power obligations include retail customer demand and other commitments between avista corp 
and other parties in the wholesale power market 
retail customer demand is sensitive to temperature extremes and to normal seasonal temperature variation that impacts customers heating and cooling related demand for energy 
obligations are also affected by customer growth  economic conditions  technology that adds to or reduces electric demand  and choices that customers make about energy usage 
our forecasts of obligations consider contract terms  past energy demand patterns and indicators of potential changes in energy consumption 
economic dispatch involves the decisions that we make in the mix of power resources to meet our retail customer requirements and other obligations 
we make dispatch decisions to operate or not operate our resources and to dispose of energy or to obtain resources from others in the wholesale power market including natural gas fuel markets 
hydroelectric generation is typically the lowest cost source of supply 
thermal generation resource costs vary with fuel costs and other factors 
power purchase agreements may provide us with variable power supply quantities and contract terms can include both fixed and variable costs 
to balance electric power resources and electric demand obligations  we enter into transactions in the wholesale power and fuel markets 
these transactions include physical power and natural gas and derivative instruments based on wholesale prices of power and natural gas 
wholesale market prices tend to vary with natural gas fuel costs to the extent that natural gas fired resources are the least cost alternative in the region which is often the case in recent years 
wholesale prices also tend to vary with the extent of hydroelectric surplus or shortages  particularly during the highest hydroelectric generation periods of spring rains and snow melt 
wholesale prices also vary to a greater extent each year based on wind patterns as wind generation facilities have grown significantly in the region 
generating resource availability and regional demand tend to impact energy prices 
wholesale prices are quoted for energy to be delivered in time frames ranging from immediate real time  to minute  hourly  daily  multi day  monthly  quarterly and annually 
future market prices extend several years into the future  though market liquidity tends to become limited beyond a few years into the future 
natural gas commodities natural gas is a significant source of fuel for electric generation 
we buy natural gas as fuel for electric generating facilities that we own and for the lancaster plant where we have contractual rights to dispatch its operation 
we also sell natural gas when we have an opportunity to displace thermal generation with other power supply resources or when expected thermal generation does not actually occur for any reason 
we hedge a portion of these natural gas purchases and sales  including the use of physical delivery contracts and derivative instruments based on wholesale prices of natural gas 
we also transact based on index pricing in the wholesale natural gas market and at spot market prices that can vary significantly 
some  but not all  natural gas transactions related to thermal generation are executed concurrently with similar quantities of electric energy based on physical fuel to power conversion parameters of generation facilities that we own or control 
in such cases  the net economic cost or benefit between natural gas purchases and power sales or gas sales offset by power purchases will vary as each commodity price moves independently of the other 
we also purchase natural gas for delivery to retail natural gas customers 
some natural gas is purchased for injection into storage  which can later be withdrawn from storage 
to a lesser extent  we also sell natural gas originally purchased for retail natural gas supply or inventory back into the wholesale market 
some of the wholesale natural gas transactions are executed at fixed prices for future delivery  while some are executed based on market index prices or spot prices 
we transact for physical delivery of natural gas and we enter into swaps that create a financial hedge for future natural gas prices 
we also enter into natural gas transactions intended to extract value from our assets and contract rights 
these asset optimization transactions include purchases and offsetting sales at two delivery locations when we have excess capacity available in natural gas pipelines such pipelines are usually owned by other parties where we have contract rights for that capacity 
asset optimization strategies also include time difference purchases and sales of natural gas that use excess storage capacity available in our underground natural gas storage facilities 
these transactions include commitments for future physical delivery and or financial swaps tied to the price of natural gas 

table of contents avista corporation matters affecting both electric and natural gas commodities variation in electric and natural gas commodity prices affects our cash flow  customer retail rates and the amount of net income we recognize 
regulatory cost recovery mechanisms address these power supply cost variations  such that a portion of the cost variation is passed on to customers and a portion is recognized by the company 
the timing of incurring costs can be significantly different than the timing for recovering costs  resulting in the need for a significant liquidity cushion 
historically  we have carried significant balances of deferred power supply and natural gas supply costs  which represent costs we expect to recover from customers in future retail rates  subject to approval by regulators 
when we have surplus electric generation  its value varies with market prices and economics of other resources in the region 
when we have a shortage of electric generation from our own resources and other resources that we have long term rights to control  the cost to obtain electric power or fuel varies 
we make forecasts to estimate surplus and deficit conditions and we may enter into forward hedging arrangements to reduce the expected net surplus or deficit 
our forecasts cannot avoid uncertainty about loads or obligations and we do not attempt to fully hedge all forecast net open positions 
our hedges include forward transactions ranging from minutes to multiple years in the future  with transaction blocks of minute  hourly  daily  monthly  quarterly and annually 
we are not able to predict how the combination of energy resources  energy loads  prices  rate recovery and other factors will ultimately drive deferred power costs and the timing of recovery of our costs in future periods 
see further information at avista utilities regulatory matters 
see risk management for additional information on our activities to hedge our exposure to price risk by making forward commitments for energy purchases and sales 
wholesale electricity prices are affected by a number of factors  including demand for electricity  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  adequacy of generating reserve margins  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  price and availability of fuel for thermal generating plants  and disruptions to or constraints on transmission facilities 
wholesale natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors  including overall actual and expected changes in the north american natural gas supply mix including the growth in unconventional supplies such as natural gas from shale  natural gas production that can be delivered to our service areas  level of imports and exports  particularly from canada by pipeline  level of inventories and regional accessibility  demand for natural gas  including natural gas as fuel for electric generation  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  global energy markets  including oil or other natural gas substitutes  and availability of pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from region to region 
any combination of these factors that results in a shortage of energy generally causes the market price to move upward 
factors such as a general economic downturn  increased proven energy reserves  or increased production generally reduce market prices for energy 
in addition to these factors  wholesale power markets are subject to regulatory constraints including price controls 
price risk also includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments such as options and forward contracts 
price risk may also be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
substantially all forward contracts to purchase or sell power and natural gas are recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at estimated fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability 
contracts that are not considered derivatives are generally accounted for on the accrual basis until they are settled or realized  unless there is a decline in the fair value of the contract that is determined to be other than temporary 

table of contents avista corporation the following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values as a net asset or liability as of december  that are expected to settle in each respective year dollars in thousands purchases sales electric derivatives gas derivatives electric derivatives gas derivatives year physical financial physical financial physical financial physical financial thereafter credit risk credit risk relates to potential losses that we would incur as a result of non performance of contractual obligations by counterparties to deliver energy or make financial settlements 
we often extend credit to counterparties and customers  and we are exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts owed to us 
credit risk includes potential counterparty default due to circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  caused by market price changes  and relating to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
changes in market prices may dramatically alter the size of credit risk with counterparties  even when we establish conservative credit limits 
should a counterparty fail to perform  we may be required to honor the underlying commitment or to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by entering into bilateral contracts that specify credit terms and protections against default  applying credit limits and duration criteria to existing and prospective counterparties  actively monitoring current credit exposures  and conducting some of our transactions on exchanges with fully collateralized clearing arrangements that significantly reduce counterparty default risk 
our credit policies include an evaluation of the financial condition and credit ratings of counterparties  collateral requirements or other credit enhancements  such as letters of credit or parent company guarantees 
we also use standardized agreements that allow for the netting or offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty or affiliated group 
however  despite mitigation efforts  the risk of default cannot be entirely eliminated 
we regularly evaluate counterparties credit exposure for future settlements and delivery obligations 
we reduce or eliminate open unsecured credit limits and implement other credit risk reduction measures for parties perceived to have increased default risk 
counterparty collateral is used to offset our credit risk where warranted in light of unsettled net positions and their future obligations to us 
we have concentrations of suppliers and customers in the electric and natural gas industries including electric and natural gas utilities  electric generators and transmission providers  natural gas producers and pipelines  financial institutions including commodity clearing exchanges and related parties  and energy marketing and trading companies 
in addition  we have concentrations of credit risk related to geographic location in the western united states and western canada 
these concentrations of counterparties and concentrations of geographic location may affect our overall exposure to credit risk because the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in conditions 
credit risk also involves demands on our capital 
we are subject to limits and credit risks that counterparties perceive related to our ability to perform deliveries and settlement under physical and financial energy contracts 
many of our counterparties allow unsecured credit at limits prescribed by agreements or their discretion 
capital requirements for certain transaction types involve a combination of initial margin and market value margins without any unsecured credit threshold 
counterparties may seek assurances of performance from us in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits 

table of contents avista corporation credit exposure can change significantly in periods of price volatility 
as a result  sudden and significant demands may be made against our credit facilities and cash 
we actively monitor the exposure to possible collateral calls and take steps to minimize capital requirements 
counterparties credit exposure to us is dynamic in normal markets and may change significantly in more volatile markets 
the amount of potential default risk to us from each counterparty depends on the extent of forward contracts  unsettled transactions and market prices 
there is a risk that we may seek additional collateral from counterparties that are unable or unwilling to provide it 
risk management for energy resources we use a variety of techniques to manage risks for energy resources and wholesale energy market activities 
we have an energy resources risk policy and control procedures to manage these risks  both qualitative and quantitative 
our risk management committee has established our risk management policy for energy resources 
the risk management committee is comprised of certain officers and other management 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors periodically reviews and discusses enterprise risk management processes  and it focuses on the company s material financial and accounting risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to control them 
our risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and meetings 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  regulation and other factors may result in losses of earnings  cash flows and or fair values 
our risk management committee has also established a wholesale energy markets credit policy 
the credit policy is designed to reduce the risk of financial loss in case counterparties default on delivery or settlement obligations and to conserve our liquidity as other parties may place credit limits or require cash collateral 
in implementing our risk management policy for energy resources  we measure the volume of monthly  quarterly and annual energy imbalances between projected power loads and resources 
the measurement process is based on expected loads at fixed prices including those subject to retail rates and expected resources to the extent that costs are essentially fixed by virtue of known fuel supply costs or projected hydroelectric conditions 
to the extent that expected costs are not fixed  either because of volume mismatches between loads and resources or because fuel cost is not locked in through fixed price contracts or derivative instruments  our risk policy guides the process to manage this open forward position over a period of time 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
we are able to vary the operation of generating resources to match parts of minute  hourly  daily and weekly load fluctuations 
we use the wholesale power markets  including the natural gas market as it relates to power generation fuel  to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected 
we buy and sell fuel for thermal generation facilities based on comparative power market prices and marginal costs of fueling and operating available generating facilities and the relative economics of substitute market purchases for generating plant operation 
to address the impact on our operations of energy market price volatility  our hedging practices for electricity including fuel for generation and natural gas extend beyond the current operating year 
executing this extended hedging program may increase our credit risks 
our credit risk management process is designed to mitigate such credit risks through limit setting  contract protections and counterparty diversification  among other practices 
electric load resource imbalances within a planning horizon up to months ahead are compared against established volumetric guidelines 
management determines the timing and actions to manage the imbalances 
we also assess available resource alternatives and actions that are appropriate for longer term planning periods 
expected load and resource volumes for forward periods are based on monthly and quarterly averages that may vary significantly from the actual loads and resources within any individual month or operating day 
future projections of resources are updated as forecasted streamflows and other factors differ from prior estimates 
forward power markets may be illiquid  and market products available may not match our desired transaction size and shape 
therefore  open imbalance positions exist at any given time 
our projected natural gas loads and resources are regularly reviewed by operating management and the risk management committee 
to manage the impacts of volatile natural gas prices  we seek to procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and time periods 
we have an active hedging program that extends four years into the future with the goal of reducing price volatility in our natural gas supply costs 
we use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices are likely to be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years at multiple basins mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 

table of contents avista corporation interest rate risk we are affected by fluctuating interest rates related to a portion of our existing debt and our future borrowing requirements 
we manage interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization 
additionally  interest rate risk is managed by monitoring market conditions when timing the issuance of long term debt and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
we also hedge a portion of our interest rate risk with financial derivative instruments  which may include interest rate swaps and us treasury lock agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements are considered economic hedges against fluctuations in future cash flows associated with anticipated debt issuances 
as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million and a mandatory cash settlement date of july we also have interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million and a mandatory cash settlement date of june as of december   we had a derivative liability of million and an offsetting regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
upon settlement of the interest rate swaps  the regulatory asset or liability included as part of long term debt will be amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the forecasted interest payments 
we estimate that a basis point increase in forward libor interest rates as of december  would decrease this derivative liability by million  while a basis point decrease would increase the liability by million 
the interest rate on million of long term debt to affiliated trusts is adjusted quarterly  reflecting current market rates 
amounts borrowed under our committed line of credit agreements have variable interest rates 
the following table shows our long term debt including current portion and related weighted average interest rates  by expected maturity dates as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate nonrecourse long term debt of spokane energy weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt to affiliated trusts weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk a significant portion of our utility natural gas supply including fuel for electric generation is obtained from canadian sources 
most of those transactions are executed in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency risk 
a portion of our short term natural gas transactions and long term canadian transportation contracts are committed based on canadian currency prices and settled within sixty days with us dollars 
we economically hedge a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing canadian currency when such commodity transactions are initiated 
this risk has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and these differences in cost related to currency fluctuations were included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking 
as of december   we had a current derivative asset for foreign currency hedges of million included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had entered into canadian currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million million canadian
