this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and uncertainties and elsewhere in this document 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements above 
overview we commenced our exploration stage in january with the change in the management of the company 
from january until march  we were strictly a mineral exploration company 
with the subsequent acquisition of a drilling services company  the acquisition of butte highlands  and the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd  we advanced our business plan 
prior to our new business model  the purchase of timberline drilling formerly known as kettle drilling  and a more active and focused exploration division  the company had no reported revenues and accumulated losses 
during we have continued to focus our business model on mineral exploration and development  with future revenues and cash flows  if any  to be derived from any future mineral production 
during the previous year  we actively sought a buyer for our drilling services subsidiary  timberline drilling  as we had determined that timberline drilling was a non core business and that the market was optimal for achieving a sale of that subsidiary 
the sale of timberline drilling was completed in november for a total realized value of approximately million 
at our south eureka property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  we followed up on the exploration and drilling programs of the previous two years with another drilling program that included an additional  feet designed to enhance our confidence in our estimated mineralized material and to obtain drill core for process metallurgical and geotechnical scoping studies 
we also initiated  or continued  geotechnical  geochemical studies as part of our preparations for permitting the lookout mountain project 
we announced an updated gold mineralization estimate in may  and we expect to complete a preliminary economic assessment of the project during our butte highlands joint venture in montana continued to progress towards commencement of production during the fiscal year 
our activities during were concentrated primarily on advancing permitting of the project 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  but prior to filing this report  we received a notice of completeness and compliance from the mtdeq  as well as a draft operating permit for the project 
we expect to obtain all necessary permits to commence production in mineral exploration in june   we acquired staccato gold resources ltd 
and its south eureka property in the nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  and is one of the largest undeveloped exploration properties in nevada  encompassing some square miles 
since our acquisition of the south eureka property we have completed an aggressive work program  including more than  feet of surface drilling  metallurgical testing  geotechnical and geochemical studies  as well as baseline environmental studies 
we have obtained sufficient data to complete an updated mineralization estimate  and updated ni technical reports were released by us in both march and may in addition  we completed detailed mapping of the geology of the property to better understand the controls of mineralization and to outline additional exploration drill targets that were tested during the drilling program as well as in future exploration drilling programs 
as of september  we have completed a  foot reverse circulation and diamond drilling program at south eureka  with as many as three drill rigs operating on site 
the program was designed to demonstrate strong continuity of mineralization on the property  as well as initial identification of high grade gold mineralization down dip of the current mineralization  we expect to proceed with a preliminary economic assessment of the lookout mountain project in  as well as continuing with ongoing metallurgical  geotechnical and environmental studies as part of this assessment 
assuming the availability of funding to undertake our exploration program  we expect that total expenditures on south eureka during fiscal will be approximately million 
these expenditures are discretionary and may be scaled back depending upon the availability of capital to us 
activities at our butte highlands joint venture during fiscal focused almost exclusively on completing the permitting process  with an expectation that all necessary permits to commence production will be received in we are a joint venture partner in the butte highlands joint venture and is being carried to production 
the required application has been submitted for an operating permit at butte highlands  and work is continuing on the other associated permits required for the operation  including a montana pollutant discharge elimination system permit and a special use permit from the united states forest service for ore haulage road use 
no material permitting obstacles are expected as the project advances toward targeted production 
surface facilities and infrastructure required for development and production are already in place under our exploration permit which has been in place since august timberline s butte highlands joint venture is the first example of our strategy to enter into creative structures that move production responsibility to other parties while allowing exposure to gold production  where financing has been provided by a third party with proven expertise in underground mine development and operation 
this has been achieved with no dilution to timberline shareholders 
as noted  all expenditures relating to the development of the projected underground mine are being paid by timberline s joint venture partner  with a total expected development budget of approximately usd million 
our management and geologists remain committed to providing exploration and potential for discovery to our investors 
looking ahead  it is the opinion of management that our primary commodity focus should be on gold  and to a lesser extent on silver in the precious metals area 
furthermore  we believe that projects similar to lookout mountain and butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people and strategic partners 
results of operations for years ended september  and consolidated results us year ended september  consolidated net loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax consolidated net loss our overall consolidated net loss for the year increased in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of the sale of our discontinued operations timberline drilling early in fiscal  as well as an increase in mineral exploration expenses by the company 
these exploration expenses were largely incurred at our south eureka property 
us year ended september  exploration expenses butte highlands south eureka lookout mountain other exploration properties total exploration expenditures non cash expenses stock option and stock issuance expense depreciation  amortization and accretion total non cash expenses gain on lease of mineral rights salaries and benefits professional fees expense impairment of available for sale securities other general and administrative expenses interest expense interest and other income income tax benefit net loss from continuing operations the increase in the after tax net loss for the year ended september  as compared to the previous year s after tax net loss is primarily a result of increased expenditures on mineral exploration at our south eureka lookout mountain property and higher salaries and benefits expenses 
during the year we added a new vice president  exploration  as well as incurred one time expenses for the cancellation and transfer of existing supplemental retirement plans to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
these increased expenses were partially offset by reduced non cash expenses  lower interest expense  increased interest income and a gain on the lease of mineral rights 
during the year we repaid our outstanding million debt obligation and commenced the receipt of interest income on a note receivable from the purchaser of timberline drilling 
the gain on lease of mineral rights was realized on the lease of our montana copper silver properties as more fully described in item of this annual report 
the income tax benefit during the year ended september  arose as a result of a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities assumed upon the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd 
exploration expenses increased significantly from the previous year as a result of increased exploration drilling undertaken in at our south eureka lookout mountain property 
non cash expenses decreased significantly in compared to the prior year as a result of a reduced value of stock options vesting during the current year 
other general and administrative expenses decreased in primarily due to reduced investor relations activities and use of outside consulting services  as well as a revamping of our marketing information  corporate logo  and website  and the initiation of payment of cash compensation to members of our board of directors in the previous year 
discontinued operations timberline drilling wwe in september  we announced that we had entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell our wholly owned timberline drilling subsidiary 
the results of operations for timberline drilling have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
prior to its disposal  timberline drilling continued to experience similar daily production rates from operating drills  revenues per foot drilled  and operating margins as it did in the previous fiscal year 
in november  the sale of timberline drilling was completed for a total value of approximately million  including the receipt of million in cash and an additional million in cash from timberline drilling s working capital immediately prior to closing 
the sale of timberline drilling resulted in a gain on disposal of  to the company 
during the year ended september  timberline drilling had record net income  primarily attributable to the addition of new customers during the year and an increase in the number of drill rigs working for timberline drilling s largest customer 
average daily production rates from operating drills and higher revenues per foot drilled contributed to the increase in net income from the previous year  offset in part by preparation costs associated with the deployment of surface drilling rigs to new customer locations and higher maintenance costs 
during  timberline drilling provided million in cash to us in order to fund our exploration expenses 
the following table details selected financial information included in the income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended september  and us year ended september  revenues cost of revenues operating expenses interest and other income interest expense net income gain on disposal income from discontinued operations  net of tax our consolidated balance sheet has no assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale at september  our consolidated balance sheet has assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale which were comprised of the following items at september  year ended september  cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable materials and supplies inventory prepaid expenses and other current assets total current assets held for sale property and equipment  net goodwill total non current assets held for sale accounts payable accrued expenses accrued payroll  benefits and taxes current portion of long term debt current portion of obligations under capital leases deferred revenue total current liabilities held for sale long term debt  net of current portion obligations under capital leases  net of current portion total non current liabilities held for sale financial condition and liquidity at september   we had assets of  consisting of cash in the amount of  a current note receivable of  a joint venture receivable of  restricted cash of  property  mineral rights  and equipment  net of depreciation of  and other assets of  disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
while access to capital has improved recently  these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  asset sales  credit facilities or debenture issuances 
at september  our working capital balance was  compared to working capital of  at september  management expects to maintain or increase the amount of working capital by monitoring discretionary exploration expenditures  minimizing professional and consulting expenses  and potentially obtaining financing through equity investments 
we plan to continue exploration programs on our material exploration properties  to fund some exploratory activities and drilling on early stage properties  and to seek additional acquisition opportunities 
during the year ended september   we entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell our timberline drilling subsidiary 
in november  the sale of timberline drilling was completed in exchange for million in cash  an additional million in cash from the existing working capital of timberline drilling  a promissory note in the principal amount of million with an interest rate of per annum  the assumption by the purchaser of approximately million of certain indebtedness of timberline drilling  and the provision of future discounted drilling services  or cash  to us up to a total value of  over a year period 
the total amount of consideration to be received by us was also subject to adjustment based upon the working capital of timberline drilling as of the closing date of the sale 
this adjustment resulted in the receipt of additional cash consideration of  in conjunction with the sale of timberline drilling during the year ended september   we repaid our  convertible term note payable to juniper resources  llc  an entity controlled by ron guill  a director of the company 
as a result  as of the date of filing of this report  we have no outstanding debt and a balance of cash on hand of approximately  for additional information regarding the operating  investing and financing cash flows associated with our discontinued operations  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
as a result of our current cash balance  our ability to curtail discretionary exploration expenditures as needed  and the expected satisfaction of our current note receivable of  from the sale of timberline drilling  management believes that it has sufficient working capital to meet our ongoing operating expenses for the next months 
however  additional financing will be required if we wish to fully implement our currently planned exploration programs or explore additional property acquisitions 
financing activities in february  we initiated a registered direct offering of our common stock to institutional investors in the united states 
we entered into securities purchase agreements to sell  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  and the offering closed in march we incurred  in expenses with respect to the offering  resulting in net proceeds of  proceeds from the offering were used to fund ongoing exploration activities at our lookout mountain project  as well as for general working capital 
on october  we entered into a convertible note with small mine development smd  a company owned by ron guill  a director of the company 
the convertible note has a principal amount of million and is collateralized with all of the stock of timberline drilling  inc  as well as a deed of trust covering our butte highlands property in silver bow county  montana the butte highlands property and a right of first refusal over our butte highlands property the right of first refusal 
the convertible note bears interest at annually  compounded monthly  with interest payments due at maturity on october  the convertible note  including accrued interest  is convertible into common stock by smd at any time prior to payment of the note in full  at a conversion price of per share 
should we issue any form of equity security other than our common stock  smd may also convert all or any portion of the outstanding amount under the convertible term note into the new form of equity security at the issuance price of the new form of equity security 
the convertible note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty 
if we default on the convertible note  smd may declare the convertible note immediately due and payable  and we must pay smd an origination fee in the amount of  under the right of first refusal  we granted smd a right of first refusal to purchase the butte highlands property on the same terms as those of any bona fide offer from a third party upon days notice from the company of any such offer 
in addition  we granted smd a right to develop the butte highlands property on the same terms as those of any bona fide offer to develop the property from a third party upon days notice from us of any such offer 
in june  smd agreed to extend the maturity date of the convertible note to on or before april  we paid all interest accrued through june  to smd at that time 
we also paid a  extension fee to smd in consideration for the extension of the convertible note 
the convertible note was also amended to require interest accrued subsequent to june  to be paid by us to smd monthly  rather than accruing interest to maturity 
all other terms of the loan were unchanged 
effective december  smd assigned the convertible note and all related agreements and rights to juniper resources  llc  an entity also controlled by ron guill 
during the year ended september   we repaid the entire balance of the convertible note and accrued interest as of the date of repayment and cancelled all of the related agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows asset impairments significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized 
the evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineralized material associated with the properties  and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
if no mineable ore body is discovered  or market conditions for minerals deteriorate  there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties 
we review the carrying value of equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the equipment is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
asset retirement obligations we have an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expects to incur in association with our south eureka property 
we estimate applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
a liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the offsetting balance is charged to the related long lived asset 
adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the asc guidance for consolidation accounting was updated to require an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 
 accordingly  we adopted this updated guidance in fiscal year with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this standard will require entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity is eliminated 
the new requirements are generally effective for public entities in fiscal years including interim periods beginning after december  management does not believe asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations timberline and its subsidiaries lease office space and storage facilities 
all of these facilities  which we believe are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future  are leased 
under the current leases  we paid rental payments of  in the fiscal year ending september  the current leases call for the following fiscal year payments
