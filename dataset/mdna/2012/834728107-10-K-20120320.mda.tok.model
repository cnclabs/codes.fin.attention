item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements some of the statements in this document discuss future expectations  contain projections or results of operations or financial conditions or state other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risk  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
we based the forward looking statements on various factors and using numerous assumptions 
important factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by forward looking statements include those disclosed under item a risk factors as well as the following factors the success or failure of our efforts to implement our business strategy  the effect of changing economic conditions and  in particular  changes in interest rates  changes in government regulations  tax rates and similar matters  our ability to attract and retain quality employees  and other risks which may be described in our future filings with the sec 
we do not promise to update forward looking information to reflect actual results or changes in assumptions or other factors that could affect those statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected by declines in real estate values  or if the central or northern areas of new jersey experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
overview and strategy the company serves as a holding company for the bank  which is its primary asset and only operating subsidiary 
the bank conducts a traditional banking business  making commercial loans  consumer loans  and residential and commercial real estate loans 
in addition  the bank offers various non deposit products through non proprietary relationships with third party vendors 
the bank relies primarily upon deposits as the funding source for its assets 
the bank offers traditional deposit products 
in addition  as an alternative to traditional certificate of deposit accounts  the bank offers its paramount checking account  a retail interest paying checking account which also provides a suite of additional services  such as free checks  free telephone banking and free bill payment  free safe deposit box and refunds for foreign atm fees 
although the rate the bank pays on the paramount checking account may be higher than the rate offered on interest paying checking accounts by many of the bank s competitors  management believes the account has helped to reduce the bank s overall cost of funds and has been an integral part of the bank s core account acquisition strategy 
core accounts consist of noninterest bearing deposits demand  now  money market and savings accounts 
paramount checking account balances are generally higher than other account balances  and the account helps the bank develop an overall relationship with its customers  which frequently leads to cross selling opportunities  which the bank actively pursues through direct mailings and other special promotions 
another component to the bank s core account acquisition strategy is the generation of deposit accounts which result from new commercial loan customers who move their deposit relationship to the bank and the continued expansion of the bank s escrow ease product 
escrow ease is specially designed to meet the trust account needs of attorneys  realtors and title companies 
at december   the core account balances represented of total deposit balances 
through its sullivan financial services subsidiary sullivan  the bank also engages in mortgage banking operations  originating loans primarily for resale into the secondary market and  to a lesser extent  for the bank s loan portfolio 
we treat the operations of sullivan as a separate reporting segment apart from our community banking business 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for financial information on our business segments 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on funds borrowed to support those assets  primarily deposits 
net interest margin is the difference between the weighted average rate received on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and is also affected by the average level of interest earning assets as compared with that of interest bearing liabilities 
net income is also affected by the amount of non interest income and non interest expenses 
results of operations versus net income net income for was million  up  or  from million in diluted earnings per share was for  a increase from in the significant improvement in both net income and earnings per share for versus was due primarily to higher net interest income  lower staff related costs  and lower occupancy expenses partially offset by lower gains on sale of residential mortgages 
also impacting were two significant items a  tax free boli death benefit and a  pretax  after taxes charge on the early extinguishment of certain of the bank s federal home loan bank borrowings 
net interest income net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for totaled million  an increase of  or  from million earned in the increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest earning assets  to million in from million in  and was partially offset by a basis point decline  to in from in  in the net interest margin 
the increase in average interest earning assets was largely due to a growth in average loans  primarily funded by growth in core deposits 
average loans grew by to million in from million in  while average core deposits defined as all deposits other than time deposits grew by to million in from million in the excess of growth in core deposits over growth in loans increased the bank s average cash and due from banks balances by million 
the decrease in net interest margin in versus was due to the aforementioned increase in cash and due from banks  which was predominantly invested at low overnight rates  as well as the re pricing characteristics of our loans and investment securities  which re priced downward at a faster pace than our deposits 
average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average assets and liabilities for the years ended december    and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
securities available for sale are reflected in the following table at amortized cost 
non accrual loans are included in the average loan balance 
for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost assets interest earning assets interest earning deposits loans receivable investment securities loans held for sale restricted stock federal funds sold total interest earning assets non interest earning assets allowance for loan losses total assets liabilities and stockholders equity interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances other borrowings federal funds purchased total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income net interest rate spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread equals total interest earning assets yield less total interest bearing liabilities cost 
net interest margin equals net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets 
the data contained in the table has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis  based on the company s federal statutory rate of percent 
management believes that this presentation provides comparability of net interest income and net interest margin arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice and sec rules 
rate volume analysis the following table presents  by category  the major factors that contributed to the changes in net interest income 
changes due to both volume and rate have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amount change in each 
year ended december  versus year ended december  versus in thousands increase decrease due to change in average increase decrease due to change in average volume rate net volume rate net interest income cash and due from banks loans securities loans held for sale restricted stock federal funds sold total interest income interest expense interest bearing deposits savings accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances federal funds purchased total interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses for the year ended december   the company s provision for loan losses was thousand  an increase of thousand from thousand for the year ended december  the increase in provision for loan losses in versus was largely due to growth in the loan portfolio in this was in contrast to when the bank s originations of new loans were essentially offset by maturities and pay downs 
the company s asset quality metrics  such as nonaccrual loan  charge off  and delinquency ratios remain sound relative to its competitive peer groups  and the relatively low level of loan loss provisioning during both and reflects very few new problem credits 
nevertheless  management continues to believe that there remains heightened risks in certain segments of the loan portfolio 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of its allowance and may provide for additional provisions in future periods due to increased general weakness in the economy or in our geographic trade area  deterioration or impairment of specific credits  or as management may deem necessary 
non interest income the largest component of our non interest income is gains on sales of mortgage loans originated by sullivan  our mortgage company subsidiary see segment reporting 
the company also earns non interest revenue from additional sources such as bank owned life insurance boli  wealth management  fees on deposit accounts  atm usage  wire transfer  lock box services  and safe deposit boxes 
non interest income was million for the full year  down thousand from million earned during the decrease was primarily due to a thousand decline in gains on sales of residential mortgage loans  due to reduced origination volume at sullivan financial services  inc  a wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary of the bank 
sullivan s loans originated for sale fell to million in from million in  reflecting continued weakness in home sales and reduced refinance activity 
partially offsetting this decline were a thousand increase in boli income  due principally to the above mentioned death benefit  thousand of gains on sales of investment securities and higher debit card  lock box  and wealth management revenue 
non interest expense management continued its focus on operating efficiency throughout non interest expense for  which included a thousand loss on debt extinguishment  was essentially flat at million versus million in excluding the loss on debt extinguishment non interest expense decreased by thousand  or  from the components of the decrease included salaries and employee benefits  which were lower by thousand  largely due to lower staff count  occupancy expense  which was lower by thousand primarily due to consolidation of back office space and lower deprecation of fixed assets  advertising and business promotions  which declined by thousand  and other operating expenses  which declined by thousand  largely due to lower fdic insurance premium expense due to a change in the assessment calculation method which benefited most community banks in the nation 
income taxes the company recorded provisions for income taxes of million for both the full year and the effective tax rates were for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the previously mentioned tax free boli death benefit received in financial condition total assets as of december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  loans receivable increased by million to million at year end  investments available for sale increased by million  while total cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
the increase in total assets was predominantly funded by growth in core deposits defined as all deposits other than time deposits  which increased by million to million as of year end  and was partially offset by a million decline in federal home loan bank advances 
loan growth picked up in versus reflecting stabilizing economic conditions in the bank s primary market  as well as management s successful efforts to originate loans to credit worthy borrowers 
loan growth was strong in  but was still outpaced by deposit growth resulting in continued high levels of cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at year end and  respectively 
at year end  the bank s loan pipeline was strong and management expects continued strong loan growth into the first half of loan portfolio the bank s lending activities are generally oriented to small to medium sized businesses  high net worth individuals  professional practices and consumer and retail customers living and working in the bank s market area of somerset  morris and union counties  new jersey 
the bank has not made loans to borrowers outside of the united states 
the bank believes that its strategy of customer service  competitive rate structures and selective marketing have enabled it to gain market entry 
bank mergers and lending restrictions at larger banks competing with the bank have also contributed to the bank s success in attracting borrowers 
commercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as cash balances with the bank  marketable securities held by or under the control of the bank  business assets including accounts receivable  inventory and equipment and liens on commercial and residential real estate 
construction  land and land development loans include loans secured by first liens on commercial or residential properties to finance the construction or renovation of such properties 
commercial mortgages include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties to purchase or refinance such properties 
residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on residential real estate  and are generally made to existing customers of the bank to purchase or refinance primary and secondary residences 
consumer loans consist primarily of home equity loans secured by st or nd liens 
during  the loan portfolio was positively impacted by an increase in commercial real estate loan demand  as well as refinancing strategies employed by many of the bank s borrowers 
with regard to new loan originations  the bank has made a strategic decision to hold in its loan portfolio a portion of residential mortgages that meet our credit quality standards that were closed by sullivan financial  the bank s mortgage banking subsidiary 
the following table sets forth the classification of our loans by major category as of december     and  respectively december  amount percent of total loans amount percent of total loans amount percent of total loans amount percent of total loans amount percent of total loans commercial construction  land and land development commercial mortgages residential mortgages consumer gross loans net deferred costs fees total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans the following table sets forth fixed and adjustable rate loans in the loan portfolio as of december  in terms of contractual maturity in thousands within one year to years after years total loans with fixed rate loans with adjustable rate asset quality the company s principal assets are its loans 
inherent in the lending function is the risk of the borrower s inability to repay a loan under its existing terms 
the company attempts to minimize overall credit risk through loan diversification and its loan approval procedures 
due diligence begins at the time a borrower and the company begin to discuss the origination of a loan 
documentation  including a borrower s credit history  materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral  the purpose of the loan  the source and timing of the repayment of the loan  and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval 
loans made are also subject to periodic audit and review 
non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans delinquent days or more and still accruing and other real estate owned oreo 
generally  a loan is placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due for a period of days or more  unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest  including interest applicable to prior periods  is reversed and charged against current income 
oreo refers to real estate acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the oreo property is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value at the time of acquisition 
estimated fair value generally represents the estimated sale price based on current market conditions  less estimated costs to sell the property 
holding costs and declines in estimated fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition 
in limited situations the company will modify or restructure a borrower s existing loan terms and conditions 
a restructured loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdrs when the company  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower in modifying or renewing a loan that the institution would not otherwise consider 
as of december   the company had one tdr totaling thousand  which is currently performing under its restructured terms

as of december  and  there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of the company s total loans 
the company s loans are primarily to businesses and individuals located in northern and central new jersey 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for probable incurred loan losses 
the level of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio  after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
loan charge offs ie  loans judged to be uncollectible are charged against the reserve and any subsequent recovery is credited 
the company s officers analyze risks within the loan portfolio on a continuous basis  through an external independent loan review function  and by the company s audit committee 
a risk system  consisting of multiple grading categories for each portfolio class  is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves 
in addition to the risk system  management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower  past and expected loss experience  and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve 
these estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are recognized in the periods in which they become known 
although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate  future economic changes  deterioration of borrowers creditworthiness  and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to the company s allowance for loan losses

corporate debt securities consist of trust preferred securities and corporate debt securities issued by various large capitalization financial institutions 
securities are classified as held to maturity htm  available for sale afs  or trading at time of purchase 
securities are classified as htm based upon management s intent and the company s ability to hold them to maturity 
such securities are stated at cost  adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts

securities classified as afs include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  the need to increase regulatory capital  or other similar requirements 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities  whether afs or htm  at the time of purchase 
the carrying value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio increased by million from year end to million at year end this increase was primarily due to purchases of general obligation bonds and mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies

three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total liquidity the company s liquidity is a measure of its ability to fund loans  withdrawals or maturities of deposits  and other cash outflows in a cost effective manner 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal  maturities of investment securities  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
at december   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that  on a short and long term basis  contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational and customer credit needs could be satisfied 
as of december   liquid assets cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at other banks and unencumbered investment securities were million  which represented of total assets and of total deposits and borrowings 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york and  based on available qualified collateral as of december   had the ability to borrow million 
the bank also has a credit facility with the federal reserve bank of new york for direct discount window borrowings that had  as of december   an approximate borrowing capacity based on pledged collateral of million 
in addition  the bank has in place additional borrowing capacity of million through correspondent banks 
at december   the bank had aggregate available and unused credit of million  which represents the aforementioned facilities totaling million net of million in outstanding borrowings 
at december  outstanding commitments for the bank to extend credit were million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the following table shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments  as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands standby letters of credit commitments under standby letters of credit  both financial and performance  do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon

contractual obligation total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations federal home loan bank borrowings operating leases represent obligations entered into by the company for the use of land  premises and equipment 
the leases generally have escalation terms based upon certain defined indexes 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  and capital and liquidity requirements  establish prudent asset concentration guidelines  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates  and actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability committee the alco 
the alco generally reviews the company s liquidity  cash flow needs  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  and current market conditions and interest rates 
the company currently utilizes net interest income simulation and economic value of portfolio equity evpe models to measure the potential impact to the company of future changes in interest rates 
as of december  and the results of the models were within guidelines prescribed by the company s board of directors 
if model results were to fall outside prescribed ranges  action would be required by the alco 
the net interest income simulation model attempts to measure the change in net interest income over the next one year period assuming certain changes in the general level of interest rates 
in our model  which was run as of december   we estimated that a gradual often referred to as ramped basis point increase in the general level of interest rates will increase our net interest income by  while a ramped basis point decrease in interest rates will decrease net interest income by 
as of december   our model predicted that a basis point ramped increase in general interest rates would increase net interest income by  while a basis point decrease would decrease net interest income by 
an evpe analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with rate shocks of up and down basis points 
the economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change 
the company s variance in evpe as a percentage of assets as of december   was with a rate shock of up basis points  and with a rate shock of down basis points 
at december   the variances were assuming an up basis points rate shock and assuming a down basis points rate shock 
capital a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base 
the bank s federal regulators have classified and defined capital into the following components tier i capital  which includes tangible stockholders equity for common stock  qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying hybrid instruments  and tier ii capital  which includes a portion of the allowance for probable loan losses  certain qualifying long term debt  and preferred stock which does not qualify for tier i capital 
minimum capital levels are regulated by risk based capital adequacy guidelines which require certain capital as a percent of the bank s assets and certain off balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
a bank is required to maintain  at a minimum  tier i capital as a percentage of risk adjusted assets of and combined tier i and tier ii capital as a percentage of risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  the bank s regulators require that an institution which meets the regulator s highest performance and operation standards maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percentage of average tangible assets of 
for those institutions with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating significant growth  the minimum leverage ratio will be evaluated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
the following table summarizes the risk based and leverage capital ratios for the bank as well as the required minimum regulatory capital ratios at december  actual ratio minimum requirement well capitalized requirement somerset hills bank total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio at december  actual ratio minimum requirement well capitalized requirement somerset hills bank total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio the company s tangible common equity ratio was as of december  and as of december  borrowings as an additional source of liquidity  we use advances from the federal home loan bank of new york 
the company had outstanding advances at december  as follows maturity rate amount november  january  january  february  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards  please see note to the company s consolidated financial statements
