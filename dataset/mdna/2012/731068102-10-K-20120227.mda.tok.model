the overall north american powersports industry was about flat year over year  a positive trend for the industry compared to the past several years 
our full year north american retail sales were up  helping to drive total company sales to a record billion in  up percent from sales growth remained broad based  as sales grew in every product line and in every region of the world

global market leadership is an attractive growth initiative in the company shorter term and our objective is to drive international business to generate at least percent of our sales within the next few years

revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer  distributor or other customers 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program  have not been material 
however  we have agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
our financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
we have not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
polaris sponsors certain sales incentive programs and accrues liabilities for estimated sales promotion expenses and estimated holdback amounts that are recognized as reductions to sales when products are sold to the dealer or distributor customer 
sales promotions and incentives we provide for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume incentives  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
we record these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from an increase in the volume of units sold 
actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  actual sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within our expectations and differences have not been material 

table of contents dealer holdback programs dealer holdback represents a portion of the invoiced sales price that is expected to be subsequently returned to the dealer or distributor as a sales incentive upon the ultimate retail sale of the product 
holdback amounts reduce the ultimate net price of the products purchased by our dealers or distributors and  therefore  reduce the amount of sales we recognize at the time of shipment 
the portion of the invoiced sales price estimated as the holdback is recognized as dealer holdback liability on our balance sheet until paid or forfeited 
the minimal holdback adjustments in the estimated holdback liability due to forfeitures are recognized in net sales 
payments are made to dealers or distributors at various times during the year subject to previously established criteria 
polaris recorded accrued liabilities of million and million for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
share based employee compensation we recognize in the financial statements the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the company utilizes historical volatility as it believes this is reflective of market conditions 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical exercise patterns 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history of dividend payouts 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if forfeiture adjustments are made  they would affect our gross margin and operating expenses 
we estimate the likelihood and the rate of achievement for performance sensitive share based awards  specifically long term compensation grants of long term incentive plan units and restricted stock 
changes in the estimated rate of achievement and fluctuation in the market based stock price can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation expenses as the effect of a change in the estimated achievement level and fluctuation in the market based stock price is recognized in the period that the likelihood factor and stock price changes 
if adjustments in the estimated rate of achievement and fluctuation in the market based stock price are made  they would be reflected in our gross margin and operating expenses 
product warranties we provide a limited warranty for orvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for our snowmobiles and motorcycles and two years for sevs 
we provide longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions and may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs 
our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumers 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
we record these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the accrued warranty liability was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
we self insure our product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
we utilize historical trends and actuarial analysis tools  along with an analysis of current claims  to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and  we had accruals of million and 
table of contents million  respectively  for the probable payment of pending claims related to product liability litigation associated with our products 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes the product liability reserves are adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
