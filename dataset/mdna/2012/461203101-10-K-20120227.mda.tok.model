however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements

existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts 
the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers

inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products  redesigning of existing products  new product introductions  market changes and safety issues 
both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet 
in general  invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions 
depending on the situation  the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item 
the company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts  increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products  and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market 
these initiatives are sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
under intangibles goodwill and other  asc i 
table of contents  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
the company s measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is october furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to review goodwill for impairment in accordance with asc  the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of the each reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
the company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments 
the company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
to estimate the fair values of the reporting units  the company utilizes a discounted cash flow method dcf in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth  profitability  inventory turns  days sales outstanding  etc 
to forecast future cash flows 
the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the year treasury rate for the risk free rate  a market risk premium  the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment 
the discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company s annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates 
the assumptions used are based on a market participant s point of view and yielded a discount rate of in for the company s annual impairment analysis compared to in and in the company also utilizes an ev enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their ev to ebitda multiples adjusted by an estimated premium 
while more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method  the ev to ebitda method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results 
the results of the company s step i annual impairment test indicated a potential impairment in the asia pacific segment 
as a result  the company completed a step ii impairment test for this segment 
pursuant to property  plant and equipment  asc  the company compared the forecasted un discounted cash flows of the asia pacific segment to the carrying value of the net assets  which indicated no impairment of any other long lived assets 
as part of the step ii test  the company calculated the fair value of all recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities to determine the goodwill impairment amount 
as a result of reduced profitability in the asia pacific segment in the fourth quarter of  uncertainty associated with future market conditions  and based on the step ii calculated results  the company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill in the asia pacific segment of  in the fourth quarter of  which represented the entire goodwill amount for the reporting unit 
in december  the fda requested that the company agree to a consent decree of injunction at the company s corporate facility and its wheelchair manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio  the proposed terms of which would require the suspension of certain operations at those facilities until they are certified by the company and then determined by the fda to be in compliance with fda quality system regulations 
the significant decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization  as occurred following the announcement of the consent decree  were considered by the company as indicators of possible impairment that required an interim assessment of goodwill for impairment 
the company believes the suspension of operations at its wheelchair manufacturing facility as required under the consent decree would primarily impact the company s na hme segment 
the company is in the process of negotiating with the fda on the terms of the consent decree 
as of december   the company updated the assumptions and variables in its dcf model in regards to the na hme segment and factored in a basis point risk premium to the discount rate used to reflect the increased uncertainty with the company s forecasted cash flows for the reporting unit 
the risk premium adjustment was calculated by the company by considering the decline in the company s stock price as well as the company s ebitda multiple 
the premium adjustment was made as the company was not able to produce a range of cash flows given the lack of clarity on the final terms of the consent decree 
the results of the calculation as of december  confirmed that the carrying value of the na hme reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
pursuant to asc  the company compared the forecasted un discounted cash flows of the na hme segment to the carrying value of the net assets  which indicated no impairment of any other long lived assets 
the company then conducted a preliminary step ii test in which the fair values of all recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities were calculated to determine the estimated impairment charge of  which represented the entire goodwill amount for the reporting unit 
the company expects to finalize the step ii analysis and record any adjustment in the first quarter of while there was no indication of impairment in related to goodwill for the europe  isg or ipg segments  a future potential impairment is possible for each or any of the company s segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis 
furthermore  the company s annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly 
for instance  higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment 
in consideration of this potential  the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were basis points higher for the impairment analysis and determined that i 
table of contents there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for the europe  isg or ipg segments 
the company s intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
defined lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists  developed technology  license agreements  patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non compete agreements 
the company s indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks 
the company evaluates the carrying value of definite lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
definite lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
actual impairment amounts for definite lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the company reviews indefinite lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
any impairment amounts for indefinite lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an intangible impairment charge of  in the ipg segment  the company recognized a  impairment related to a customer list which had a remaining life of five years 
in the na hme segment  a  impairment  representing the entire carrying value  was recognized related to a customer list which had a remaining life of seven years 
in the europe segment  a  indefinite lived trademark impairment was recognized as the calculated fair value was less than its carrying value 
in the asia pacific segment  a  impairment  representing the entire carrying value  was recognized related to intellectual property which had a remaining life of approximately years 
the fair value of the customer lists were calculated using an excess earnings method  using a discounted cash flow model 
estimated cash flow returns to the customer relationship were reduced by the cash flows required to satisfy the return requirements of each of the assets employed with the residual cash flow then discounted to value the customer relationship 
the fair value of the trademark was calculated using a relief from royalty payment methodology which requires applying an estimated market royalty rate to forecasted net sales and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
the intellectual properly intangible asset was impaired as the intellectual property was determined to be no longer viable and is no longer being used 
product liability the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance co  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring up to  in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits  as applicable

product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
warranty generally  the company s products are covered from the date of sale to the customer by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product 
certain components carry a lifetime warranty 
a provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience 
the company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed 
historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves 
claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed 
however  the company does consider other events  such as a product recall  which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision

income taxes as part of the process of preparing its financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating the company s current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
substantially all of the company s us and new zealand deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company does at times use interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on december  debt levels  a change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately  additionally  the company operates internationally and  as a result  is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
specifically  the exposure results from intercompany loans  intercompany sales or payments and third party sales or payments 
in an attempt to reduce this exposure  foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to hedge intercompany purchases and sales as well as third party purchases and sales 
the company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
