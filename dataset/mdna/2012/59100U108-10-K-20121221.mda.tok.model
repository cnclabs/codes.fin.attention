item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect the company s earnings  as the company s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing the company s loans decline 
the company s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  money supply and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect the company s asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the company s earnings 
because the company has a significant amount of real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
among other things  adverse changes in the economy  including but not limited to the current economic downturn  may also have a negative effect on the ability of the company s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
in addition  the vast majority of the company s loans are to individuals and businesses in the company s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in the company s market area could have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
recessionary environment may adversely impact the company s earnings and continuing and new governmental initiatives may not prove effective 
the national and global economic downturn has recently resulted in heightened levels of market volatility locally  nationally and internationally 
this downturn has depressed the overall market value of financial institutions  and may limit or impede industry access to capital  or have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of banking companies in general  including the company  with respect to  for example  the establishment of reserves should conditions deteriorate further 
although the us department of the treasury and the fdic  among others  implemented programs in an effort to stabilize the national economy  the ultimate effectiveness of these programs remains uncertain at this time 
further  failure of the us congress to address the expanding national deficit  as well as problems associated with sovereign debt in europe  may worsen the us economy  both nationally and locally  causing an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s earnings depend substantially on the company s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates we earn on loans  securities and other earning assets  and ii the interest rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
as market interest rates rise  we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits  which may result in a decrease of the company s net interest income 
conversely  if interest rates fall  yields on loans and investments may fall 
because a significant portion of the company s deposit portfolio is in non interest bearing accounts  such a decrease in rates would likely result in a decrease in the company s net interest income 
although the bank continues to monitor its interest rate risk exposure and has undertaken additional analyses and implemented additional controls to improve its core earnings from interest income  the bank can provide no assurance that its efforts will appropriately protect the bank in the future from interest rate risk exposure

table of contents the company operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company and the bank operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  the fdic and the federal reserve 
as of july   the company has been supervised by the federal reserve  and the bank has been supervised by the occ and the fdic 
see item business regulation herein 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to regulations promulgated by the bureau 
applicable laws and regulations may change and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations may vary when actions are evaluated by these new regulators  and there is no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect the company s business 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  legislation  or the evaluation of the bank s and the company s efforts with respect to achieving compliance with the consent orders  could have a material impact on the company s operations 
it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted  or the effect that such passage or adoption will have on the banking industry or the company 
changes in technology could be costly 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  the company needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
this is especially true with respect to mps 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  has been high in both absolute and relative terms and additional funds continue to be used to enhance existing management information systems 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that the company s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of the company 
risks related to the company s business the entry into the consent orders has imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon the company and the bank and we cannot predict the possibility of future regulatory action 
satisfaction of the requirements of the orders is subject to the ongoing review and supervision of the occ with respect to the bank and the federal reserve with respect to the company 
the bank and the company have and expect to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address areas that were cited in the orders  such matters include but are not limited to capital preservation and enhancement commensurate with the bank s risk profile  improvement of core earnings from interest income  management and board oversight of the bank  risk management and internal controls  compliance management  and bank secrecy act compliance 

table of contents there can be no assurance that our regulators will ultimately determine that we have met all of the requirements of the orders to their satisfaction 
if our regulators believe that we have not made sufficient progress in complying with the orders  they could seek to impose additional regulatory requirements  operational restrictions  enhanced supervision and or civil money penalties 
if any of these measures is imposed in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to raise additional capital

for additional information with respect to certain risks related to the mps division specifically  see risk factors risks related to meta payment systems  a division of the bank 
the compliance obligations and restrictions on our interest payments and dividends under the recent ots consent orders may have an adverse effect on us and preclude payments to holders of our securities 
among other things  the consent orders require the company and bank to submit to the ots now  the occ or the federal reserve  as appropriate various management and compliance plans and programs to address the matters initially identified in the ots supervisory directives as well as plans for enhancing company and bank capital  and require ots non objection for company cash dividends  distributions  share repurchases  payments of interest or principal on debt and incurrence of debt 
as indicated  satisfaction of the requirements of the orders is subject to the ongoing review and supervision of our regulators 
there can be no assurance our regulators will ultimately determine that we have met all of the requirements of the orders to their satisfaction or that we will continue to receive non objection to our payment of dividends and interest or any other activity for which non objection or approval is required 
additional resources  both economic and in terms of personnel  will continue to be expended by the company and the bank in their endeavors to achieve compliance 
see business regulation bank supervision and regulation ots consent orders and related matters which is included in item of this annual report on form k 
the occ and federal reserve are now our banking regulators and we may not be able to comply with applicable banking regulations and the terms of the consent orders to their satisfaction 
our new regulators have broad discretionary powers to enforce banking laws and regulations and may seek to take informal or formal supervisory action if they deem such actions are necessary or required or if they believe that our efforts with respect to the consent orders are insufficient 
if imposed in the future  corrective steps could result in additional regulatory requirements  operational restrictions  enhanced supervision and or civil money penalties 
additional resources  both economic and in terms of personnel  will continue to be expended by the company and the bank in their endeavors to achieve full compliance 
the company operates in an extremely competitive market  and the company s business will suffer if it is unable to compete effectively 
the company encounters significant competition in the company s market area from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services that the company does not or cannot provide 
the company s profitability depends upon the company s continued ability to compete successfully in the company s market area 
mps operates on a national scale against competitors with substantially greater resources and limited barriers to entry  as well as the fact that most competitors are not operating under restrictions similar to those imposed upon the company and the bank in the consent orders 
the success of mps depends upon the company s and the bank s ability to satisfy the requirements set forth in their respective consent orders and the mps division s ability to compete in such an environment 

table of contents the bank is well capitalized under existing bank regulations  but failure to maintain this designation could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  our regulator could limit our ability to raise deposits  which could produce serious adverse consequences for our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
by letter dated december   the ots directed the bank not to increase the amount of brokered deposits from the amount it held at december  without the prior written non objection of the ots regional director 
the bank believes it did not hold any brokered deposits on december  or thereafter and so informed ots of such position 
consequently  the bank does not anticipate seeking such approval 
at the direction of the ots  the bank requested the fdic to confirm that deposits related to a specific prepaid program were not brokered deposits 
the bank tendered its request to the fdic in december at the time the directive was issued  ots staff stated that it would not seek retroactively to enforce the directive for any growth that occurs subsequent to december   given the bank s request to the fdic 
the bank has been advised that the fdic would consider the bank s request in the context of its now completed broader industry study of brokered deposits in general  but to date has been given no instruction to change its position 
under current rules  if a substantial portion of the bank s deposits are ruled to be brokered  and should the bank s primary federal regulator decide to impose a formal individual minimum capital requirement or similar formal requirement on the bank notwithstanding that the bank is well capitalized  or should the bank fail to be well capitalized in the future  the bank would be prohibited  absent waiver from the fdic  from utilizing brokered deposits 
in such event  unless the bank receives relief from its regulator or a waiver from the fdic  such a result could produce serious adverse consequences for the bank from a liquidity standpoint and could also have serious adverse effects on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant percentage of our deposits  total assets and income from deposit accounts that we generate through mps s customer relationships 
we derive a significant percentage of our deposits  total assets and income from deposit accounts we generate through customer relationships between such third parties and mps 
deposits related to our top three customers each  a significant customer totaled million at september  we provide oversight and auditing of such third party relationships and all such relationships must meet all internal and regulatory requirements 
we may exit these relationships if such requirements are not met or if required to do so by our regulators 
we perform liquidity reporting and planning daily and identify and monitor contingent sources of liquidity  such as national cds  fed fund lines  or public fund cds 
if one of these significant customers were to be terminated  it could materially reduce our deposits  assets and income 
in addition  pursuant to the bank s consent order  if one of these relationships were to terminate before the termination of the consent order  we would not be able to replace such relationship without first identifying a new contracting party and then obtaining approval to enter into such agreement from the occ 
if such significant customer was not replaced  we may be required to seek higher rate funding sources as compared to the existing customer and interest expense might increase 
we may also be required to sell securities or other assets which would reduce revenues and potentially generate losses 
our business strategy is utilized by other institutions with which we compete and the consent orders prevent us from actively marketing the bank s products and services 
several banking institutions have adopted business goals that are similar to ours  particularly with respect to the mps division 
as a consequence  we have encountered competition in this area and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
this competition may increase our costs  reduce our revenues or revenue growth  or make it difficult for us to compete effectively in obtaining additional customer relationships 
in addition  pursuant to the consent orders  we are not allowed to enter into or materially amend certain agreements  originate certain loans  or offer certain services unless we are granted specific permission to do so  or until the terms of the consent orders are rescinded 
as a result  until the terms of the consent orders are lifted  we are at a competitive disadvantage with respect to growing the bank s mps division 
see business regulation bank supervision and regulation ots consent orders and related matters which is included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  to the extent permitted under the terms of the consent orders  we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with developing and marketing new lines of business or new products or services  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed  and we may be required to invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses existing insurance policies may not adequately protect the company and its subsidiaries 
fidelity  business interruption and property insurance policies are in place with respect to the operations of the company 
should any event triggering such policies occur  however  it is possible that our policies would not fully reimburse us for the losses we could sustain due to deductible limits  policy limits  coverage limits or other factors 
the loss of key members of the company s senior management team could adversely affect the company s business 
we believe that the company s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of the company s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of the company s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect the company s business 
the company s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
the company originates commercial mortgage loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans and residential mortgage loans 
commercial mortgage  commercial  and consumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial mortgage loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 

table of contents commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either the bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates  among others 
if the company s actual loan losses exceed the company s allowance for loan losses  the company s net income will decrease 
the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of the company s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of the company s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of the company s loans 
despite the company s underwriting and monitoring practices  the company s loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms  and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
the company may experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
because the company must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  the current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
the company may need to significantly increase the company s provision for losses on loans if one or more of the company s larger loans or credit relationships becomes impaired or if we continue to expand the company s commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to increase the company s provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to the company s allowance would materially decrease the company s net income 
the company cannot assure you that its monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that the company s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
if the company forecloses on and takes ownership of real estate collateral property  it may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
the company may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect its investment and may thereafter own and operate such property 
in such case  the company will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that the company  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of the company s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi supply of and demand for rental units or properties  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating a real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property  and the company may have to advance funds in order to protect the company s investment  or may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect the company s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 

table of contents our agricultural loans are subject to factors beyond the bank s control 
the agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations 
although our agricultural loans are a relatively limited part of our overall portfolio  extended periods of low commodity prices  higher input costs  or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins  reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture related businesses  which in turn  could affect other businesses in the company s market area 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the course of the company s business  it may acquire  through foreclosure  commercial properties securing loans that are in default 
there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on those properties 
in this event  the company could be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at its own cost and expense 
the cost of removal and environmental remediation could be substantial 
the company may not have adequate remedies against the owners of the properties or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties 
these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
if the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  it may not be able to accurately report the company s financial results or prevent fraud  and  as a result  investors and depositors could lose confidence in the company s financial reporting  which could adversely affect the company s business  the trading price of the company s stock and the company s ability to attract additional deposits 
in recent years  the company has been required to include in its annual reports filed with the sec a report of the company s management regarding internal control over financial reporting 
we have documented and evaluated the company s internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and sec rules and regulations  which require an annual management report on the company s internal control over financial reporting  including  among other matters  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to comply with this requirement  management retained outside consultants to assist the company in i assessing and documenting the adequacy of the company s internal control over financial reporting  ii improving control processes  where appropriate  and iii verifying through testing or other means that controls are functioning as documented 
management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting is contained in item a below 
if the company fails to identify and correct any significant deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting or fails to prevent fraud  current and potential stockholders and depositors could lose confidence in the company s financial reporting  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  the trading price of the company s stock  and the company s ability to attract additional deposits 
no material weaknesses have been identified in connection with the company s fiscal year audit 
if material weaknesses are identified in the future  such weaknesses could have a material impact on the profitability and performance of the company 
our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us 
our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us 
we have established processes and procedures intended to identify  measure  monitor  report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject  including liquidity risk  credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk  operational risk  legal and compliance risk  and reputational risk  among others 
however  as with any risk management framework  there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist  or develop in the future  risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified 
for example  the recent financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and certain limitations of managing unanticipated risks 
if our risk management framework proves ineffective  we could suffer unexpected losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of the company s agents or vendors could negatively affect the company s reputation and business 
the company depends on data processing  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet 
despite safeguards  no system  including ours  is entirely free from vulnerability to attack 
additionally  the company relies on and does business with a variety of third party service providers  agents and vendors with respect to the company s business  data and communications needs 
if information security is breached  or one of the company s agents or vendors breaches compliance procedures  information could be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to the company or damages to others 
these costs or losses could materially exceed the company s amount of insurance coverage  if any  which would adversely affect the company s business 
changes in accounting policies or accounting standards  or changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied  could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 
our accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results 
any changes in our accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb  the sec  banking regulators and our outside auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control  can be difficult to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 
we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently and retroactively  which may result in the company being required to restate prior period financial statements in material amounts 
risks related to the company s stock the price of the company s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
the market price for shares of the company s common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s results of operations  sales of substantial amounts of the company s securities into the marketplace  
table of contents general conditions in the company s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  lack of an active trading market for the common stock  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  the company s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects  and negative evaluation by our regulators of our compliance with our orders 
the market price of the company s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the company s performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices 
an investment in company common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and is subject to market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you hold or acquire our common stock  it is possible that you may lose all or a portion of your investment 
the company s common stock is thinly traded  and thus your ability to sell shares or purchase additional shares of the company s common stock will be limited  and the market price at any time may not reflect true value 
your ability to sell shares of the company s common stock or purchase additional shares largely depends upon the existence of an active market for the common stock 
the company s common stock is quoted on nasdaq global market  but the volume of trades on any given day is light  and you may be unable to find a buyer for shares you wish to sell or a seller of additional shares you wish to purchase 
in addition  a fair valuation of the purchase or sales price of a share of common stock also depends upon active trading  and thus the price you receive for a thinly traded stock  such as the company s common stock  may not reflect its true value 
future sales or additional issuances of the company s capital stock may depress prices of shares of the company s common stock or otherwise dilute the book value of shares then outstanding 
sales of a substantial amount of the company s capital stock in the public market or the issuance of a significant number of shares could adversely affect the market price for shares of the company s common stock 
as of september   the company was authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock  of which  shares were outstanding  and  shares were held as treasury stock 
the company was also authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  none of which is outstanding or reserved for issuance 
this factor may affect the market price for shares of the company s common stock 

table of contents federal regulations may inhibit a takeover  prevent a transaction you may favor or limit the company s growth opportunities  which could cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline 
certain provisions of the company s charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
in addition  the company must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before it can acquire control of any other company 
the company may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
the company pays a quarterly dividend to stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions as well as a requirement for prior approval by the federal reserve pursuant to the consent orders 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on the company s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  regulatory review  and other factors considered relevant by the company s board of directors 
risks related to meta payment systems  a division of the bank mps products and services are highly regulated financial products subject to extensive supervision and regulation and are costly to maintain 
the products and services offered by mps are highly regulated by federal banking agencies  the bureau  state banking agencies  and other federal and state regulators 
some of the laws and related regulations affecting its operations include consumer protection laws  escheat laws  privacy laws  anti money laundering laws and data protection laws 
compliance with the relevant legal paradigm in which the division operates is costly and requires significant personnel resources  as well as extensive contacts with outside lawyers and consultants hired by mps to stay abreast of the applicable regulatory schemes 
in addition  bank talent and resources have been diverted since the signing of the consent order in an effort to achieve compliance with certain components of the consent order that implicate the operations of mps 
areas the bank must continue to address include  but are not limited to  ongoing oversight of mps by the board and management 
efforts to satisfy the requirements of the bank s consent order continue to be costly  both in economic terms and in terms of personnel resources 
as described elsewhere herein  satisfaction of the requirements of the bank s consent order is subject to the ongoing review of its regulator and there can be no assurance that the bank will fully satisfy such requirements 
if our regulators believe that the company or the bank has not made sufficient progress in satisfying the requirements of the consent orders  such regulators could take further supervisory action against the bank or the company 
if taken  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the mps division segment  the bank  and the company and limit our ability to raise additional capital 
the dodd frank act s restrictions with respect to the cap on debit card interchange could negatively affect the bank s business 
on june   the federal reserve issued a rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions the debit card rule 
the issuance of the debit card rule was required by the dodd frank act 
pursuant to the debit card rule  the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 
the federal reserve also approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward adjustment of no more than to an issuer s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud prevention standards set out in the interim final rule 
eligibility for the assessment of this fee must be certified by the issuing bank 
as set forth in the issuing release  when the maximum interchange fee is combined with fraud prevention assessment  an issuing bank could receive an interchange fee of up to approximately cents for the average debit card transaction  which is valued at according to the federal reserve 
in accordance with the provisions of the dodd frank act  issuers that  together with their affiliates  have assets of less than billion like the bank are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards 
with respect to network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions  it is now required that all debit cards participate in at least two unaffiliated networks so that the transactions initiated using those debit cards will have at least two independent routing channels 

table of contents while some proposed legislation would benefit mps  it is possible that new legislation or more stringent focus by banking agencies could further restrict mps current operations or change the regulatory environment in which the division s customers operate 
although it is possible that some legislation under consideration could have either a positive or de minimis impact on its operations and profitability it is also possible that any new legislation affecting the operations of mps or its customers  some of which are also regulated entities  would have a negative impact on the conduct of the relevant business 
there is no way to quantify the impact that such changes could have on the profitability or operations of mps at this time given the unpredictable nature of the risk 
in addition to the relevant legal paradigm set forth above  it should also be noted that there has been concern within the bank regulatory environment over the use of credit and  in particular  prepaid cards as a means by which to illegally launder and move money 
the us treasury s financial crimes enforcement network has recently issued rules related to providers of prepaid access which have left certain issues unresolved related to its regulatory requirements 
moreover  the bureau held a town hall meeting on prepaid products in raleigh  north carolina in may to hear testimony from witnesses who provided their views on prepaid products and to issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking  which permitted the public to comment on issues related to the prepaid market 
as of the date of this filing  the bureau has not issued any additional proposed or final rules related to mps and the products and services it offers  however  given that additional regulation appears likely in this area  it is also likely that our costs related to compliance will increase when such regulations are finalized 
although the bank will continue to work with its regulators to provide information about its operations as well as the state of the prepaid card industry  we believe such concerns in general will continue for the foreseeable future for the entire banking industry  with a continued emphasis on heightened compliance expectations  resulting in higher compliance costs

mps  through the bank  owns or is seeking a number of patents  trademarks and other forms of intellectual property with respect to the operation of its business and the protection of such intellectual property may in the future require material expenditures 
in its operations  mps  through the bank  is seeking protection for various forms of intellectual property 
no assurance can be given that such protection will be granted 
in addition  given the competitive market environment of its business  the bank must be vigilant in ensuring that its patents and other intellectual property are protected and not exploited by unlicensed third parties 

table of contents the bank must also protect itself and defend against intellectual property challenges initiated by third parties making various claims against mps 
with respect to these claims  regardless of whether we are pursuing our claims against perceived infringers or defending our intellectual property from third parties asserting various claims of infringement  it is possible that significant personnel time and monetary resources could be used to pursue or defend such claims 
it should also be noted that intellectual property risks extend to foreign countries whose protections of such property are not as extensive as those in the united states 
as such  mps may need to spend additional sums to ensure that its intellectual property protections are maximized globally 
moreover  should there be a material  improper use of the bank s intellectual property  this could have an impact on the division s operations 
contracts with third parties  some of which are material to the company  may not be renewed  may be renegotiated on terms that are not as favorable  may not be fulfilled or could be subject to cancellation by regulatory authorities 
the bank has entered into numerous contracts with third parties with respect to the operations of its business 
in some instances  the third parties provide services to mps  in other instances  mps provides products and services to such third parties 
were such agreements not to be renewed by the third party or were such agreements to be renewed on terms less favorable  such actions could have a material impact on the division s profitability and deposit levels 
similarly  were one of these parties unable to meet their obligations to us for any reason including but not limited to bankruptcy  computer or other technological interruptions or failures  personnel loss or acts of god  we may need to seek alternative service providers and the terms with such alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place 
in addition  were such failures to cause a material disruption in our ability to service our customers  it is possible that our customer base would shrink 
moreover  were the disruptions in our ability to provide services significant  this could negatively affect the perception of our business in the card industry  which could result in a loss of confidence and adverse effects on our own business 
in addition  as described earlier  in the consent orders our regulator noted deficiencies with respect to these third party relationships 
as a result  we review our auditing program for third parties with whom we contract as well as other business changes required both by the consent orders and general business practices and have made certain business decisions related to determinations reached by our auditing personnel 
the occ is evaluating our progress at this time 
if we are unsuccessful in the development and or implementation of our third party auditing program  it is possible that the occ could order us to abrogate certain contracts or take other supervisory actions against us which would further impact the mps business  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations

costs of conforming products and services to the payment card industry data security standards the pci dss are costly and could continue to affect the operations of mps 
the pci dss is a multifaceted standard that includes data security management  policies and procedures as well as other protective measures  that was created by the largest credit card associations in the world in an effort to protect the nonpublic personal information of all types of cardholders  including prepaid cardholders and holders of network branded credit cards such as discover  mastercard  and visa 
the pci dss mandates a prescribed technical foundation for the collection  storage and transmission of cardholder data and also contains significant provisions regarding the testing of security protections by various entities in the payment card industry  including mps 
compliance with the pci dss is costly and changes to the standards could have an equal  or greater  effect on profitability of the relevant business division 

table of contents the potential for fraud in the card payment industry is significant 
issuers of prepaid and credit cards have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of cardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain 
the theft of such information is regularly reported and affects not only individuals but businesses as well albeit to a lesser degree 
many types of credit card fraud exist  including the counterfeiting of cards and skimming 
skimming is the term for a specialized type of credit card information theft whereby  typically  an employee of a merchant will copy the cardholder s number and security code either by handwriting the information onto a piece of paper  entering such information into a keypad or other device  or using a handheld device which reads and then stores the card information embedded in the magnetic strip 
once a credit card number and security code has been skimmed  the skimmer can use such information for purchases until the unauthorized use is detected either by the cardholder or the card issuer 
losses from skimming have been substantial for certain card industry participants 
although skimming has not had a material impact on the profitability of the bank  it is possible that such activity could impact this division at some time in the future 
part of our business depends on sales agents who do not sell our products exclusively 
our business model  to some degree  depends upon the use of sales agents who are not our employees 
these agents sell the products and services of many different processors to merchants and other parties in need of card services 
failure to maintain good relations with such sales agents could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  new third party relationships have been restricted absent prior approval of the occ

products and services offered by mps involve many business parties and the possibility of collusion exists 
as described above  the theft of cardholder data is a significant threat in the industry in which mps operates 
this threat also includes the possibility that there is collusion between certain participants in the card system to act illegally 
although mps is not aware of any instances to date  it is possible that such activities could occur in the future  thereby impacting its operation and profitability 
competition in the card industry is significant 
in order to maintain an edge to its products and offerings  mps must invest significantly in technology and research and development 
the heavy emphasis upon technology in the products and services offered by mps requires significant expenditures with respect to research and development both to exploit technological gains and to develop new products and services to meet customers needs 
as is common with most research and development  while some efforts may yield substantial benefits for the division  others will not  thereby resulting in expenditures for which profits will not be realized 
mps is not able to predict with any degree of certainty as to the level of research and development that will be required in the future  how much those efforts will cost  or how profitable such developments will be for the division once undertaken 

table of contents our business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards or there are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general 
as the prepaid financial services industry evolves  consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than other financial services 
consumers might not use prepaid financial services for any number of reasons 
for example  negative publicity surrounding other prepaid financial service providers could impact mps business and prospects for growth to the extent it adversely impacts the perception of prepaid financial services 
if consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards  mps operating revenues may remain at current levels or decline 
growth of prepaid financial services as an electronic payment mechanism may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated 
if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms used by consumers ie  cash  credit cards  traditional debit cards and prepaid cards away from products and services offered by mps  such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the bureau is closely monitoring developments in the prepaid card industry and it is possible that future regulation by the bureau  whether by rule or administrative action  could adversely affect our business 
discover  mastercard  and visa  as well as other electronic funds networks in which mps operates  could change their rules 
pursuant to the agreements between mps and discover  mastercard  visa and other card networks  these third parties typically have retained the right to prescribe certain business practices and procedures with respect to parties such as mps 
such prescribed terms include  but are not limited to  a contracting party s level of capital as well as other business requirements 
discover  mastercard  and visa also retain the right in their agreements with industry participants such as mps to unilaterally change the rules under which such transactions are processed with little or no advance warning 
this power includes the power to prevent mps from accessing their networks in order to process transactions 
should any third party choose to invoke this right unilaterally  such changes could materially impact the operations of mps 
our business is heavily dependent upon the internet and any negative disruptions to its operation could negatively impact our business 
much of our business depends upon transactions being processed through the internet 
like nearly all other commercial enterprises  we rely upon others to provide the internet so that commerce can be conducted 
were there to be a failure in the operation of the internet or a significant impairment in our ability to move information on the internet or our ability to do so in accordance with customer safeguard protocols  mps would develop alternative processes during which time revenues and profitability may be lower 
our ability to process transactions requires functioning communication and electricity lines 
the nature of the credit card and debit card industry is that it must be operational every day of the week every hour of the week 
any disruption in the utilities utilized by mps could have a negative effect on our operations and extensive disruptions could materially affect our operations 
data encryption technology has not been perfected and vigilance in mps information technology systems is costly 
mps holds sensitive business and personal information with respect to the products and services it offers 
this information  which is generally digitally encrypted  is passed along various technology channels  including the internet 
although mps encrypts its customer and other sensitive information and expends significant financial and personnel resources to maintain the integrity of its technology networks and the confidentiality of nonpublic customer information  because such information may travel on public technology and other non secure channels  the confidential information is potentially susceptible to hacking and other illegal intrusions 
were such a security breach to occur  the provision of products and services to customers of mps would be impaired 
in addition  were a breach to occur  we could incur significant fines from the electronic funds associations involved  or from federal and or state regulators  and be subject to other prohibitions  as well as extensive litigation from commercial parties and consumers affected by such breach 

table of contents unclaimed funds represented by unused value on the cards presents compliance and other risks 
the concept of escheatment involves the reporting and delivery of property to states that is abandoned and its rightful owner cannot be readily located and or identified 
in the context of prepaid cards  the funds in connection with such cards can sometimes be abandoned or unused for the relevant period of time set forth in each applicable state s abandoned property laws 
although mps utilizes automated programs to ensure its operations are compliant with such applicable laws and regulations  there appears to be a movement among some state regulators to interpret definitions in those statutes and regulations in a manner that is different from standard industry interpretations 
should such state regulators choose to do so  they may initiate collection or other litigation action against prepaid card issuers such as mps for unreported abandoned property 
mps operates in a highly competitive environment and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel may be difficult 
mps competes in a highly competitive environment with other larger and better capitalized financial intermediaries 
in addition  the field of professionals involved in the design and production of products and services offered by mps is highly skilled and actively sought after by financial institutions  electronic card networks and other commercial entities 
as such  mps must spend significant sums to attract employees and executives and must monitor compensation and other employment trends to ensure that compensation packages both foster the necessary creative environment and appropriately compensate such individuals in order to retain them 
mps revenue concentration 
mps works with a large number of business partners to derive its revenue 
the company believes four of its partners have reached a size that  should these partners business with the company end or there is a significant decrease in revenues associated with any of these business relationships  the earnings attributable to them would have a material effect on the financial results of the company
