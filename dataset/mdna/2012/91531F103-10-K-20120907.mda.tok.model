item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed in the risk factor section contained above in item a 
since our inception in  unwired planet and its predecessor companies have invested in and patented certain intellectual property for the mobile internet industry  some of which we believe are foundational in allowing mobile devices to connect to the internet 
on january   we announced our pursuit of strategic alternatives for our product operations 
on february   we announced the sale of our location product operations to persistent systems for a purchase price of million 
on april   we sold the mediation and messaging product operations to openwave mobility for a 
table of contents purchase price of million 
we accounted for the sale of the location product line and the sale of the mediation and messaging product lines as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the condensed consolidated financial statements have been revised for all periods presented to reflect the location  mediation and messaging businesses as discontinued operations 
unless noted otherwise  the following discussions pertain to our continuing operations 
the pursuit of strategic alternatives was designed to allow us to focus on realizing the value of our intellectual property 
for example  on august   we announced we had filed complaints against apple inc and research in motion limited in order to protect our intellectual property pertaining to how mobile devices connect to the internet 
this litigation is ongoing 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a license agreement with a third party whereby we licensed rights to all of our patents for a fee of million which was received during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal we licensed a number of patents to a competitor which generated million in patent revenue for the period 
as we execute our licensing plans  we anticipate the related revenue in future periods to be unpredictable and volatile 
additionally  legal costs associated with our efforts to license and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be material in any given period  and are unpredictable and volatile 
effectively policing and enforcing our intellectual property is time consuming and costly 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any ongoing or future litigation will be successful 
critical accounting policies and judgments we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for our future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgment and estimates 
these significant accounting policies are classification among continuing and discontinued operations  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  valuation of investments  and restructuring related assessments 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
classification among continuing and discontinued operations due to the sale of our remaining product businesses in  we have presented financial results for the product businesses in discontinued operations 
as the majority of costs related to employees and operations in the past related to our product operations  we identified costs we considered to be related to the ongoing intellectual property business for presentation in continuing operations 
costs we identified as relating to continuing operations include costs related to all personnel dedicated to our patent initiatives  including external legal fees and support personnel 
additionally  certain general and administrative costs were included  which are equivalent to the resources we expect to have on an ongoing basis after our transition to an intellectual property business 
this includes costs related to our ceo and cfo  as well as accounting  information systems  and support personnel 
all compensation  benefits  stock based compensation and restructuring costs  if any  associated with these positions were included in ongoing operations 
additionally  we included costs related to being a public company  such as external audit costs  
table of contents costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act  board of directors fees  sec filings and nasdaq fees 
facilities and information technology costs were allocated based upon the percentage of headcount of the employees assumed to be working primarily for the intellectual property business 
restructuring costs related to facilities remained in continuing operations  as we have retained the related liabilities 
all other historical costs were classified as discontinued operations as they were considered necessary to support the product business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
to date  revenue from upfront payments from licensees for the licensing of our patents has been recognized when the arrangement is mutually signed  since there has been no delivery or future performance obligation and the other three criteria are met upon signing the arrangement 
when patent licensing arrangements include royalties for future sales of the licensees products using our licensed patented technology  revenue is recognized when the royalty report is received from the licensee  at which time the fixed and determinable criteria is met 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is recorded utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance  which requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility was based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price  as well as implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock when appropriate 
during fiscal  and  implied volatility was not utilized in our valuation of options granted due to the lack of option contracts with a strike price similar to our stock option grants 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
our expected term of options granted is derived from actual post vesting option cancellation and exercise experience  as well as the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term for outstanding options 
valuation of investments as of june  and june   million and million  respectively  in auction rate securities ars  recorded in long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet  were considered illiquid based upon lack of recent auction results 
we estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities based on financial standing of the issuer  size of position held and the liquidity of the market  contractual restrictions on disposition  pending public offering with respect to the financial instrument  pending reorganization activity affecting the financial instrument  reported prices and the extent of the public trading in similar financial instruments of the issuer or comparable companies  ability of the issuer to obtain required financing  changes in the economic conditions affecting the issuer  a recent purchase of the sale of a security of the issuer  pricing by other dealers in similar securities  financial statements of any underlying ars portfolio investments  successful auction early redemption  failing auctions until maturity  or default and the estimated cash flows for each scenario 
other factors are considered  such as interest rate effects  liquidity  trinomial probabilities  recovery rates  value of the investments held by the issuer and the financial condition and credit ratings of the issuer  insurers  and parent companies  as applicable 
assumptions of probabilities of default  probabilities of passing auction  
table of contents and probabilities of earning the maximum rate for each period are based upon the risks  the underlying investments collateralizing the ars  the maturity date of the ars  the maximum rate of the ars and current market conditions  and third party professional judgment 
we recorded other than temporary and realized losses in the consolidated statements of operations of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  related to these securities 
there were no other than temporary and realized losses in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal restructuring related assessments our critical accounting policy and judgment as it relates to restructuring related assessments includes our estimate of facility costs 
to determine the facility costs  which consist of the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building  some estimates were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant  sublease terms  and sublease rates  including common area charges 
the facility cost is an estimate that may be adjusted in the future upon triggering events such as changes in estimates of time and rates to sublease  based upon current market conditions  or changes in actual sublease rates 
summary of operating results for fiscal  and revenues we generate patent revenue  which is derived from licensing our intellectual property

income taxes income tax benefit expense totaled million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
there was no income tax benefit expense related to continuing operations in fiscal income taxes in all periods consisted of us federal and state income taxes 
fiscal tax expense was million lower than the prior year primarily due to recording a tax benefit from continuing operations in fiscal as a result of the gain on sale of discontinued operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we have operated internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
with the disposition of our product businesses as of april   we expect to have a significantly reduced exposure to foreign currency rate changes 
prior to april   we had entered into foreign exchange derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on receivables  payables and intercompany balances denominated in a nonfunctional currency 
the objective of these derivatives was to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
these derivatives may require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with the gains and losses of the foreign exchange forward contracts
