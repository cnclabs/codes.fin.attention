investments we generate income by investing funds in excess of those retained for claims paying obligations and insurance operations 
we conduct these investment activities through each of the insurance entities and uih 
we may retain investment advisors to advise us or manage portions of our overall investment portfolio 
management reports overall investment results to our board of directors  at least on a quarterly basis 
we have and expect to continue to actively trade investment securities and other investments to supplement income derived from our insurance operations 
our investment strategy seeks primarily to maximize after tax investment income  and to obtain favorable risk adjusted real after tax investment returns to achieve long term growth of the insurance entities statutory surplus and consolidated stockholders equity 
the investment activities of the insurance entities are subject to regulation and supervision by the oir 
see government regulation and initiatives below 
the insurance entities may only make investments that are consistent with regulatory guidelines  and our investment policies for the insurance entities correspondingly limit the amount of investment in  among other things  non investment grade fixed maturity securities including high yield bonds and total investments in preferred stock and common stock 
while we seek to appropriately limit the size and scope of investments in the uih portfolio  uih is not similarly restricted by florida law 
therefore  the investments made by uih may significantly differ from those made by the insurance entities 
we do not purchase securities on margin 
as of december   approximately of our trading portfolio is held by our insurance entities and is held by uih 
we monitor the quality of investments  duration  sector mix and actual and expected investment returns 
in addition to compliance with florida law and regulatory guidelines  investment decision making is guided in part by general economic conditions as well as management s projections of cash flows  including the nature and timing of our expected claims payouts in the ordinary course of business and the possibility that we may have unexpected cash demands 
we expect that our investment portfolio will consist primarily of domestic  and to a lesser degree foreign  debt and equity securities including exchange traded funds etfs and mutual funds 
table of contents and  to a much lesser degree  non hedging derivative securities and physically held precious metals 
however  we may  subject to florida regulations  when applicable  invest a portion of our funds in other asset types  including  without limitation  options  hedging strategies and real estate assets 
the composition of our investment portfolio will change due to market conditions  opportunities and other factors 
as of december   the fair value of our consolidated investment portfolio was approximately million  comprised of i cash equivalents of approximately million  ii debt securities generally  u

see note investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item below 
government regulation and initiatives florida insurance companies  such as the insurance entities  are subject to regulation and supervision by the oir 
the oir has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
such powers relate  among other things  to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  the licensing of agents through the florida department of financial services  the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  the nature of  and limitations on  investments  approval of policy forms and rates  review of reinsurance contracts  periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies  and the form and content of required financial statements 
such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders and not for the benefit of investors 
florida created the citizens property insurance corporation citizens to provide insurance to florida homeowners in high risk areas and to others without private insurance options 
as of january   there were  citizens policies in force compared to  as of february  in may  florida passed legislation that froze property insurance rates for citizens customers at december levels through december   and permits insurance customers to opt into citizens when the price of a privately offered insurance policy is more than the citizens rate  compared to the previous opt in threshold of 
these initiatives  together with any future initiatives that seek to further relax eligibility requirements or reduce premium rates for citizens customers  could adversely affect our ability and the ability of insurance entities to conduct profitable business 
in addition  the florida legislature in expanded the capacity of the fhcf  with the intent of reducing the cost of reinsurance otherwise purchased by residential property insurers 
state and federal legislation relating to insurance is affected by a number of political and economic factors that are beyond our control 
the florida legislature and the national association of insurance commissioners naic from time to time consider proposals that may affect  among other things  regulatory assessments and reserve requirements 
in addition  the insurance entities are required to offer wind mitigation discounts in accordance with a program mandated by the florida legislature and implemented by the oir 
the level of wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature to be effective june  for new business and august  for renewal business have had a significant negative effect on upcic s premium 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the impact of wind mitigation discounts on our results of operations 
upcic has become and will become subject to other states laws and regulations as it has obtained and continues to seek authority to transact business in other states 
product pricing the rates charged by the insurance entities generally are subject to regulatory review and approval before they may be implemented 
the insurance entities periodically submit their rate revisions to regulators as required by law or deemed by us to be necessary or appropriate for the insurance entities business 
we prepare these filings 
table of contents for the insurance entities based on objective data relating to their business and on judgment exercised by management and by retained professionals 
the premiums charged by the insurance entities to policyholders are affected by legislative enactments and administrative rules  including a state mandated program requiring residential property insurance companies like ours to provide premium discounts when policyholders verify that insured properties have certain construction features or other windstorm loss reduction features 
the level of required premium discounts may exceed the expected reduction in losses associated with the construction features for which the discounts are provided 
although the insurance entities may submit rate filings to address any premium deficiencies  those rate filings are subject to regulatory oversight and may not be approved 
for information regarding recent rate filing approvals  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
competition the insurance industry is highly competitive and many companies currently write homeowners property and casualty insurance 
additionally  we must compete with companies that have greater capital resources and longer operating histories 
increased competition from other private insurance companies as well as citizens could adversely affect our ability to conduct profitable business 
in addition  our financial stability rating is an important factor in establishing our competitive position and may impact our sales 
although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors  we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price  choosing instead to compete on the basis of underwriting criteria  our distribution network and high quality service to our agents and insureds

item a 
risk factors we are subject to a variety of risks  the most significant of which are described below 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks 
risks relating to the property casualty business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of 
table of contents terrorism 
we may incur catastrophe losses in excess of those experienced in prior years  or estimated by a catastrophe model we use  the average expected level used in pricing  and our current reinsurance coverage limits 
in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operations 
in addition  impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth 
although we use  what we believe to be  widely recognized and commercially available models to estimate hurricane loss exposure  other models exist that might produce higher or lower loss estimates 
the loss estimates developed by the catastrophe model are dependent upon assumptions or scenarios incorporated into the model by a third party developer and by us or our representatives 
however if these assumptions or scenarios do not reflect the characteristics of future catastrophic events that affect florida or the resulting economic conditions  such may result in exposure for losses not covered by our reinsurance program 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we retain significant exposure to catastrophic events 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses and have a negative impact on our business 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
although we pursue various loss management initiatives in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
we may experience declines in claim frequency from time to time 
the short term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant long term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition recorded claim reserves in the property casualty business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents predicting claim expense relating to environmental liabilities is inherently uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the process of estimating environmental liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through reinsurance 
litigation is a complex  lengthy process that involves substantial uncertainty for insurers 
actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating environmental net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
ultimate net losses from environmental liabilities could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure  such as engaging in rigorous underwriting  carefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies  and ceding risk to reinsurers 
however  there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics and no assurance can be given that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels in excess of our probable maximum loss models  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
it is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address 
such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these risks may be heightened during difficult economic conditions such as those currently being experienced in florida and elsewhere 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business our reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for our cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to participate in loss sharing may decrease our profitability from time to time  political dispositions affect the insurance market  including efforts to effectively suppress rates at a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
despite efforts to remove politics from insurance regulation  facts and history demonstrate that public policymakers  when faced with untoward events and adverse public sentiment  can act in ways that impede a satisfactory correlation between rates and risk 
such acts may affect our ability to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to attain rate adequacy along with targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for our cost 

table of contents additionally  we are required to participate in guaranty funds for insolvent insurance companies 
the funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing our profitability model may not be fully realized we believe that our profitability model has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our profitability model 
furthermore  we cannot be assured that the profitability model will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the business generated 
our financial condition and operating results and the financial condition and operating results of our insurance entities may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
continued weakness in the florida real estate market could adversely affect our loss results as of december   approximately of our policies in force and total insured values were derived from customers located in florida 
during the past several years  florida has experienced a significant economic downturn and among the highest real estate value diminution in the country 
continued weakness in the florida real estate market could result in fewer home sales  which may adversely affect the number of policies we are able to sell and or the rates we are able to charge to customers 
additionally  higher incidents of foreclosed or vacant homes may result in increased claims activity under residential insurance policies  which could negatively impact our operating results 
risks relating to investments we have periodically experienced  and may experience further reductions in returns or losses on our investments especially during periods of heightened volatility  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our investment strategy  which includes maximizing returns  subjects our investment portfolio to significant volatility 
the returns on our investment portfolio may be reduced or we may incur losses as a result of changes in general economic conditions  interest rates  real estate markets  fixed income markets  metals markets  energy markets  agriculture markets  equity markets  alternative investment markets  credit markets  exchange rates  global capital market conditions and numerous other factors that are beyond our control 
the worldwide financial markets experience high levels of volatility during certain periods  which could have an increasingly adverse impact on the us and foreign economies 
the financial market volatility and the resulting negative economic impact could continue and it is possible that it may be prolonged  which could adversely affect our current investment portfolio  make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in our portfolio and or make it difficult for us to purchase suitable investments that meet our risk and return criteria 
these factors could cause us to realize less than expected returns on invested assets  sell investments for a loss or write off or write down investments  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents we are subject to market risk which may adversely impact investment income our primary market risk exposures are changes in equity and commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currencies 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a portion of our investment portfolio 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  collateral types  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
our overall financial performance is significantly dependent on the returns on our investment portfolio  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause such results to be volatile 
the performance of our investment portfolio is independent of the revenue and income generated from our insurance operations  and there is no direct correlation between the financial results of these two activities 
thus  to the extent that our investment portfolio does not perform well due to the factors discussed above or otherwise  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected even if our insurance operations perform favorably 
further  because the returns on our investment portfolio may be volatile  our overall results of operations may likewise be volatile from period to period even if we do not experience significant financial variances in our insurance operations 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consist with our business goals 
difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results the united states economy has experienced widespread job losses  higher unemployment  lower consumer spending  continued declines in home prices and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages 
moreover  recent disruptions in the financial markets  particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements  have affected the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates 
we cannot predict the length and severity of a recession  but as with most businesses  we believe a longer or more severe recession could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents a general economic slowdown could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on our investment portfolio 
consumer behavior could include decreased demand for insurance 
in and  weakness in the housing market and a highly competitive environment contributed to reduced growth in policies in force 
our investment portfolio could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system  the financial markets and the broader economy  the us government  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking action to address such conditions including  among other things  purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and financial institution holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions 
such continued volatility and economic deterioration could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as an insurance company  we are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by us 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded risks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the risk we insure  although it does make the reinsurer liable to us in the event of a claim 
as such  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions 
table of contents of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
additionally  in the event that terrorist acts occur  we could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
a downgrade in our financial stability rating may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition financial stability ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under an insurer s control 
the current insurance financial stability rating of upcic is from demotech  inc the assigned rating is a 
because this rating is subject to continuous review  the retention of this rating cannot be assured 
a downgrade in or withdrawal of this rating  or a decision by demotech to require upcic s parent company to make a capital infusion into upcic to maintain its rating  may adversely affect our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain financing on favorable terms 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows property and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes 
catastrophic losses have had a significant impact on our historical results 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  tsunamis  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  flooding  severe winter weather and fires and may include man made events  such as terrorist attacks 
the incidence  frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 

table of contents longer term weather trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  including effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperature  sea levels  rain and snow 
the emerging science regarding climate change and its connection to extreme weather events is far from conclusive 
if a connection to increased extreme weather events related to climate change is ultimately proven true  this could increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses we experience in both coastal and non coastal areas 
loss of key executives could affect our operations our operations depend in large part on the efforts of our chief executive officer  bradley i 
meier and on the efforts of our chief operating officer  sean p 
downes 
the loss of the services provided by either mr 
meier or mr 
downes could have a material adverse effect on the insurance entities and on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if mr 
meier were to become incapacitated or elect to reduce his responsibilities  we would expect that mr 
downes would assume his responsibilities

other significant sources of revenue include commissions collected from reinsurers and policy fees 
investment portfolio as discussed under item business investments  we seek to generate income through the investment activities conducted by each of the insurance entities and uih 
our investment strategy is intended to support our overall business strategy and supplement income derived from our insurance underwriting activities 
thus  our operating results are significantly dependent upon the results of our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of net losses on our trading portfolio  compared to million of net gains for the year ended december  the losses in our trading portfolio in reflect a particularly steep decline in the value of our equity securities holdings occurring mostly during the second half of the year 
excluding cash and cash equivalents  at december   million  or  
table of contents of our total trading portfolio was invested in equity securities as compared to million  or  at december  the composition of our trading portfolio will change due to market conditions  opportunities  and other factors 
our results of operations in will significantly be impacted by our ability to manage our investment portfolio as well as the conditions in the securities and financial markets  particularly as it relates to our investments in equity securities 
we expect that our investment portfolio will consist primarily of domestic  and to a lesser degree foreign  debt and equity securities and  to a much lesser degree  non hedging derivative securities and physically held precious metals 
however  we may  subject to florida regulations applicable to our insurance entities  invest a portion of our funds in other asset types 
recent developments on january   we declared a cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock payable on april   to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  on february   upcic received approval for a premium rate increase for its homeowner s program within the state of florida 
the premium rate increase averaged approximately percent statewide 
the effective dates for the rate increase were february  for new business and march  for renewal business 
during the second quarter of  upcic completed its reinsurance program effective june  see reinsurance program below for a description of that program 
on august   we declared a cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock  payable on october   to shareholders of record at the close of business on september  on august   we announced that the georgia department of insurance approved the homeowners rates and forms of its wholly owned subsidiary  upcic 
on october   upcic remitted million as a deposit with the florida department of financial services 
in consultation with the oir  upcic has offered to segregate from its general operating funds an amount equivalent to its anticipated future reinsurance premiums under the arrangement with t and upcic 
see reinsurance program for further discussion regarding this arrangement 
on november   we announced that appcic had written its first homeowners insurance policy in florida 
appcic received approval of its rate filing from the oir during the second quarter of appcic currently writes homeowners multi peril and inland marine insurance on florida homes valued in excess of million  which are limits and coverages currently not targeted through its affiliate  upcic 
on november   we announced that upcic had written its first homeowners insurance policies in georgia making it the fifth state in which upcic conducts business 
on december   we declared a cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock payable on december   to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  on january   we announced that upcic received approval from the oir for premium rate increases for its homeowners and dwelling fire programs within florida 
the premium rate increases will average approximately statewide for its homeowners program and for its dwelling fire dwelling fire program 
the effective dates for both of the premium rate increases are january  for new business and february  for renewal business 
a forms filing was made immediately after the rate filing to segregate the sinkhole coverage and to include updated policy language as a result of the property insurance bill which became law in may senate bill 
this forms filing is currently pending with the oir with an expected approval and implementation month 
table of contents of march with the approval of this forms filing  sinkhole coverage will be removed from certain base homeowners policies and the coverage will be offered via endorsement for an additional surcharge  and a mandatory deductible  to those policyholders that meet the proposed eligibility standards 
revised inspection and eligibility requirements will not be imposed upon existing policyholders who elect to continue sinkhole coverage at their policy renewal 
sinkhole coverage and form changes for dwelling fire were filed at the same time and are similar in nature to those filed for homeowners 
notification requirements for sinkhole coverage changes  once approved  will dictate the actual effective date for renewal business depending on the date of approval from the oir 
coverage for catastrophic ground cover collapse will remain a covered peril under all standard policy forms 
on february   we declared a dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock payable on april   to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  impact of new accounting pronouncement as discussed below in new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted  we intend to prospectively adopt new accounting guidance in the first quarter of related to accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
this guidance will result in a reduction of our net deferred policy acquisition costs by approximately to  which will cause us to recognize a material charge against earnings during the first quarter of this charge represents an acceleration of deferred charges in the period of adoption  which would have ultimately been recognized within a twelve month period 
thus  our adoption of this new accounting guidance will likely have a material impact on our results of operations in the first quarter of prior year rate increases impacting current results on october   upcic received approval for a premium rate increase for its homeowner s program within florida 
the premium rate increase averaged approximately percent statewide 
the effective dates for the premium rate increase were october  for new business and december  for renewal business 
on november   upcic received approval for a premium rate increase for its dwelling fire program within florida 
the premium rate increase averaged approximately percent statewide 
the effective dates for the premium rate increase were november  for new business and december  for renewal business 
reinsurance program in the normal course of business  we limit the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks  risks in concentrated areas of exposure and catastrophes  such as hurricanes or other similar loss occurrences  by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements 
see item management of exposure to catastrophic losses 
our intention is to limit our exposure and the insurance entities exposure thereby protecting stockholders equity and the insurance entities capital and surplus  even in the event of catastrophic occurrences  through reinsurance agreements 
without these reinsurance agreements  the insurance entities would be more substantially exposed to catastrophic losses with a greater likelihood that those losses could exceed their statutory capital and surplus 
any such catastrophic event  or multiple catastrophes  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance entities solvency and our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
quota share effective june  through may   upcic entered into a quota share reinsurance contract with everest re

under the reimbursement agreement  the fhcf would reimburse upcic  for each loss occurrence during the contract year  for of the ultimate loss paid by upcic in excess of its retention plus of the reimbursed losses to cover loss adjustment expenses  subject to an aggregate contract limit 
a covered event means any one storm declared to be a hurricane by the national hurricane center for losses incurred in florida  both while it is a hurricane and through subsequent downgrades 
for the contract year june  to may   upcic purchased the traditional fhcf coverage and did not purchase the temporary increase in coverage limit option offered to insurers by the fhcf 
upcic s estimate of its traditional fhcf coverage is based upon upcic s exposure in force as of june   as reported by upcic to the fhcf on september  and is of billion in excess of million 
the estimated premium for this coverage is million 
also at june   the fhcf made available  and upcic obtained  million of additional catastrophe excess of loss coverage with one free reinstatement of coverage to carriers qualified as limited apportionment companies or companies that participated in the insurance capital build up incentive icbui program offered by the fhcf  such as upcic 
this particular layer of coverage at june  is million in excess of million 
the premium for this coverage is million 
on october   the sba published its most recent estimate of the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity in the florida administrative weekly 
the sba estimated that the fhcf s total loss reimbursement capacity under current market conditions for the contract year is projected to be billion over the month period following the estimate 
the sba also referred to its report entitled  october  estimated claims paying capacity report report as providing greater detail regarding the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity 
the report estimated that the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity range is billion to billion 
upcic elected to purchase the fhcf mandatory layer of coverage for the contract year  which corresponds to fhcf loss reimbursement capacity of billion 
by law  the fhcf s obligation to reimburse insurers is limited to its actual claims paying capacity 
the aggregate cost of upcic s reinsurance program may increase should upcic deem it necessary to purchase additional private market reinsurance due to reduced estimates of the fhcf s loss reimbursement capacity 
upcic purchased the fhcf mandatory layer of coverage for the contract year  which corresponds to fhcf loss reimbursement capacity of billion 
fortunately  no hurricanes made landfall in florida during the contract year and no reimbursement payments for the contract year were required from the fhcf to participating companies 
accordingly  the effect of the change in the fhcf s estimate had no effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
the fhcf is actively advocating a legislative change that would require the amount of reimbursement capacity made available to the insurance industry each year 
if adopted  this proposal 
table of contents would increase the cost of upcic s private market reinsurance program 
it is unclear whether the florida legislature will adopt the position advanced by the fhcf

upcic is responsible for losses related to catastrophic events with incurred losses in excess of coverage provided by upcic s reinsurance program and for losses that otherwise are not covered by the reinsurance program 
upcic estimates  based upon its in force exposures as of december   it had coverage to approximately the year probable maximum loss pml  modeled using air clasic v  long term  without demand surge 
recently  air updated its catastrophe model and outlook of risk with the release of its new version  air clasic v 
upcic estimates  based on its in force exposures as of december   that it had coverage to approximately the year pml  modeled using air clasic v  long term  without demand surge 
additionally  from time to time  upcic uses estimates from other catastrophe modeling vendors to estimate its pml 
upcic estimates based upon its in force exposures as of september   that it had coverage to approximately the year pml  modeled using rms s new release of its risklink model  v  long term  without loss amplification 
pml is a general concept applied in the insurance industry for defining high loss scenarios that should be considered when underwriting insurance risk 
both loss amplification and demand surge refer to the potential impact of secondary contributors to insured losses arising from catastrophic events 
examples of loss amplification or demand surge include increases in the cost of labor or materials  incremental losses associated with time elapsing between the initial date of loss and the date of repair  claim inflation  and potential coverage ambiguities due to concurrent causes of loss 
catastrophe models produce loss estimates that are quantified in terms of dollars and probabilities 
probability of exceedance or the probability that the actual loss level will exceed a particular threshold is a standard catastrophe model output 
for example  the year pml represents a annual probability of exceedance the year  year and year pml represents a  and annual probability of exceedance  respectively  for air v  air v and rms v 
it is estimated that the year pml is likely to be equaled or exceeded in one year out of on average  or percent of the time 
it is the th percentile of the annual loss distribution 
with the implementation of our reinsurance program at june   we retained a maximum  pre tax net liability of million as of december  for the first catastrophic event up to billion of losses 
refer to the preceding table for information with respect to subsequent catastrophic events coverage 
if catastrophic losses result in a net operating loss for the tax year  we can carry back the net operating loss to the and tax years and recover all  or a portion of  income taxes paid in those years 
separately from the insurance entities reinsurance programs  uih protected its own interests against diminution in value due to catastrophe events by purchasing million in coverage via a catastrophe risk linked transaction contract  effective june  through december  the contract provided for a recovery by uih in the event of the exhaustion of upcic s catastrophe coverage 
the total cost to uih of the risk linked transaction contract is million

t  established in accordance with bermuda law 
as part of our overall reinsurance program  t at times enters into underlying excess catastrophe contracts with the insurance entities for the purpose of assuming certain risk for specified loss occurrences  including hurricanes 
the agreements between t and the insurance entities are a cost effective alternative to reinsurance that the insurance entities would otherwise purchase from third party reinsurers 
while we retain the risk that otherwise would be transferred to third party reinsurers  these agreements provide benefits to the insurance entities in no loss years that cannot be replicated in the open reinsurance market 
these benefits include the return to the insurance entities of a substantial portion of the earned reinsurance premiums under the contract 
all the related intercompany transactions with respect to these agreements are eliminated in consolidation 
under the t agreement effective june  through may   t retained a maximum  pre tax liability of million  in excess of million  for the first catastrophic event up to billion of losses 
the insurance entities were required to make premium installment payments aggregating million to t  subject to the terms of the agreement 
through capital contributions made to t by uih  t contributes an amount equal to its liability for losses  net of the insurance entities required premium payments and expenses thereon  to a trust account as collateral 
the trust account was funded with the amount of required collateral at the inception of the agreement and invested in a cash reserve fund 
the amounts held in the cash reserve fund are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets 
the collateral held in trust was available to be used to pay any claims that may have arisen from the occurrence of covered events 
the collateral was required to be held in trust for the benefit of the insurance entities until the occurrence of a covered event or expiration or termination of the agreement between t and the insurance entities 
uih has no requirement to fund t in the event losses exceed the amount of collateral held in trust 
reinsurance agreements between t and the insurance entities are generally terminated on or about may and december each year and replaced with similarly structured agreements or with agreements with third party reinsurers effective june and january  respectively 
the terminations effective may are intended to coordinate and integrate the replacement contracts into the insurance entities overall reinsurance program and the related changes to limits and retention levels for the subsequent contract year ie  june through may 
the terminations effective december are intended to provide the aforementioned benefit of return premium to the insurance entities 
the t agreement effective june  through may  was terminated effective december   pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
in anticipation of the termination of the agreement  the affiliates agreed to release funds held in trust due to the beneficiary ie  the insurance entities during december and the balance to the grantor ie  uih in december and january we continually evaluate strategies to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophe losses  including the maintenance of catastrophic reinsurance coverage 
effective january   the t contract was subsequently replaced  at identical limits and retentions as the prior agreement  with an unaffiliated third party reinsurer as an open market purchase 
effective january  through may   under an excess catastrophe contract  the insurance entities obtained catastrophe coverage of million  in excess of million  covering certain loss occurrences including hurricanes 
the total cost of this reinsurance coverage is million 
in the event of a non hurricane loss subject to this contract  the insurance entities will pay to the reinsurer of the ultimate net loss ceded to the reinsurer arising out of such non hurricane loss

wind mitigation discounts the insurance premiums charged by the insurance entities are subject to various statutory and regulatory requirements 
among these  the insurance entities must offer wind mitigation discounts in accordance with a program mandated by the florida legislature and implemented by the oir 
the level of wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature to be effective june  for new business and august  for renewal business have had a significant negative effect on upcic s premium 

table of contents the following table reflects the effect of wind mitigation credits received by upcic policyholders in thousands date reduction of in force premium only policies including wind coverage percentage of upcic policyholders receiving credits total credits in force premium percentage reduction of in force premium insurers like upcic fully experience the impact of rate or discount changes more than months after they are implemented because their policies renew throughout the year 
although insurers may seek to rectify any problems through subsequent rate increase filings with the oir  there is no assurance that the oir and the insurers will agree on the amount of rate change that is needed 
in addition  any adjustments to the insurers rates similarly take more than months to be fully integrated into the insurers business 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our primary areas of estimate are described below 
recognition of premium revenues 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
management believes that its revenue recognition policies conform to staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
insurance liabilities 
reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying losses and lae under insurance policies the insurance entities have issued 
underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of losses and lae reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves 
reserves are established based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
upcic s claim settlement data suggests that homeowners 
table of contents property losses have an average settlement time of less than one year  while homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update reserve estimates quarterly as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve re estimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as losses and lae in the consolidated statements of income in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of losses and lae is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates 
reserves for losses and lae are determined in three separate steps 
these steps are the estimation of reserves for non catastrophe loss and defense and cost containment dcc expenses hereafter referred to simply as losses  estimation of reserves for hurricane experience  and estimation of reserves for adjusting and other ao expenses 
these three steps are further separated into the analysis of data groupings of like exposure 
these groups are property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  property damage on homeowner policy forms ho and ho combined  dwelling fire property damage  all homeowner liability exposure  other liability the optional liability coverage offered to dwelling fire policyholders  and all hurricane experience combined 
reserve estimates for non catastrophe losses are derived using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
that actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
this technique forms the basis of the six actuarial methods described below 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred  regardless of the date it was reported to the insurance entities 
this analysis is used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key data elements used to determine our reserve estimates include claim counts  paid losses  paid dcc  case reserves  and the related development factors applicable to this data 
the first method for estimating unpaid amounts for non hurricane losses is the reported development method 
this method is based upon the assumption that the relative change in a given year s reported loss estimates from one evaluation point to the next is similar to the relative change in prior years reported loss estimates at similar evaluation points 
in utilizing this method  actual annual historical reported loss data is evaluated 
successive years can be arranged to form a triangle of data 
report to report rtr development factors are calculated to measure the change in cumulative reported losses from one evaluation point to the next 
these historical rtr factors form the basis for selecting the rtr factors used in projecting the current valuation of losses to an ultimate basis 
in addition  a tail factor is selected to account for loss development beyond the observed experience 
the tail factor is based on trends shown in the data and consideration of industry loss development benchmarks 
this method s implicit assumption is that the relative adequacy of case reserves has been consistent over time  and that there have been no material changes in the rate at which claims have been reported 
the second method is the paid development method 
this method is similar to the reported development method  however  case reserves are excluded from the analysis 
while this method has the disadvantage of not recognizing the information provided by current case reserves  it has the advantage of avoiding potential distortions in the data due to changes in case reserving methodology 
this method s implicit assumption is that the rate of payment of claims has been relatively consistent over time 
the third method is the reported bornhuetter ferguson b f method 
this method is essentially a blend of two other methods 
the first method is the loss development method described above  whereby actual reported losses are multiplied by an expected loss development factor 
for slow reporting coverages  the loss development 
table of contents method can lead to erratic and unreliable projections  because a relatively small swing in early reporting periods can result in a large swing in ultimate projections 
the second method is the expected loss method a description of the expected loss method follows the description of the reported b f method  whereby the ibnr estimate equals the difference between predetermined estimates of expected losses and actual reported losses 
this has the advantage of stability  but it does not respond to actual results as they emerge 
the reported b f method combines these two methods by setting ultimate losses equal to actual reported losses plus expected unreported losses 
as an experience year matures and expected unreported losses become smaller  the initial expected loss assumption becomes gradually less important 
two parameters are needed to apply the b f method the initial expected loss ratio and the expected reporting pattern 
the initial expected loss ratio for each accident year other than the current year is set equal to the estimated ultimate loss ratio from the prior analysis 
the initial expected loss ratio for the current year is determined based on trends in historical ratios  rate changes  and underlying loss trends 
the expected reporting pattern is based on the reported loss development method described above 
this method is often used for long tail lines and in situations where the reported loss experience is relatively immature or lacks sufficient credibility for the application of other methods 
as mentioned above  one component of the b f method is the expected loss method 
in this method  ultimate loss projections are based upon some prior measure of the anticipated losses  usually relative to some measure of exposure  such as premiums  revenues  or payroll 
an expected loss ratio or loss cost pure premium is applied to the measure of exposure to determine estimated ultimate losses for each year 
actual losses are not considered in this calculation 
this method has the advantage of stability over time because the ultimate loss estimates do not change unless the exposures or pure premiums change 
however  this advantage of stability is offset by a lack of responsiveness  since this method does not consider actual loss experience as it emerges 
this method is based on the assumption that the pure premium per unit of exposure is a good indication of ultimate losses 
it is entirely dependent on pricing assumptions 
the fourth method is the paid b f method 
this method is analogous to the reported b f method using paid losses and development patterns in place of reported losses and patterns 
the fifth method is the reported counts and averages method 
in this method  an estimate of unpaid losses is determined by separately projecting ultimate reported claim counts and ultimate reported claim severities cost per reported claim for each accident period 
typically  loss development methods are used to project ultimate claim counts and claim severities based on historical data using the same methodology described in the reported development method above 
estimated ultimate losses are then calculated as the product of the two items 
this method is intended to avoid data distortions that may exist with the other methods for the most recent years as a result of changes in case reserve levels  settlement rates  etc 
in addition  it may provide insight into the drivers of loss experience 
the sixth method is the paid counts and averages method 
this method is analogous to the reported counts and averages method using paid claims counts and paid claim severities and their related development patterns in place of reported data 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
the implicit assumption of these techniques is that the selected rtr factors combine to form loss development patterns that are predictive of future loss development 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that the selected development factors includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  an unusually large amount of catastrophe 
table of contents losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
the six methods described above all produce an estimate of ultimate losses 
based on the results of these six methods  a single estimate commonly referred to as an actuarial point central estimate of the ultimate loss is selected 
estimated ibnr reserves are determined by subtracting the reported loss from the selected ultimate loss 
the estimated ibnr reserves are added to case reserves to determine the total estimated unpaid losses 
estimates of unpaid losses for hurricane experience are not developed using company specific development patterns  due to the relatively infrequent nature of storms and the high severity typically associated with them 
both the reported development method and the paid development method were used to estimate ultimate losses 
however  the development patterns were based on industry data determined by our consulting actuary 
there is an inherent assumption that relying on industry development patterns as opposed to company specific patterns produces more credible results for projecting hurricane losses 
estimated unpaid amounts for non catastrophe ao expenses are determined as the product of the estimated number of outstanding claims whether open or unreported times an estimate of average ao per claim 
universal s claims are handled by uac  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the procedure we followed was to begin by developing a history of average ao expenses per closed claim whether with or without payment for each line of business 
since average fees have increased dramatically in the last two years  we placed reliance primarily on the indications from those two years in making our selections 
the selected average ao expense was then multiplied by the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future whether with or without payment to determine an estimated liability 
the estimated number of claims to be closed in the future was determined by projecting reported claims for each accident year to an estimated ultimate basis using the traditional development factor method  then subtracting the total number of claims that have closed as of december  whether with or without payment 
in the case of the ao liabilities associated with hurricane exposure  a similar procedure was used to determine an estimate of the average ao expense per closed claim as was used for the non catastrophe ao liabilities 
however  a different procedure was used to estimate the number of claims to be closed in the future since the reported claim count development method would not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate hurricane claims 
three separate estimates of outstanding claims were determined 
in one method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was estimated as the ratio of paid losses to closed claims 
in the second method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where estimated claim severity was determined as the ratio of reported losses to reported claims 
in the third method  estimated outstanding claims were determined as the ratio of estimated unpaid losses to estimated claim severity  where claim severity was determined as the ratio of case reserves to open claims 
based on these three methods a final selection was made on estimated outstanding claim counts 
the final selection is multiplied by estimated average ao expense per claim to derive the estimated liability 
how reserve estimates are established and updated 
reserve estimates are developed for both open claims and ibnr claims 
the actuarial methods described above are used to derive claim settlement patterns by determining development factors to be applied to specific data elements 
development factors are calculated for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled  paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 

table of contents these estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated balance sheets 
reserves are re estimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results 
this process incorporates the historic and latest trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
when actual development of claims reported  paid losses or case reserve changes are different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve re estimate and an increase or decrease in losses and lae will be recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
total reserve re estimates  as a percent of losses and lae expenses before reserve re estimates  in  and were  and  respectively 
reserve re estimates were primarily the result of actual loss development on prior year non catastrophe losses 
reserve re estimates on non catastrophe losses are a result of settling homeowner s losses established in the prior year for amounts that were more than expected 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on indications of updated development factor calculations 
reserve re estimates for catastrophe losses  which are associated with the high level of uncertainty related to hurricane claims are described under catastrophe losses below 
factors affecting reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to property  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and an initial case reserve of  is set for these claims 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are re estimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually 
table of contents achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae relate to the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
key assumptions that are premised on future emergence that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns include but are not limited to adverse changes in loss cost trends  including inflationary pressures in home repair costs  judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability  and plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  in purported class action litigation related to claims handling and other practices 
by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty 
since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year and claims that have occurred but have not been reported pure ibnr claims 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses are related to homes that were damaged 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest re estimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving litigation 
reserves for catastrophe losses 
loss and lae reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property casualty insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
a catastrophe is an event that produces significant pre tax losses before reinsurance and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  tornadoes  wildfires  tropical storms and hurricanes 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or 
table of contents wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
key actuarial assumptions that affect the loss and lae estimate 
the aggregation of estimates for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  actuarial techniques are applied to the data elements for paid losses and reported losses separately for homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses and catastrophe losses to estimate the potential variability of our reserves  within a reasonable probability of outcomes 
at any given point in time  our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration cost of our insured claims incurred and unpaid 
since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables  such as fluctuations in inflation  judicial decisions  legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than these estimates 
we revise reserves for losses and lae as additional information becomes available  and reflect adjustments  if any  in earnings in the periods in which they are determined 
on an annual basis  our independent actuary provides a statement of actuarial opinion sao that certifies the carried reserves make a reasonable provision for all of the insurance entities unpaid loss and lae obligations under the terms of our contracts and agreements with our policyholders 
we review the sao and compare the projected ultimate losses and lae per the sao to our own projection of ultimate losses and lae to ensure that loss and lae reserves recorded at each annual balance sheet date are based upon our analysis of all internal and external factors related to known and unknown claims against us 
we compare our recorded reserves to the indicated range provided in the report accompanying the sao 
at december   the recorded amount for net loss and lae falls within the range determined by our independent actuaries and approximates their best estimate 
in selecting the rtr development factors described above in the section titled the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates  due consideration is given to how the rtr development factors change from one year to the next over the course of several consecutive years of recent history 
in addition to the loss development triangles cited above  various diagnostic triangles  such as triangles showing historical patterns in the ratio of paid to reported losses and paid to reported claim counts  are typically prepared as a means of determining the stability of various determinants of loss development  such as consistency in claims settlement and case reserving 
with respect to upcic s primary exposure  florida personal property coverage  the hurricanes in and required upcic to place more focus on adjusting hurricane claims during  and into upcic then experienced a surge in non hurricane claims which led the loss development patterns for non catastrophe losses to increase substantially in the years during and following the active hurricane seasons of and potential reserve estimate variability 
given the nature of our business catastrophe exposed personal property coverage  the methods employed by actuaries include a range of estimated unpaid losses reflecting a level of uncertainty 
the range of estimated ultimate losses is typically smaller for older  more mature accident periods and greater for more recent  less mature accident periods 
the greatest level of uncertainty is associated with accident years during which catastrophe events occurred 
for example  the increased uncertainty associated with accident years and increases the bounds of the range 

table of contents in selecting the range of reasonable estimates  the assumptions used to select development factors and initial expected loss ratios are not changed 
rather  the range of indications produced by the various methods is inspected  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method are considered  and from those inputs a range of estimates can be selected 
projections of loss and lae liabilities are subject to potentially large errors of estimation since the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred 
examples of these events include jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes  public attitudes  and social economic conditions such as inflation 
any estimate of future costs is subject to the inherent limitation on one s ability to predict the aggregate course of future events 
it should therefore be expected that the actual emergence of losses and lae will vary  perhaps materially  from any estimate 
the inherent uncertainty associated with the insurance entities loss and lae liability is magnified due to upcic s concentration of property business in catastrophe exposed coastal states  primarily florida 
the and hurricanes created great uncertainty in determining ultimate losses for these natural catastrophes 
issues related to applicability of deductibles  availability and cost of repair services and materials  and other factors have increased the variability in estimates of the related loss reserves 
upcic has experienced unanticipated unfavorable loss development on catastrophe losses from claims related to and being reopened and new claims being opened due to public adjusters encouraging policyholders to file new claims  and from assessments related to condominium policies 
due to the inherent uncertainty  the parameters of the loss estimation methodologies are updated on an annual basis as new information emerges 
adequacy of reserve estimates 
we believe our net loss and lae reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for reported losses and ibnr losses and as a result we believe no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
we have created a proprietary claims analysis tool pp to analyze and calculate reserves 
pp is a custom built application that aggregates  analyzes and forecasts reserves based on historical data that spans more than a decade 
it identifies historical claims data using same like kind and quality variables that exist in present claims and sets forth appropriate  more accurate reserves on current claims 
pp is reviewed by management on a weekly basis in reviewing the topography of existing and incoming claims 
pp will be analyzed at each quarters end and adjustments to reserves are made at an aggregate level when appropriate 
pp was initially used for third quarter reserve analysis resulting in an increase in and loss year reserves 
further refinements were put into place in fourth quarter which included inflation adjustments for past claims into dollars inflation guard 
pp was reviewed by an independent third party for data integrity and system reliability 
this program is used for quarterly reviews on an ongoing basis 
due to the uncertainties involved  the scenarios described and quantified above are reasonably likely  but the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae at december  is million 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred ceding commissions 
commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they are related 
determination of costs other than commissions that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business requires estimates to allocate certain operating expenses 
as of december   deferred policy acquisition costs were million and deferred ceding commissions were million 
deferred policy acquisition costs were reduced by deferred ceding commissions and shown net on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million 
provision for premium deficiency 
our policy is to evaluate and recognize losses on insurance contracts when estimated future claims and maintenance costs under a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future 
table of contents premiums and investment income 
the determination of the provision for premium deficiency requires estimation of the costs of losses  catastrophic reinsurance and policy maintenance to be incurred and investment income to be earned over the remaining policy period 
management has determined that a provision for premium deficiency was not warranted as of december  reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  we seek to reduce the risk of loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
while ceding premiums to reinsurers reduces our risk of exposure in the event of catastrophic losses  it also reduces our potential for greater profits in the event that such catastrophic events do not occur 
we believe that the extent of our reinsurance is typical of a company of our size in the homeowners insurance industry 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the reinsurance agreement and consistent with the establishment of our liability 
the insurance entities reinsurance policies do not relieve them from their obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses  consequently  allowances are established for amounts deemed uncollectible 
no such allowance was deemed necessary as of december  new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance related to accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
this guidance defines allowable deferred acquisition costs as costs incurred by insurance entities for the successful acquisition of new and renewal contracts 
such costs result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction s and would not have been incurred by the insurance entity had the contract s not occurred 
this guidance will be effective for periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we plan to prospectively adopt this guidance on january  although we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact to our financial statements  this guidance represents a significant departure from current industry practice upon adoption and will result in a reduction in our net deferred policy acquisition costs of approximately to  with a corresponding charge to earnings  and a reduction of deferrals and amortization of policy acquisition costs in future periods 
this adjustment represents an acceleration of the amortization of costs in the period of adoption  which would ultimately have been charged to earnings within a twelve month period 
in june  the fasb updated its guidance related to the comprehensive income topic of the fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the objective of this updated guidance is to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option of presenting components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the guidance requires total comprehensive income including both the net income components and other comprehensive income components be reported in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or two separate but consecutive statements the approach currently used in our consolidated financial statements 
this guidance is to be applied retrospectively to fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
since we already use the two statement approach for reporting comprehensive income  this guidance will not have an impact on the presentation of our financial statements and notes 
in may  the fasb updated its guidance related to the fair value measurement  topic of the asc  to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements with international financial reporting standards 
the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in united states generally accepted accounting principles  to clarify the intent of application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  and to change particular principles or requirements for measuring and disclosing fair value measurements 
the amendments are to be applied prospectively to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the amendments are to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of the guidance and its impact on our financial statements

the benefit from these factors was partially offset by an increase in the number of policies in force eligible for wind mitigation credits 
net unrealized losses on investments of million  recorded during year ended december   reflect the net decrease in value of investments held in our trading portfolio as of december  as well as the reversal of unrealized gains or losses for securities held at december  and subsequently sold 
these unrealized losses in the trading portfolio for the year ended december   were partially offset by realized gains of million and foreign currency gains on investments of million recorded during the same period 
the unrealized losses reflect a decline in the value of our equity securities holdings during the second half of the year ended december  we will continue to record future changes in the market value of our trading portfolio directly to earnings as unrealized gains and losses on investments

in previous periods  the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio were appropriately included in other comprehensive income rather than current period income 
commission revenue is comprised principally of reinsurance commission sharing agreements 
the increase in commission revenue of million is due to an increase in the amount of ceded premiums 
the increase in other revenues of thousand is primarily due to a higher volume of referrals made to other insurance companies for coverage that we do not offer 
the increase in losses and lae expenses is due to the servicing of additional policies from the growth in the average number of policies in force and the associated increase in the aggregate total insured value of those policies on a year over year basis

amounts charged or credited to our earnings represent timing differences between the time assessments are made by figa to us  and the collection of those assessments from policyholders 
there were also increases in insurance department fees and legal fees related to corporate matters 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in performance based incentive bonus accruals which are based on measures of income before income taxes 
there were also decreases in stock based compensation  bad debt expense and equipment expense 
the decrease in income tax expense was the result of a significant reduction in taxable income due to losses in the trading portfolio and additional reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our effective tax rate remained relatively the same at for the year ended december  compared to for the same period during we have not recorded other comprehensive income since we transferred the available for sale portfolio to trading

the maximum dividend that may be paid by the insurance entities to uih without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end 
during the years ended december  and  the insurance entities did not pay dividends to uih 

table of contents our insurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies sold by the insurance entities 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums  commissions  policy fees and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay loss claims and operating expenses 
we maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  marketable securities 
liquidity can also be generated by funds received upon the sale of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
effective july   we elected to classify our securities investment portfolio as trading 
accordingly  purchases and sales of investment securities are included in cash flows from operations beginning july  we generated million from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million used and million generated for the years ended december  and cash flows generated from operating activities during the year ended december   includes proceeds from sales of investment securities  net of purchases of million 
the use of cash in operating activities during the year ended december reflects purchases of investment securities  net of proceeds from sales  of million since july  when we transferred our securities from the available for sale classification to trading 
prior to july   proceeds from the sale  and purchases of securities were reflected in investing activities 
the insurance entities are responsible for losses related to catastrophic events with incurred losses in excess of coverage provided by our reinsurance programs and for losses that otherwise are not covered by the reinsurance programs  which could have a material adverse effect on the insurance entities and the our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

the insurance entities are required annually to comply with the naic risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc requirements prescribe a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
naic s rbc requirements are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers who show signs of weak or deteriorating condition 
as of december   based on calculations using the appropriate naic rbc formula  the insurance entities reported total adjusted capital was in excess of the requirements 
failure by the insurance entities to maintain the required level of statutory capital and surplus could result in the suspension of their authority to write new or renewal business  other regulatory actions  or ultimately  in the revocation of their certificate of authority by the oir 
on november   upcic entered into a million surplus note with the florida state board of administration sba under florida s insurance capital build up incentive program icbui 
the surplus note has a twenty year term and accrues interest  adjusted quarterly based on the year constant maturity treasury index 
for the first three years of the term of the surplus note  upcic was required to pay interest only 
in may  the florida legislature passed a law providing participants in the icbui an opportunity to amend the terms of their surplus notes based on law changes 
the new law contains methods for calculating compliance with the writing ratio requirements that are more favorable to upcic than prior law and the prior terms of the surplus note 
on november   upcic and the sba executed an addendum to the surplus note addendum that reflects these law changes 
the terms of the addendum were effective july  in addition to other less significant changes  the addendum modifies the definitions of minimum required surplus  minimum writing ratio  surplus  and gross written premium  as defined in the original surplus note 

table of contents prior to the execution of the addendum  upcic was in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
upcic currently remains in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
an event of default will occur under the surplus note  as amended  if upcic i defaults in the payment of the surplus note  ii drops below a net written premium to surplus of for three consecutive quarters beginning january  and drops below a gross written premium to surplus ratio of for three consecutive quarters beginning january   iii fails to submit quarterly filings to the oir  iv fails to maintain at least million of surplus during the term of the surplus note  except for certain situations  v misuses proceeds of the surplus note  vi makes any misrepresentations in the application for the program  vii pays any dividend when principal or interest payments are past due under the surplus note  or viii fails to maintain a level of surplus sufficient to cover in excess of upcic s in year probable maximum loss as determined by a hurricane loss model accepted by the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology as certified by the oir annually 
as of december   upcic s net written premium to surplus ratio and gross written premium to surplus ratio were in excess of the required minimums and  therefore  upcic is not subject to increases in interest rates 
liability for losses we are required to periodically estimate and reflect on our balance sheet the amount needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment expenses 
see item liability for losses 
as a result of our analysis of loss reserves and trends  the provision for losses and lae  net of related reinsurance recoverables  increased by million and million in and  respectively 
these increases were recorded in response to reserve development in prior accident years 
some of the increase in reserves is attributable to development on the small number of hurricane claims that remain open 
adjustments relating to older accident years also reflect increases in certain types of activities in upcic s non catastrophe claims that are more typically associated with catastrophe claims 
examples include insureds re opening claims  seeking payments without corresponding repairs  and using public adjusters 
these activities were prevalent in the catastrophe claims arising from and hurricane seasons but subsequently increased in non catastrophe claims as the number of remaining hurricane claims subsided 
in addition  certain changes to florida law in recent years have adversely affected claims payout patterns 
florida laws relating to sinkhole claims also have generated claims in older accident years as insureds seek to establish that sinkhole activity occurred in policy periods pre dating legislative changes 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending liability for unpaid losses and lae as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  balance at beginning of year less reinsurance recoverable net balance at beginning of year incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance at end of year plus reinsurance recoverable balance at end of year 
table of contents based upon consultations with our independent actuarial consultants and their statement of opinion on losses and lae  we believe that the liability for unpaid losses and lae is currently adequate to cover all claims and related expenses which may arise from incidents reported and ibnr 
see our discussion in critical accounting policies and estimates adequacy of reserve estimates for information about a tool used by management to analyze and calculate reserves 
the following table provides total unpaid loss and lae  net of related reinsurance recoverables in thousands years ended december  unpaid loss and lae  net ibnr loss and lae  net total unpaid loss and lae  net reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and lae reinsurance recoverable on ibnr loss and lae total reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and lae the table below illustrates the change over time of the direct reserves established for unpaid losses and lae for the insurance entities liability for unpaid losses and lae re estimates at the end of the last eleven calendar years through december  in thousands the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of our expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 

table of contents the table also presents the gross re estimated liability as of the end of the latest re estimation period  with separate disclosure of the related re estimated reinsurance recoverable 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae re estimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 
unfavorable reserve re estimates are shown in this table in parentheses

table of contents the cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
a deficiency indicates that the latest estimate of the liability for losses and lae is higher than the liability that was originally estimated and a redundancy indicates that such estimate is lower 
it should be emphasized that the table presents a run off of balance sheet liability for the periods indicated rather than accident or policy loss development for those periods 
therefore  each amount in the table includes the cumulative effects of changes in liability for all prior periods 
conditions and trends that have affected liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
underwriting results of insurance companies are frequently measured by their combined ratios  which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios described in the following paragraph 
however  investment income  federal income taxes and other non underwriting income or expense are not reflected in the combined ratio 
the profitability of property and casualty insurance companies depends on income from underwriting  investment and service operations 
underwriting results are considered profitable when the combined ratio is under and unprofitable when the combined ratio is over 
the following table provides the statutory loss ratios  expense ratios and combined ratios for the periods indicated for the insurance entities years ended december  loss ratio upcic appcic na expense ratio upcic appcic na combined ratio upcic appcic na the ratios are net of reinsurance  including catastrophe reinsurance premiums which comprise a significant cost  and inclusive of lae 
the expense ratios include management fees and commission paid to an affiliate of the insurance entities in the amount of million and million for upcic for the years ended december  and  respectively and thousand for the year ended december  for appcic 
the fees and commission paid to the affiliate are eliminated in consolidation 
appcic began offering policies in late and had no paid claims as of december  the loss ratio represents an estimate 
na not applicable 
in order to reduce losses and thereby reduce the loss ratio and the combined ratio  we have taken several steps 
these steps include closely monitoring rate levels for new and renewal business  restructuring the homeowners insurance coverage offered  reducing the cost of catastrophic reinsurance coverage  and working to reduce general and administrative expenses 
ratings upcic s financial strength is rated by a rating agency to measure upcic s ability to meet its financial obligations to its policyholders 
the agency maintains a letter scale financial stability rating system ranging from a a double prime to l licensed by state regulatory authorities 
in march  to help address questions and concerns regarding the agency s rating and review process  the agency published guidance on financial stability ratings and catastrophe reinsurance program reporting for florida property insurers 
the document contains the criteria the agency considers when reviewing a company 

table of contents on march   upcic received notice from the agency that it would require a capital infusion of million by april  in order for it to maintain its a rating 
to comply with this requirement uih contributed an aggregate amount of million to upcic in march on november   the agency affirmed upcic s financial stability rating of a 
a financial stability rating of a is the third highest of six possible rating levels 
according to the agency  a ratings are assigned to insurers that have exceptional ability to maintain liquidity of invested assets  quality reinsurance  acceptable financial leverage and realistic pricing while simultaneously establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at reasonable levels 
the rating of upcic is subject to at least annual review by  and may be revised upward or downward or revoked at the sole discretion of the agency 
ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
in addition  the rating agency may at any time require a capital infusion into upcic by its parent company in order to maintain its rating  which may adversely affect our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
see item a a downgrade in our financial stability rating may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable in thousands total less than year years years over years unpaid losses and lae  direct long term debt operating leases employment agreements total contractual obligations these amounts represent minimum salaries  which may be subject to annual percentage increases  non equity incentive compensation based on pre tax or net income levels  and fringe benefits based on the remaining term of employment agreements we have with our executives 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the cost of paying losses and lae 
insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of loss and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses 
consequently  we attempt to anticipate the future impact of inflation when establishing rate levels 
while we attempt to charge adequate rates  we may be limited in raising its premium levels for competitive and regulatory reasons 
inflation also affects the market value of our investment portfolio and the investment rate of return 
any future economic changes which result in prolonged and increasing levels of inflation could cause increases in the dollar amount of incurred loss and lae and thereby materially adversely affect future liability requirements
