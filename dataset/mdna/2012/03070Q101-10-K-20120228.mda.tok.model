competition st 
charles ameristar st 
charles competes with five other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in illinois 
illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
they are also subject to gaming position limitations and a statewide indoor smoking ban 
illinois casinos are allowed to extend gaming credit to their patrons  while missouri regulations do not allow gaming credit to be given 
the st 
louis market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competitors within miles 
in december  the missouri gaming commission allowed an operator to commence construction of a new casino property in cape girardeau  missouri  approximately miles southeast of the st 
louis market 
construction of that property began in and is projected to open in december  as the state s thirteenth casino 
assuming the successful completion and licensing of the cape girardeau property  no additional gaming licenses will be awarded in the state of missouri  as the number of permitted casinos was capped at by referendum in we currently do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
however  increased competition for our st 
charles property would result if illinois law is changed in the future to allow the operation of slot machines at the existing pari mutuel racetrack near east st 
louis 
this has been proposed from time to time by members of the illinois legislature 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with five other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
the newest competitor began operations in february at the kansas speedway in wyandotte county  kansas  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
ameristar kansas city s location is the farthest east from the new casino  which may mitigate the impact on our casino 
the shuttered pari mutuel racetrack in wyandotte county  kansas has been authorized by the kansas legislature to offer slot machines 
however  the owner of the facility has opted not to reopen the facility and offer the machines due to the high tax rate imposed on these machines 
if the race track were to reopen  we would face additional competition at ameristar kansas city 
council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued in the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other licenses are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a land based casino with a pari mutuel racetrack 
the council bluffs market is insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competitor located approximately miles away 
in  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to allow a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa to be utilized for gaming purposes 
the parcel is located approximately five miles from ameristar council bluffs 
in  in a lawsuit brought by the state of nebraska and joined by the state of iowa and the city of council bluffs  the federal district court reversed the nigc s decision 
the us department of the interior appealed the district court ruling  and in the eighth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the nigc for further consideration 
the court of appeals directed the nigc to revisit the issue  taking into consideration  among other things  a agreement between the state of iowa and the bureau of indian affairs 
that agreement stated that the five acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs casino 
black hawk ameristar black hawk competes with other gaming operations located in the black hawk and central city gaming market in colorado 
ameristar has the largest gaming floor and parking garage of any casino in the market 
of the other casinos in the market  only four are considered large operators  with over slot machines 
ameristar s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering black hawk from denver via state route this competitor s primary casino is connected via a skywalk to an adjacent casino the operator also owns  thereby offering increased availability of hotel rooms  parking capacity and gaming positions to guests 
the black hawk and central city gaming market is insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competitors within miles 
there have been proposals for the development of native american  racetrack and video lottery terminal casinos throughout the state over the years 
none of the proposals has been adopted by the state s electorate or by the legislature 
should any form of additional gaming be authorized in the denver metropolitan area  the black hawk and central city market would be adversely affected 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg currently competes with four other gaming operations located in vicksburg  mississippi 
vicksburg is located approximately miles west of mississippi s largest city  jackson 
proposals have been made from time to time to develop new native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market 
none are under construction currently 
the vicksburg market also faces competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg  as well as casinos located along the mississippi gulf coast 
east chicago ameristar east chicago s core competitive market of northwest indiana is comprised of three casino operators  including ameristar  in east chicago  hammond and gary  indiana 
the three properties are located within five miles of each other on lake michigan 
the property also competes with seven other casinos located in illinois  indiana and michigan within miles of east chicago 
ameristar east chicago s newest competitor began operations in july it is located in des plaines  illinois  which is approximately miles northwest of east chicago  indiana 
illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than indiana casinos 
they are also subject to gaming position limitations and a statewide indoor smoking ban 
located within the chicago metropolitan area  ameristar east chicago currently draws a majority of its guest base from illinois 
legislation attempting to further expand gaming in illinois has been considered by the illinois legislature over the years 
if enacted  ameristar east chicago could face significant additional competition 
in  the indiana department of transportation indot permanently closed the cline avenue bridge near ameristar east chicago due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge 
the closure has forced ameristar s guests to utilize alternative routes to access the property 
this has caused the property s business levels and operating results to suffer 
recently  indot has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road 
there is no assurance that this will occur 
if it does not  area surface streets are expected to be improved by indot 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with three other hotels and motels all of which also have casinos in jackpot and a native american casino near pocatello  idaho 
the native american casino operates video lottery terminals  which are similar to slot machines 
other in addition to the competition that our properties face from other casinos in their geographic markets  we also compete  to a lesser extent  with casinos in other locations  including major tourist destinations such as las vegas  with gaming on cruise ships and with other forms of gaming in the united states  including state sponsored lotteries  racetracks  off track wagering  internet and other account wagering and card parlors 
employees and labor relations as of february   we employed approximately  full time and  part time employees 
approximately employees at our east chicago property are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our employee relations are good

other jurisdictions we expect to be subject to rigorous regulatory standards  which may or may not be similar to the foregoing standards  in each jurisdiction in which we may seek to conduct gaming operations in the future 
there can be no assurance that statutes or regulations adopted or fees and taxes imposed by other jurisdictions will permit us to operate profitably

item a 
risk factors our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the weak economic conditions currently being experienced in the united states  as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our guests 
we are not able to predict the length or severity of the current economic climate 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased or continuing high unemployment  significant increases in energy and automobile fuel prices  perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions  the protracted disruption in the housing markets  the availability of credit  perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth including declines resulting from any increase in personal income tax rates and changes in consumer confidence in the economy may continue to reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 
we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt  leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
we currently have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt  including discount  was billion 
under generally accepted accounting principles  our total liabilities exceed our total assets 
subject to specified limitations  the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in permits us to incur substantial additional debt 
in addition  as of december   our senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to an additional million as revolving loans after giving effect to the outstanding letters of credit 
our substantial debt and any additional debt we may incur to expand our business or otherwise could have important consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  exposing our cash flows to changes in floating rates of interest such that an increase in floating rates would negatively impact our cash flows  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
to some extent  our ability to generate future cash flow is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  the ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facility in the future will depend on our satisfying the financial covenants in the agreement governing the facility 
we cannot assure that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
covenant restrictions under our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes may limit our ability to operate our business 
the agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in contain covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture are subject to various exceptions  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facility and the indenture 
if an event of default under our senior credit facility occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive  and we face dynamic competitive pressures in our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain guests 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
in  the kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties 
at that time  one casino and one racetrack location were authorized in wyandotte county in the greater kansas city market 
the owner of the potential racetrack slot machine parlor license surrendered its racing license and closed the facility due to concerns about the tax rate that would apply to its gaming operations  which was substantially higher than the tax rate in missouri or applicable to kansas freestanding casinos 
the future status of the racetrack license is uncertain  however  there have been discussions about reducing the tax rate in order to incentivize the installation of slot machines at the racetracks 
on february   a partnership that includes a major commercial casino operator opened the first phase of a large land based casino and entertainment facility at the kansas speedway  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
this facility will provide significant additional competition for the kansas city market and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of ameristar kansas city 
our east chicago property currently competes with eight other casino gaming facilities in the chicagoland market in indiana and illinois and with one native american casino in michigan 
one of our property s principal competitors is located in hammond  indiana  which is closer to and has significantly better access for customers who live in chicago  illinois and the chicago suburbs that are the primary feeder markets for ameristar east chicago 
in  the hammond facility opened a million expansion that has adversely affected our property s business  particularly table games and poker  and we expect will continue to do so 
the tenth and final illinois casino license was awarded to a developer for a property in des plaines  illinois  located approximately miles from ameristar east chicago 
that facility opened in july and has resulted in increased competition for ameristar east chicago 
from time to time  the illinois legislature has also considered other forms of gaming expansion in the state 
the most recent was a bill that was passed by the legislature in but not signed into law by the governor 
it would have authorized a large scale expansion of casino gaming in chicago and throughout the state 
it is likely that a similar effort will be made again in the future 
if illinois materially expands gaming  particularly in downtown chicago or the south chicago suburbs  the additional competition would materially adversely affect the financial performance of ameristar east chicago 
the expansion of gaming in southern illinois would also have an adverse effect on ameristar st 
charles 
over the years  several attempts have been made in the indiana legislature to allow one of the two adjacent riverboat casino licenses held by the same operator in gary  indiana  approximately five miles from ameristar east chicago  to be moved to a nearby land based location 
none of the efforts has been successful  but it is possible such a measure will be introduced in the future 
if a casino is allowed to relocate inland to a more accessible location  it could materially adversely affect the financial performance of ameristar east chicago 
in  a competitor opened a new casino in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles  and in the same competitor opened an additional casino facility in southeastern st 
louis county  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the new facilities have resulted in significant additional competition for ameristar st 
charles that has adversely impacted its business 
in september  the competitor announced a planned expansion of the southeastern st 
louis county facility to include a room hotel  an event center and a parking garage 
the expansion is slated for completion in late in addition  if legislation is enacted in illinois to permit the operation of slot machines at racetracks  ameristar st 
charles would face additional competition from the racetrack near downtown st 
louis 
over the years  several attempts have been made in the colorado legislature to authorize video lottery terminals vlts within the state 
vlts are very similar in appearance and performance to casino slot machines 
a bill to authorize vlts has been introduced this year as well 
if vlts are authorized in colorado  they would represent additional competition for ameristar black hawk and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the property 
recently  the operator of a casino in reno  nevada agreed to purchase one of ameristar black hawk s larger competitors in the market  which has been operating in bankruptcy 
it is possible that the facility will become more competitive following the closing of the purchase 
several attempts have been made in the nebraska legislature to expand gaming in the state 
none of those efforts has been successful 
if casino gaming is authorized in the omaha area  it could have a material adverse impact on ameristar council bluffs business 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
in december  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to have a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa  located approximately five miles from ameristar council bluffs  approved for the operation of gaming 
in december  in a lawsuit brought by the state of nebraska and joined by the state of iowa and the city of council bluffs  the federal district court reversed the nigc s decision 
the us department of the interior appealed the district court ruling  and in october the eighth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the nigc for further consideration 
the court of appeals directed the nigc to revisit the issue  taking into consideration  among other things  a agreement between the state of iowa and the bureau of indian affairs 
that agreement stated that the five acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs business 
the nigc has yet to publicly render a decision on this matter 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
the law in this area has been rapidly evolving  and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of internet gaming in the united states 
our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking 
legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions  including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
effective january   a colorado smoking ban was extended to include casino floors 
we believe this ban has significantly negatively impacted business volumes in all colorado gaming markets 
in april  voters in the city of kansas city approved a ballot measure  which was subsequently modified by the city council  that prohibits smoking in most indoor public places within the city  including restaurants  but which contains an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
one of ameristar kansas city s competitors is not subject to a smoking ban in any form  which we believe has had some negative impact on our business 
on july   a statewide indoor smoking ban went into effect in the state of iowa 
the law includes an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
from time to time  bills have been introduced in the iowa legislature that would eliminate the casino floor exemption 
nevada has a statewide indoor smoking ban  with exemptions for the gaming areas of casinos and bars where prepared food is not served 
in january  a statewide indoor smoking ban was passed by the indiana house that provides an exemption for the entire footprint of casino properties 
it is not yet certain if this bill will become law and  if so  whether the casino exemption will remain in the bill 
similar bills have been introduced from time to time in the missouri legislature and the st 
charles county council 
if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly if such restrictions are applicable to casino floors  our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits  such as are currently being experienced in most states  may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri that became effective in  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
effective july   the colorado limited gaming control commission reduced all gaming tax rate tiers by  which resulted in a reduction of the top rate tier from to 
the commission has announced that it plans to reconsider the tax reduction in the spring of  and we believe it is likely that the highest rate tier will be restored to  effective july  several measures have been introduced in the current session of the missouri legislature that would raise the casino admission tax 
the proceeds would benefit the state s veterans services 
if any of the measures is enacted  it could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of ameristar kansas city and ameristar st 
charles 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
all of our outstanding debt under our senior credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   we had billion outstanding under our senior credit facility  including discount 
if short term interest rates rise from current levels  our interest cost would increase  which would adversely affect our net income and available cash 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the indiana gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our gaming licenses in missouri and colorado must be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa and indiana must be renewed every year and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
holders of our common stock may be subject to gaming regulatory requirements or could be forced to sell their shares 
all of the jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities have regulations requiring owners of more than a specified percentage of our outstanding stock to notify gaming regulatory authorities  provide information or certifications to those authorities and  in some cases  apply for a finding of suitability or license 
the threshold level of ownership for such requirements in some jurisdictions is as low as of our outstanding common stock  although exceptions or reduced requirements may be applicable for timely submissions by holders who generally qualify as institutional investors as defined in that jurisdiction and own not more than of our stock 
the specific qualifications vary by jurisdiction  but the lack of intent to exercise control over the company or its operations  by itself  is not a sufficient basis for exception or reduced requirements in some jurisdictions 
for more information  see item business government regulation 
owners of sufficient percentages of our common stock who do not or cannot comply with these requirements may be compelled to dispose of their common stock quickly and at a time at which they do not desire to do so 
any such sales by a significant holder of common stock  and the regulatory disincentives to acquire significant ownership positions  could affect the trading price of our common stock 
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate  or other conditions that restrict access to our properties  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our guests from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business may also be adversely affected by other events or conditions that restrict access to our properties  such as road closures 
in december  the indiana department of transportation indot announced that it was permanently closing the cline avenue bridge near ameristar east chicago due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge 
the closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient  relative to our competitors  for many of ameristar east chicago s guests and has significantly impacted the property s financial results 
we expect this to continue unless and until improved access is developed 
recently  indot has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road 
there can be no assurance that this will occur or  if it does  as to how the imposition of tolls may affect visitation to ameristar east chicago 
if the bridge is not rebuilt  area surface streets are expected to be improved by indot 
in black hawk  a project to widen a mile long stretch of state route near ameristar black hawk to four lanes began in late and is expected to last until august this project has created some inconvenience for guests of ameristar black hawk and may continue to adversely affect its business levels while it is ongoing 
in november  the missouri department of transportation awarded a contract for a major renovation of the westbound span of the blanchette bridge  which carries interstate over the missouri river near ameristar st 
charles 
during the project  the westbound span of the bridge will be closed for up to one year and westbound traffic will be diverted to the eastbound span  which will carry three lanes in each direction  compared to the current five lanes in each direction 
preliminary work has begun to prepare for the bridge closure  with lanes and highway ramps closed intermittently for brief intervals 
the timing of the bridge closure has not yet been announced  but it is not expected to begin prior to november the project will create an inconvenience for guests of ameristar st 
charles and we expect it will materially adversely affect its business levels while it is ongoing 
we have limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties 
several of our properties  particularly ameristar st 
charles  are located near historically active earthquake faults 
in the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have limited opportunities to develop or acquire new properties 
the casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially attractive to us 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities which may include acquisitions of existing properties that do arise  including the gaming license that we intend to apply for in western massachusetts  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development or acquisitions 
futhermore  there can be no assurance that any future development or acquisitions that we may pursue will be profitable 
the continued payment of dividends on our stock is dependent on a number of factors and is not assured 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
the payment of future dividends will depend upon our earnings  economic conditions  liquidity and capital requirements and other factors  including our debt leverage 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that future dividends will be paid at levels comparable to our historical distributions  if at all 
in addition  our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in impose limitations on the amount of dividends we may pay 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we may employ fast track design and construction methods in our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe the use of fast track design and construction methods may reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facility at any time is dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our adjusted ebitda  as defined in the senior credit facility agreement  during the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated adjusted ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the gaming  travel or tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel 
we depend on the continued performance of our entire senior management team 
if we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
from time to time  we have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as we recruit personnel  we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative  communicative and collegial nature 
we also employ a high degree of centralization in a generally highly decentralized industry 
these factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion  as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful within our company 
the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us 
a substantial majority of our revenues is attributable to slot machines operated by us at our casinos 
it is important that  for competitive reasons  we offer the most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our guests 
in recent years  the prices of new slot machines with additional features have escalated faster than the general rate of inflation 
furthermore  in recent years  slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games  instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines 
participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental 
such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin in or net win 
generally  a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine 
for competitive reasons  we may choose to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines 
if the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs  it could hurt our profitability 
we materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations 
technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly  and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate 
ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk 
any loss from service of our operating facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our operating facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
our riverboat and barge facilities are especially exposed to these risks and the changes in water levels 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel is drydocked on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site and expect that further steps will be necessary to stabilize the site in order to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of an operating facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility in an amount that we are unable to reasonably accurately estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our senior credit facility 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control of ameristar could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facility and the obligation to offer to repurchase our senior unsecured notes 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay or refinance any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
we are subject to non gaming regulation 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of under various federal  state and local laws and regulations  an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property  regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of  or is responsible for  the presence of such substances or wastes 
we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations 
however  certain of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years 
as a consequence  it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that  as a result  environmental issues could arise in the future  the precise nature of which we cannot now predict 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us treasury department require us to report currency transactions in excess of  occurring within a gaming day  including identification of the patron by name and social security number 
us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity  including any transaction that exceeds  if we know  suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements 
substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations 
our riverboats must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
in addition  we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity 
our casino barges also must meet local fire safety standards 
we would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations 
we are also subject to a variety of other federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those relating to zoning  construction  land use  employment  marketing and advertising and the sale of alcoholic beverages 
if we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the imposition of a substantial penalty or the loss of service of a gaming facility for a significant period of time would have a material adverse effect on our business

our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit 
additionally  our operating results may be affected by  among other things  overall economic conditions impacting the disposable income of our guests  weather conditions affecting our properties  achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies  competitive factors  gaming tax increases and other regulatory changes  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities and general public sentiment regarding travel 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality  variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 
historically  our fourth quarter is weaker than other periods due mostly to the combined effects of inclement weather and guest visitation and spending patterns between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays 
the following significant factors and trends should be considered in relation to our operating performance general economic conditions 
over the last few years  the weak economic conditions have adversely impacted our business volumes and the amount our guests spend at our properties 
however  we have recently seen some indications of stability 
additionally  we have implemented operating and marketing efficiencies and significantly reduced our cost structure in response to the weak economic conditions 
these enhancements have improved our operating margins 
estate stock repurchase and debt refinancing 
following the execution of a binding letter agreement entered into on february   on march  we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with the estate of craig h 
neilsen the estate  our then majority stockholder  to purchase  shares of our common stock held by the estate at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  the repurchase transaction 
the repurchase transaction was completed on april  and reduced our outstanding shares by approximately 
on april   we obtained billion of new debt financing the debt refinancing 
proceeds from the debt refinancing were used to i repurchase substantially all of our outstanding senior notes due the notes  including payment of the tender premium and accrued interest  ii prepay and permanently retire all of the indebtedness under our prior senior secured credit facility  iii complete the repurchase transaction and iv pay related fees and expenses 
the debt refinancing extended the maturities of all of our debt and significantly reduced the principal amortization previously required under our debt agreements for the years ending december  and as a result of these transactions  in the second quarter we recorded on a pre tax basis an million loss on early retirement of debt 
stock repurchase program 
on september   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in a stock repurchase program 
the program provides that we may repurchase the shares through september  in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares  or of our outstanding stock  under the program for million at an average price of per share  exclusive of commissions paid 
debt and interest expense 
at december   total debt was billion 
excluding the incurrence of and application of proceeds from the new debt in the debt refinancing  net debt repayments totaled million during  equaling approximately one third of the incremental debt from the debt refinancing 
since the debt refinancing and repurchase transaction  net repayments included million in repayments of a portion of the principal balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million for the quarterly amortization payments under the b term loan 
as of december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
consolidated net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased when compared to by million  or 
our interest expense decreased significantly in primarily as a result of the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in july and the lower interest rates achieved through the april debt refinancing 
in  consolidated net interest expense increased by million  or  compared to  as a result of a senior credit facility amendment  senior secured notes issuance and extension of our revolving loan facility that all took place in net interest expense also increased due to a decrease in capitalized interest from million in to million in  primarily due to the completion of the ameristar black hawk hotel 
ameristar east chicago 
in the fourth quarter of  the indiana department of transportation indot closed the cline avenue highway bridge near our property due to safety concerns 
the bridge closure has adversely impacted access to our property and our business volumes 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million on an after tax basis for the impairment of goodwill related to our east chicago property acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we recorded another non cash charge of million million on an after tax basis for the impairment of goodwill and the gaming license 
the property s net revenues stabilized in the fourth quarter of and have increased year over year for the year ended december  recently  indot has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road 
at this time  it is unclear if the bridge will in fact be rebuilt  the timing of this project or  if the bridge is rebuilt  how the imposition of tolls may affect visitation to ameristar east chicago 
if the bridge is not rebuilt  area surface streets are expected to be improved by indot

in july  positive statewide regulatory changes became effective in black hawk 
the regulatory changes extended casino operating hours from hours daily to hours daily  increased the maximum single bet limit from to up to and allowed for the additional table games of roulette and craps 
also  in september  we opened a room luxury hotel and spa featuring upscale furnishings and amenities 
the hotel includes a versatile meeting and ballroom center and has black hawk s only full service spa and an enclosed rooftop swimming pool with indoor outdoor whirlpool facilities 
ameristar black hawk offers destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unequaled in the denver gaming market 
as a result of these regulatory changes and the opening of the new hotel  net revenues and operating income increased year over year in by and  respectively  compared to the property also increased its annual market share on a year over year basis from to

liquidity on april   we obtained billion of new debt financing  consisting of a billion senior secured credit facility the new credit facility and million principal amount of unsecured senior notes due the notes 
the new credit facility consists of i a million a term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in  ii a million b term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in and iii a million revolving loan facility  million of which was borrowed at closing and which matures in upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  we have the option to increase the total amount available under the new credit facility by up to the greater of an additional million or an amount determined by reference to our total net leverage ratio as defined in the new credit facility agreement 
the a term loan and the revolving loan facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus per annum or the base rate plus per annum  at our option 
the b term loan bears interest at libor subject to a libor floor of plus per annum or the base rate subject to a base rate floor of plus per annum  at our option 
the libor margin for the a term loan and the revolving loan facility is subject to reduction based on our total net leverage ratio 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility of per annum  which is subject to reduction based on the total net leverage ratio 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  with the initial interest payment made on october  the notes mature on april  the new credit facility agreement requires certain mandatory principal repayments prior to maturity for both term loans 
the a term loan requires the following principal amortization in  in  in  in  and the remaining in the b term loan requires mandatory principal reductions of per annum  with the remaining due at maturity 
in addition to the scheduled mandatory principal repayments of the term loans  the new credit facility agreement also requires permanent principal repayments of the term loans equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the new credit facility agreement if our total net leverage ratio is above at year end 
excess cash flow repayments are required to be made days after the last day of each fiscal year and are allocated between both term loans on a pro rata basis 
we expect the excess cash flow repayment for the year ended december  to be approximately million 
proceeds from the debt refinancing were used to i repurchase substantially all of our senior notes due the notes tendered pursuant to our tender offer announced on march   including payment of the tender premium and accrued interest  ii prepay and permanently retire all of the indebtedness under our prior credit facility  iii complete the repurchase transaction on april  for an aggregate purchase price of million and iv pay related fees and expenses 
in connection with the debt refinancing  we paid one time fees and expenses totaling approximately million  most of which was capitalized and will be amortized over the respective remaining terms of the notes and new credit facility 
during the quarter ended june   approximately million relating to the tender premium and deferred debt issuance costs were expensed as a result of the early retirement of debt 
during  we used million of our operating cash flow to repay amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility  equaling approximately one third of the incremental debt from the debt refinancing 
as of december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
all mandatory principal payments have been made through december  our interest expense decreased significantly in primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in july and the lower interest rates achieved through the debt refinancing 
on september   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through september  during  we repurchased a total of approximately million shares of common stock  or of our total outstanding stock  under the program at an average price of per share  exclusive of commissions paid  for a total cost of million 
in addition to the availability under the new credit facility  we had million of cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately million to million of which were required for daily operations 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet our operations and liquidity requirements  we will be required to seek additional financing that would likely be more expensive than the new credit facility and or scale back our capital plans or reduce other expenditures 
any loss from service of our properties for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations in the last three years

our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our revolving loan facility 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes thereto

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
other intangible assets include gaming licenses  trade names and player lists 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
we test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
we perform the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test 
we consider both positive and negative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry events  financial performance and other changes  and make a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount 
if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than the carrying amount  we are required to perform a two step quantitative impairment test 
if  based on the qualitative analysis  the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount  we are not required to perform the two step impairment test 
under the two step quantitative assessment  goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit 
under the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one  step two of the impairment test is performed 
in step two  we determine the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge 
we test our gaming license indefinite lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
guest rewards programs our guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests gaming activity 
guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
the accruals are based on historical data  estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards 
the retail value of the point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
cash  hotel and food coupons our gaming guests may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash  hotel and food coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee health coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
we consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
in  the company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider 
the company currently has million deposited in a trust account as collateral for the company s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the self retained portion of our workers compensation claims 
accounting for share based compensation all share based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides services in exchange for the award 
the fair value of each time vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  while the fair value of market performance based stock options is calculated using the monte carlo simulation model 
the models require estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant 
we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and update that number based on actual forfeitures 
income taxes our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of asc  which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step i occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based on its technical merits  is more likely than not ie  the likelihood of occurrence is greater than to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step ii is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained 
under step ii  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
the tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard 
if it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard  it is required that the tax position be derecognized 
as applicable  we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are in accordance with accounting standards regarding contingencies and are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events  as well as upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates

 entertainment casinos topic accruals for casino jackpot liabilities the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued asu no 
 entertainment casinos topic accruals for casino jackpot liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities or portions thereof before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount 
jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot 
this guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
the guidance became effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  as required under this guidance  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption 
under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption  we reduced our recorded accrual by million million net of tax with a corresponding cumulative effect increase to retained earnings

the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the early adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facility 
outstanding amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin  or add on 
as of december   we had billion outstanding under our senior credit facility  which represents approximately of our total outstanding debt  bearing interest at variable rates indexed to one month libor  based on our election 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding was 
an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost and reduce our pre tax income by million 
the remaining of our debt outstanding as of december   primarily consisting of our senior notes due  bears interest at fixed rates 
we have used interest rate swap agreements in the past to manage interest rate risk 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of the interest rate swaps 
we may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements from time to time in the future  although we have no current intention to do so 
should we elect to use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates in the future  we would be exposed to the potential failure of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we would seek to minimize this risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with highly rated commercial banks
