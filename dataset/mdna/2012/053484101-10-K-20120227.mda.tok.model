item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note  or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment 
if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes  we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds  related margins  liquidity and access to capital markets 
there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt 
these ratings are based on a number of factors  which include their assessment of our financial strength  liquidity  capital structure  asset quality amount of real estate under development  and sustainability of cash flow and earnings  among other factors 
if market conditions change  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings  which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins  liquidity  and access to capital markets 
we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 
fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of secured financing to the multifamily industry and we have used fannie mae and freddie mac for a portion of our financing needs 
in february  the obama administration released a report calling for the winding down of the role that fannie mae and freddie mac play in the mortgage market 
a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of multifamily community loans may adversely affect interest rates  capital availability  and the value of multifamily communities 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 
a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs  including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities  could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 
significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments  if any  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 
the form  timing and or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 
the form  timing and or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant 
the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 
we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock  in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 
we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock  as we did in the fourth quarter of taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received 
if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax  the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale 
furthermore  with respect to non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends  including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock 
in addition  the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms 
if we issue additional equity securities  the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 
difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 
federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held  acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community  and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders 
in addition  real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable 
these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 
our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities 
our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment  and our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate 
failure to succeed in new markets  or with new brands and community formats  or in activities other than the development  ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 
we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience in our existing markets in developing  owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets  should we choose to enter them 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets  including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
although we are primarily in the multifamily business  we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space  as is often the case with large urban in fill developments 
we also may engage or have an interest in for sale activity 
we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences 
we cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings 
land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 
we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop 
as discussed in item  communities other land and real estate assets  in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcel s then current fair value  less costs to dispose  we would be subject to an impairment charge  which would reduce our net income 
risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 
instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly  at times we invest as a partner or a co venturer 
joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks  including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due  that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses  that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours  and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests 
frequently  we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy sell arrangement  which could cause us to sell our interest  or acquire our partner s interest  at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 
risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds 
we formed fund i and fund ii  in which we have an equity interest of and  respectively  which  through wholly owned subsidiaries  we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested an aggregate of approximately  net of distributions to us at december  the investment period for both funds is over 
these funds present risks  including the following our subsidiaries that are the general partners of the funds are generally liable  under partnership law  for the debts and obligations of the respective funds  subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the funds  investors in the funds holding a majority of the partnership interests may remove us as the general partner without cause  subject to our right to receive an additional nine months of management fees after such removal and our right to acquire one of the properties then held by the funds  while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds  the investors or an advisory committee comprised of representatives of the investors must approve certain matters  and as a result we may be unable to cause the funds to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial  and we may be liable and or our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the funds  or the reits through which a number of investors have invested in the funds and which we manage  fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters 
risk of earthquake damage 
as further described in item  communities insurance and risk of uninsured losses  many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults 
we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels 
in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits  we could lose our capital invested in the affected community  as well as anticipated future revenue from that community 
we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community 
any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity 
as a result  we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above  we carry commercial general liability insurance  property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured  in full or in part  because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur  we could lose our capital invested in a community  as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community 
we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community 
if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur  we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with  or court ordered damages to  that third party 
a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 
particularly in new england  the new york and new jersey metro area and the midwest  we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather  including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction 
in addition  inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 
we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non compliance 
under various federal  state and local environmental and public health laws  regulations and ordinances  we may be required  regardless of knowledge or responsibility  to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property  personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination 
these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination  may adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent the affected property 
in addition  some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 
the development  construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances  which regulate matters including wetlands protection  storm water runoff and wastewater discharge 
noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 
certain federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms 
we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed 
acms were  however  used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired 
we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 
we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 
we are also aware that environmental agencies and third parties have  in the case of certain properties with on site or nearby contamination  asserted claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 
we currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 
all of our stabilized operating communities  and all of the communities that we are currently developing  have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment  which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling 
these assessments  together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties  have not revealed  and we are not otherwise aware of  any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  financial condition or results of operations 
in connection with our ownership  operation and development of communities  from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants  including contaminants in soil  groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings 
in some cases  an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates 
there can be no assurance  however  that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified  in full or at all  in the event that environmental liability arises 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures  and the need to remediate such mold  is not a new phenomenon  there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects  including allergic or other reactions 
to help limit mold growth  we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture 
we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented 
however  we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner 
if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 
additionally  we have occasionally been involved in developing  managing  leasing and operating various properties for third parties 
consequently  we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and  therefore  potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 
we cannot assure you that the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities  no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments  no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared  the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities  such as the presence of underground storage tanks  will not affect the environmental condition of our communities  future uses or conditions  including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations  will not result in the imposition of environmental liability  and no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability 
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel 
our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry  and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 
breaches of our data security could materially harm our business and reputation 
we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our tenants and employees 
while we have implemented a variety of security measures to protect the confidentiality of this information and periodically review and improve our security measures  there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information 
any breach of our data security measures and loss of this information may result in legal liability and costs including damages and penalties  as well as damage to our reputation  that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance 
failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation  which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
in addition  unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification 
the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
furthermore  we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
thus  our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit  and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit  or that we will remain qualified in the future 
this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
in addition  future legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
even if we qualify as a reit  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  we may engage in activities that are not customarily provided by a landlord through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 
there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the following our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights  including voting rights  of any series of preferred stock issued 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 
to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year 
to maintain this qualification  and or to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock  our charter generally prohibits ownership directly  indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  or beneficially as defined in section of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock 
in general  under our charter  pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock 
under our charter  our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons  but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit 
these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 
our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director 
in a contested election  if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast  the incumbent directors would remain in office 
this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 
as a maryland corporation  we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law 
maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur  which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers  even if they are in our stockholders best interests 
in addition  other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that  if made or taken  could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item communities our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
the following is a description of each category current communities are categorized as established  other stabilized  lease up  or redevelopment according to the following attributes established communities also known as same store communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful  as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 
for the year ended december   the established communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes  had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of january   are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year 
a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment 
other stabilized communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in  and that have stabilized occupancy  as defined above 
other stabilized communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year 
lease up communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 
redevelopment communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
for communities that we wholly own  redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of  or of the community s capitalized cost and is expected to have a material impact on the community s operations and future rental rates 
the occupancy levels of redevelopment communities may also be impacted to the extent we take multiple apartment homes out of service for an extended period of time 
the definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement  or by one of the funds 
development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community 
these communities may be partially complete and operating 
development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest  for which we are the buyer under a long term conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community 
we capitalize related pre development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 
as of december   communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows number of communities number of apartment homes current communities established communities new england metro ny nj mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total established other stabilized communities new england metro ny nj mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total other stabilized lease up communities redevelopment communities total current communities development communities development rights in addition to the eight communities indicated  the company commenced the redevelopment of five communities with an aggregate of apartment homes during  for which at december  the redevelopment activity is focused on the common area and is not impacting community operations  including occupancy or rental revenue 
these communities are therefore included in the established community portfolio 
our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 
current communities our current communities include garden style apartment communities consisting of multi story buildings in landscaped settings  as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings 
as of january   our current communities consisted of garden style of which are mixed communities and or include town homes  high rise and mid rise apartment communities 
our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features  which may include fully equipped kitchens  lofts and vaulted ceilings  walk in closets  fireplaces  patios decks  and modern appliances 
other features at various communities may include swimming pools  fitness centers  tennis courts  and wi fi lounges 
as described in item  in late we announced the introduction of two new brands to supplement our core avalon offering  which remains focused on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services 
ava will target customers in high energy  transit served urban neighborhoods and will feature smaller apartments  many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus 
eaves by avalon is targeted to the cost conscious  value segment and will likely be concentrated in older assets in suburban areas 
we believe that the addition of these new brands will allow us to further penetrate our existing markets  by segmenting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 
we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes 
the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team  focused on the specific needs of residents  enhances market appeal to discriminating residents 
we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 
our current communities are located in the following geographic markets number of communities at number of apartment homes at percentage of total apartment homes at new england boston  ma fairfield county  ct metro ny nj long island  ny northern new jersey central new jersey new york  ny mid atlantic midwest washington  dc chicago  il pacific northwest seattle  wa northern california oakland east bay  ca san francisco  ca san jose  ca southern california los angeles  ca orange county  ca san diego  ca we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities 
during the year ended december   we completed construction of  apartment homes in six communities  sold  apartment homes in five communities  and exchanged three communities with  apartment homes for six communities with  apartment homes with another apartment owner 
the average age of our current communities  on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes  is years 
when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity  as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date  the average age of our current communities is years 
of the current communities  as of january   we owned a full fee simple  or absolute  ownership interest in operating communities  ten of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in october  november  december  december  april  september  april  may and march  a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in both fund i and fund ii 
subsidiaries of fund i own a fee simple interest in operating communities  and subsidiaries of fund ii own a fee simple interest in operating communities  a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a downreit  as described more fully below  that owns one community  a membership interest in five limited liability companies  that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community  and a residual profits interest with no ownership interest in a limited liability company to which an operating community was transferred upon completion of construction in the second quarter of for some communities  a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration 
we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october  november  december and april we also hold  directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries  the full fee simple ownership interest in of the development communities and a leasehold interest in three of the development communities with the land leases expiring in july  november  and may two of the three land leases those expiring in and provide options for the company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term 
in our partnership structured as a downreit  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner  and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest 
limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner 
under the partnership agreement for the downreit  the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount 
the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock 
in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership  we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount 
as of january   there were  downreit partnership units outstanding 
the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes

we expect these development communities  when completed  to add a total of  apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost  including land acquisition costs  of approximately  in addition  the land for three development communities that we control under long term land lease agreements are subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately  per year in aggregate

total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership  either during construction or upon construction completion  represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount 
future initial occupancy dates are estimates 
there can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments 
stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of or greater physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of development 
development community subject to a long term ground lease 
redevelopment communities as of december   we had consolidated communities  including two phases of a community being redeveloped under a single project  under redevelopment 
we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be  excluding costs prior to redevelopment 
we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community 
accordingly  for redevelopment communities we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community 
we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations  or that we will meet our budgeted costs  either individually or in the aggregate 
we anticipate continuing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio

restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of or greater physical occupancy or ii the one year anniversary of completion of redevelopment 
the scope of the work completed during did not impact the occupancy or rental income therefore these communities are included in the established community portfolio 
the scope of work includes apartment homes at the first phase of this community and apartment homes at the second phase 
development rights at december   we had  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own  and  in capitalized costs including legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel  typically through an option to purchase or lease the land 
collectively  the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future 
the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december  includes  in original land acquisition costs 
we also have  in future land acquisition costs under our commitment  related to a development right in brooklyn  ny  as discussed under off balance sheet arrangements elsewhere within this form k 
the original land acquisition cost per home  including our obligation under the commitment  ranged from  per home in connecticut to  per home in new york city 
the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately 
we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately  apartment homes to our portfolio 
substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 
for development rights  we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel 
while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land  for the remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 
the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process 
the decisions regarding the initial selection of a development right  and whether or not to continue to invest in a development right  are business judgments that we make after we perform financial  demographic and other analyses 
in the event that we do not proceed with a development right  we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities  unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land  however  we cannot guarantee a recovery 
initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are charged to expense 
during  we incurred a charge of approximately  of pre development cost for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred  or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed

other land and real estate assets we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately  that we do not currently plan to develop 
these parcels consist of land that we i originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop  as more fully described below 
i the land that we originally acquired for future development has an original cost of  and a current carrying value of  and is comprised of four parcels originally intended for the development of approximately  apartment homes 
the current carrying value of these land parcels reflects impairment charges of  incurred in and prior periods 
ii the out parcels and certain other land parcels that we acquired in connection with various development pursuits without a view to developing have a current carrying value of  which reflects impairment charges of  incurred in prior periods 
we believe that the current carrying value of  for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value  or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired 
however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment  and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value  less costs to dispose 
recent disposition activity we i sell assets when they do not meet our long term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop  redevelop and acquire communities 
pending such redeployment  we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development activity 
on occasion  we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred  like kind exchange transaction 
from january  to january   we sold our interest in three wholly owned communities  containing  apartment homes 
the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities 
these policies  and other insurance policies we carry  have policy specifications  insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured  in full or in part  because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it  in management s view  economically impractical 
you should carefully review the discussion under item a  risk factors  of this form k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 
many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults 
many of our communities are near  and thus susceptible to  the major fault lines in california  including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault 
we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels 
we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington  for any single occurrence and in the aggregate   of coverage 
earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a  limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate 
in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building 
our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a  deductible per occurrence except that the next  of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional self insured retention until the total incurred self insured retention exceeds  on january   we elected to extend our property insurance policy for a new month term in order to take advantage of market conditions 
as a result  our property insurance premium decreased by approximately with no material changes in coverage 
market conditions in are less favorable than when we last renewed our property insurance coverage and we expect an increase in insurance costs when we renew this policy in may just as with office buildings  transportation systems and government buildings  there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism 
in december  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back stop program until in connection with this legislation  we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to  additionally  we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts  not covered under tripra  such as domestic based terrorism 
this insurance  often referred to as non certified terrorism insurance  is subject to deductibles  limits and exclusions 
our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 
an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth 
mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities  we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 
for further discussion of the risks and the company s related prevention and remediation activities  please refer to the discussion under item a  risk factors we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non compliance  elsewhere in this report 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 
we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company  up to  per occurrence  from employee theft of money  securities or property 
item legal proceedings the company is involved in various claims and or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
while no assurances can be given  the company does not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

ebitda is defined as net income before interest income and expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization from both continuing and discontinued operations 
under this definition  ebitda includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests 
management generally considers ebitda to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we generally consider funds from operations  or ffo  as defined below  to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 
consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  we calculate ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities  extraordinary gains or losses as defined by gaap  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets  write downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates  depreciation of real estate assets  and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in january  nareit modified the definition of ffo to exclude impairment write downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates 
our ffo has been restated to reflect this new guidance  to include an adjustment of  related to our proportionate share of an impairment write down of an affiliate due to the decrease in value of depreciable real estate assets 
ffo does not represent net income in accordance with gaap  and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income  which remains the primary measure  as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo 
ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a presentation of gaap based cash flow metrics is provided in cash flow information in the table on the previous page

capitalized terms used without definitions have the meaning as provided elsewhere in this form k 
executive overview business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we believe that apartment communities are an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments  because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research  consumer insight  and capital allocation  delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best performing submarkets of the united states 
our communities are predominately upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are currently located in new england  the new york new jersey metro area  the mid atlantic  the midwest  the pacific northwest  and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 
at the present time  we are no longer pursuing development or acquisition opportunities in the midwest region  and we are currently marketing for sale  or have executed a sales contract  for two apartment communities  which includes one for fund i  and a land parcel located in that region 
should these assets sell during  we would no longer have an investment interest in the midwest region 
financial highlights and outlook for the year ended december   net income attributable to common stockholders was  compared to  for  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to increased gains on sale of communities in as compared to as well as from an increase in net operating income noi from both established and newly stabilized communities 
apartment fundamentals improved throughout as compared to  driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate  modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product 
full year established communities noi increased over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue and a decrease in operating expenses 
we expect that earnings per share diluted eps will increase to between and for from in  driven primarily by expected gains from the disposition of real estate and the continued improvement in revenue and noi from our established communities in this positive outlook is as of the date that this form k is filed and reflects our expectations for i moderate  but accelerated job growth and population growth  particularly in the age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent  ii the expected weak but moderating conditions in the for sale housing market during  and iii constrained levels of new supply 
our current financial outlook for provides for growth in rental revenue of between and in our established community portfolio resulting in a projected noi growth for our established communities of to 
expense growth also impacts growth in noi  and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth 
we expect operating expenses to increase between and in over these projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in  both nationally and in the markets where we operate  the individual demand supply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate and assessment of each community s potential performance for the upcoming year 
we do not undertake a duty to update our outlook  and there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and or their impact on our operating results will be accurate  and actual results could differ materially 
please see risk factors  forward looking statements and other discussions in this report on form k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 
during  we successfully raised approximately  of capital through sales of common equity in the public markets and asset sales 
proceeds were used to fund current investment activities  prefund planned investment activity  and combined with cash already on hand  to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt  while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes 
we believe that our current capital structure will provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 
the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities and three land parcels for a gross sales price of  we expect to see continued strong investor demand for quality multifamily assets in  due in part to the liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply of quality multifamily assets resulting from the decline in development activity in and in all markets 
we increased development activity during from the prior year in anticipation of the further improvement in the economy and apartment fundamentals  and believe that our development activity will continue to create long term value 
during  we completed the development of six communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of  which represents a savings from the original budgeted capitalized cost of  we started the development of communities  which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of  in addition  during we completed the redevelopment of seven communities for a total investment of  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 
during  we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the favorable market conditions expected in and we anticipate new development starts in with a total projected capitalized cost of  to  during  we expect to invest between  and  related to the communities under development at december   new development starts  and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development 
consistent with this view  we also expect to maintain our current level of redevelopment activity for our wholly owned communities in  during which we expect to start redevelopment of five wholly owned communities  and invest between  and  in the redevelopment of communities 
we believe that our current level of indebtedness  our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provides us with flexibility in our capital raising activities 
we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt and or common and preferred equity and or secured debt  as well as from disposition proceeds  joint venture investments or from retained cash and that these sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during we also increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through acquisitions 
in  we completed an asset exchange with another apartment owner 
through this transaction  we exchanged three existing communities and a small land parcel for six operating communities and  in cash 
the communities we provided to our exchange counterparty consisted of two properties and a small land parcel located in metropolitan boston and one property located in san francisco 
in exchange we received six operating communities in southern california los angeles  orange county and san diego 
this transaction is consistent with our desire to increase our presence in southern california  providing us with a larger portfolio of assets in the region at multiple price points that we believe will perform better than other us markets over the current operating cycle 
also in  we acquired fairfax towers for our wholly owned portfolio 
fairfax towers is a high rise community consisting of apartment homes  located in falls church  va  and was acquired for a purchase price of  in february  we acquired for our wholly owned portfolio  the mark pasadena  located in pasadena  ca 
the mark pasadena contains apartment homes and was acquired for  during  we expect to be active in both acquisition and disposition activity for our wholly owned portfolio 
while this activity pertains primarily to portfolio shaping and repositioning  and is currently expected to have a nominal impact on our net capital position  we expect the dispositions to occur largely in the first half of the year and the acquisitions are expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year 
we established fund i and fund ii to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds 
we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i third party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio  ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and  potentially  incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds  and iii visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly owned portfolio 
fund i has nine institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and we have made an equity investment of approximately  in fund i net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march fund i has a term that expires in march  plus two one year extension options 
during  fund i sold two communities avalon columbia  located in columbia  maryland  for  and avalon redondo beach  located in redondo beach  california  for fund i recognized an aggregate gain under gaap of  from the sale of these communities  of which our share was  in addition  fund i sold two communities in avalon lakeside  located in chicago  illinois  was sold for  and avalon at poplar creek  also located in chicago  illinois  was sold for fund ii has six institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and we have total equity commitments of  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
fund ii has a term that expires in august  plus two one year extension options 
fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle  with some exceptions  through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities until august while the investment period for fund ii closed in august  additional acquisitions may occur for active acquisition candidates identified prior to the end of the investment period 
in  we expect fund ii to acquire its final operating community  which was an active acquisition candidate at the end of the investment period for fund ii 
we will receive  in addition to any returns on our invested equity  asset management fees  property management fees and redevelopment fees 
we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met 
during the year ended december   subsidiaries of fund ii acquired the following four operating communities waterstone carlsbad  a garden style community consisting of apartment homes located in carlsbad san diego county  ca was acquired for a purchase price of  yale village townhomes  a garden style community consisting of townhomes located in rockville  md was acquired for a purchase price of captain parker arms  a garden style community consisting of apartment homes located in lexington  ma was acquired for a purchase price of  and highlands at rancho san diego  consisting of apartment homes located in san diego  ca was acquired for a purchase price of  in conjunction with the acquisition  fund ii extinguished an outstanding mortgage note secured by the community  incurring a prepayment penalty  of which the company s proportionate share was approximately  we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new  third fund  preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of wholly owned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 
communities overview as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and communities were under reconstruction 
of these communities  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes  including owned by subsidiaries of fund i and owned by subsidiaries of fund ii 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional wholly owned communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  development communities  and development rights 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities 
discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities  noi derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of noi related to disposed communities  and capital market and financing activity

noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
reconciliations of noi for the years ended december   and to net income for each year  are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income indirect operating expenses  net of corporate income investments and investment management expense expensed development and other pursuit costs interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities depreciation expense impairment loss land holdings gain on sale of real estate assets income loss from discontinued operations net operating income the noi increases for both and  as compared to the prior year period  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands full year full year established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total the noi increase for established communities in is due to a combination of increased rental revenues and decreased operating expenses 
during  we experienced sequential quarterly increases in rental rates  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all regions 
in addition  we experienced favorable trends in operating expenses  primarily property taxes and utilities 
rental and other income increased in both and as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our established communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  homes for and  homes for the increase in over is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities  offset partially by communities sold during the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  for as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  for and decreased  or  for as compared to the prior year 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in driven by an increase in rental rates 
average economic occupancy for remained at consistent with economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 
the metro new york new jersey region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue for  experienced an increase in rental revenue of for as compared to average rental rates increased to  over and economic occupancy was unchanged at during an improving economy  favorable demographic trends and a minimal amount of competitive new supply supported positive results in over the prior year 
despite concerns about the near term recovery in the region s large financial services industry  the metro new york new jersey region has experienced growth in other sectors including technology which has supported demand for rental housing 
we anticipate the new york city market will continue to outperform suburban submarkets in new rental deliveries are expected to remain minimal in but we are anticipating completion and delivery of competitive new supply in certain new york city markets in the new england region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of to for  as compared to job growth from the region s large technology sector and a low volume of new multifamily supply contributed to the improvement in apartment market conditions 
job growth in the boston area was broad based  but southwest connecticut lagged given greater dependence on the financial services and manufacturing sectors 
similar conditions are expected in with large defense contractors headquartered in the region  the potential for job cutbacks in the defense sector may negatively impact market fundamentals in the mid atlantic midwest region  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of as compared to average rental rates increased by to  while economic occupancy decreased to for as compared to the mid atlantic region s economy  which is highly dependent on government and government contractors  is expected to underperform other regions as impacts from the current focus on controlling government spending take effect 
at the same time  a significant amount of new rental supply is expected to be delivered in and in certain submarkets which will compete with existing product 
northern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of from the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to strong renter demand is being fueled by job growth in the region s large high tech sector  unaffordable home prices and a lack of competitive new rental supply 
we expect the region s solid apartment market fundamentals will continue during we anticipate competitive new supply will be delivered in but will be limited to certain submarkets 
southern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of from the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to apartment market conditions are improving in the region as job growth resumes in line with a strengthening us economy 
we anticipate that stronger job growth in the region during  combined with minimal new supply  favorable demographics and a continued weak housing market will support stronger rental revenue growth 
the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of from the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of to for as compared to job growth in the region is broad based  driven by improvement in both aerospace and technology 
population growth and limited competition from both new rental supply and home purchases are expected to support continued strong rental revenue growth 
new rental deliveries will be modest in but we expect an increase in in certain submarkets 
management  development and other fees increased  or  in over the increase in was due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased  or in and increased  or for as compared to the prior years  primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  decreased  or to  for and increased  or for as compared to the prior year periods 
the decrease in from is due primarily to decreased administrative expenses from a decrease in bad debt expense 
savings in utilities driven by milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates also contributed to the decrease 
the decrease in from was due primarily to decreased administrative and marketing costs  offset partially by higher community maintenance expenses  including costs for repairs from storm damage 
the decreases in administrative expenses were primarily due to decreased bad debt 
property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments 
property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 
for established communities  property taxes decreased by  or and increased  or for and  respectively as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in from is due to successful appeals and settlements offset partially by a combination of rate increases and higher assessments throughout all regions 
the increase in over is due to higher assessments as well as the size and timing of successful appeals 
we expect property taxes in to increase over due primarily to higher tax rates and higher assessments 
for communities in california  property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index  with increases limited by law proposition 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  and also engage third party consultants to assist in our evaluations 
we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by  or in over the prior year 
the increase in from is due primarily to increases in compensation costs  coupled with costs associated with the company s development and introduction of the ava and eaves by avalon brands 
investments and investment management costs increased in by  or from the prior year due primarily to increases in compensation costs 
expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits 
expensed development and other pursuit costs decreased in and from the prior years due to decreases in abandoned development pursuits attributable to continued economic improvement 
these costs can be volatile  particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital  and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 
interest expense  net decreased  or and increased  or in and  respectively as compared to the prior years 
this category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income 
the decrease in from is due to a decrease in outstanding debt coupled with lower interest rates and an increase in interest costs capitalized over the increase in is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized as compared to the prior year  coupled with increased interest expense in compared to the prior year from additional secured and unsecured debt issued 
the decrease in interest capitalized in as compared to was due to the reduction in development activity in as compared to the prior year 
loss on the extinguishment of debt  net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties and expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity  or payments above or below the carrying basis 
in we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of  due to early retirement of a secured note 
the net loss in is due to the  in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium  offset by the gain recognized from our january tender offer 
depreciation expense increased in and primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity  offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during and general and administrative expense g a increased  or in and decreased  or in as compared to the prior years 
the changes in both periods are attributable to changes in compensation expense 
impairment loss for was due to an additional write down of two land parcels for which we changed our intent and determined we now intend to pursue the disposal of these assets 
in addition  the impairment charge in includes the impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture 
impairment loss for was due to the write down of land parcels which we concluded that we did not plan to develop at the time of impairment 
we did not recognize an impairment loss in gain on sale of land increased in and decreased in as compared to the prior years due to the sale of land parcels in and  without comparable activity in equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased  or in and decreased  or in as compared to prior years 
the increase in is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of two communities by fund i  offset partially by increased acquisition costs from fund ii over the decrease in is due to acquisition costs from fund ii which were not significant in income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january  through december  this income increased for and decreased for due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period 
see note  real estate disposition activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of communities increased in and as compared to the prior years as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year 
the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
the gain on sale of communities in includes  for the recapture of cumulative straight line rent expense charged in excess of cash payments for a community subject to a long term ground lease 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us for the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of  in and  in the decrease in income in relative to is due primarily to improved operating results of the fund i community we consolidate 
the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in and also contributed to the decrease in from  thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code  debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity  and normal recurring operating expenses 
factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended december   raising net proceeds of approximately  in the form of public equity including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in august and amounts issued under the cep ii discussed below 
in  we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources  including cash balances on hand  asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below  as well as our operating activities 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short term financial prospects 
at december   we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in the increase was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate expenditures and increased cash flows from community operations in as compared to investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development  redevelopment  and acquisitions 
in total  we invested  during in the following areas we invested approximately  in the development and redevelopment of communities  we invested  in the acquisition of an apartment community  we had capital expenditures of  for real estate and non real estate assets  and we made capital contributions to fund ii of  these expenditures were offset by net proceeds of  from an asset exchange and the disposition of three operating communities and three unimproved land parcels 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in the net cash provided is due primarily to the issuance of common stock  primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in august and under cep ii  for aggregate net proceeds of  partially offset by the payment of cash dividends in the amount of  repayment of  principal amount of unsecured notes  and repayment of  of secured notes including prepayment penalties 
variable rate unsecured credit facility in september  we entered into the credit facility which has an available borrowing capacity of  and a four year term  plus a one year extension option 
we may elect to expand the facility to  provided that one or more banks whether or not part of the current syndicate of banks voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment 
no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit the increase  which will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
the credit facility was entered into with a syndicate of commercial banks to whom we pay an annual facility fee of approximately  and bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit ratings 
in addition  the credit facility includes a competitive bid option  which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans to us at a rate that is lower than the stated rate provided by the credit facility for up to  the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing than the stated rate if market conditions allow 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january  the credit facility replaced our previous variable rate unsecured credit facility which had a borrowing capacity of  the cancelled credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in november financial covenants we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued 
the financial covenants include the following limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure  limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property specific financing  and minimum levels of debt service coverage 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in addition  our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance  defeasance  or prepayment penalty provisions  which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity 
these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 
continuous equity offering program cep ii in november  we commenced cep ii  under which we may sell up to  of our common stock from time to time during a month period 
actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us  including market conditions  the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding 
in conjunction with cep ii  we engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately of the gross sales price for shares sold 
for the year ended december  we sold  shares under cep ii at an average sales price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of  from program inception in november through december   we sold  shares at an average price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of underwritten public offering of common stock in august  we issued  shares of our common stock for a net price of per share before offering costs 
net proceeds of approximately  are being used for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  which may include development  redevelopment and acquisitions of apartment communities and repayment and refinancing of debt 
future financing and capital needs debt and derivative maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity 
early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
we are also party to  of forward interest rate swap agreements  which were executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in and at maturity of the agreements  we will cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value 
assuming that we issue the debt as expected  we will recognize in earnings the impact from settling these positions over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment 
our outlook for considered the expected impact for the settlement of the forward interest rate swap agreement that matures in at december  we had recorded a liability related to the value of these contracts of  approximately half of which relates to the contract expiring in the value of the contracts is subject to increase or decrease prior to their respective maturities  and the amount which we will pay or receive upon maturity will depend on market conditions at that time 
in addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we executed in august and under cep ii and the forward interest rate swap agreements discussed above  the following financing activity occurred during in march  we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in accordance with its scheduled maturity date 
as part of an asset exchange in april  we assumed a  fixed rate mortgage loan with a interest rate  and relinquished a  mortgage loan with a fixed rate 
in conjunction with the acquisition of fairfax towers in april  we assumed a fixed rate mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of  that matures in august in april  we repaid all amounts due under a  variable rate  tax exempt bond financing using the original issue proceeds which were held in escrow 
in august  we repaid a fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  at par in advance of its october scheduled maturity date 
in september  we repaid  principal amount of our unsecured notes in accordance with their scheduled maturity 
the notes had an all in interest rate of 
in october  we repaid a fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in advance of its january scheduled maturity 
as part of this transaction  we incurred charges of  for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as loss on early retirement of debt 
in november  we repaid a fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in advance of its april scheduled maturity date 
as part of this transaction  we incurred a charge of  for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as loss on early retirement of debt 
the following debt activity occurred subsequent to december  through the date this form k was filed in january  we repaid  principal amount of coupon unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity 
in february  we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in advance of its november scheduled maturity date 
also in february  in conjunction with the acquisition of a wholly owned operating community  we assumed a  note maturing in june the following table details debt maturities for the next five years  excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale  for debt outstanding at december  dollars in thousands

future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had wholly owned communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
we also had wholly owned communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from our  credit facility until it expires in  assuming execution of a one year extension option  cash currently on hand  including cash in construction escrows  invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  and short term investment vehicles  retained operating cash  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding  including joint venture activity 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the funds  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 
unconsolidated real estate investments and off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated investments as of december   we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from to

off balance sheet arrangements in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities  we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest

cvp i  llc has outstanding tax exempt  variable rate bonds maturing in november in the amount of  which have permanent credit enhancement 
we have agreed to guarantee  under limited circumstances  the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of cvp i  llc s repayment obligations under the bonds 
we have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that cvp i  llc will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project chrystie place in new york city  which is expected in our partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under these guarantees  both at inception and as of december   were not significant 
as a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at december  subsidiaries of fund i have loans  including one owned by us  secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  fund i subsidiary loans have varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid  ranging from august to september these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
the mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of fund i with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate 
we have not guaranteed the debt of fund i  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should fund i be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of fund i  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that if  upon final liquidation of fund i  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund i whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
as of december   the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund i is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund i liquidation scenario 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  subsidiaries of fund ii have loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  with maturity dates that vary from november to september the mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of fund ii with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate 
we have not guaranteed  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should fund ii be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of fund ii  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that if  upon final liquidation of fund ii  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund ii whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
as of december   the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund ii is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund ii liquidation scenario 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  each individual mortgage loan of fund i or fund ii was made to a special purpose  single asset subsidiary of the funds 
each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only  except under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or misapplication of funds in which case the respective fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan 
in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the funds  including against us or our wholly owned subsidiaries that invest in the funds 
a default by a fund or a fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non fund subsidiaries or affiliates 
if a fund subsidiary or a fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan  the value of our investment in that fund would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the fund partners in each fund as described above 
if a fund subsidiary or a fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan  we and or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the fund through additional equity contributions and or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default such as foreclosure of a fund asset 
however  we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide such voluntary support  or take such other action  as any such action would depend on a variety of factors  including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the fund s and or our returns by providing time for performance to improve

inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements  applying the applicable accounting guidance 
for investment interests that we do not consolidate  we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply 
the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
therefore  we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december   our assets would have increased by  and our liabilities would have increased by  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed  including but not limited to the following reasons  none of which are currently expected to occur for entities not considered to be variable interest entities  the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary 
for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and or variable interest  the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and or variable interest 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
for redevelopment efforts  we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed  or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities 
these costs include interest and related loan fees  property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs 
interest is capitalized for any project specific financing  as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects 
indirect project costs  which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts  are also capitalized 
capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities total   and  for   and  respectively 
the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and  as such  we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity 
if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  there may be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if in our development activities decreased by  and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs  our operating expenses would have increased by  we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community  and therefore should be capitalized  the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate 
if we had determined that of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring  net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by  abandoned pursuit costs asset impairment we evaluate our real estate and other long lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist 
such assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization  unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable  we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets  for the years ended december   and  we did not record any impairment losses for wholly owned operating real estate assets 
we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits  which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits  in the amounts of  in   in and  in these costs are included in operating expenses  excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly  and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 
we also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land 
during  we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and  as a result  that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable 
as a result  we recognized an aggregate charge of  for the impairment of these land parcels 
we had previously recognized an impairment loss of  in when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets 
our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for land holds in during  we concluded that the economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning 
this resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of  in related to the impairment of land parcels which we concluded would not be developed at the dates of the impairment 
we looked to a combination of internal models and third party pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels 
considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development  the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model 
land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using third party estimates of fair value 
for the internally generated fair values  we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community 
the cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make  including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset  as well as potential disposition proceeds 
the third party values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return  investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables  adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness 
both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as level prices in the fair value hierarchy 
we also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment  considering both the carrying value of the investment  estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated  as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 
during  we concluded that because the market for for sale housing development has not improved as expected  the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized a charge of  for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture 
there were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended december  in  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold an interest determined that the economic downturn impacted the recoverability of the carrying value of a long lived asset held as an investment 
accordingly  the joint venture recognized an impairment loss 
we recognized our proportionate share of the impairment loss of approximately  as a component of equity in income of unconsolidated entities on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed  or the likelihood of any future impairment charges  if any 
you should also review item a  risk factors of this form k 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
for example  if we failed to qualify as a reit in  our net income would have decreased by approximately  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment 
therefore  we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates 
we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily  in short term libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
in addition  the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives  as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
in the second quarter of  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on our expected issuance of debt in future periods 
in addition  we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings  convert fixed rate borrowings to floating rate borrowings  or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing 
further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements  as of and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
as of december  we had a  of forward starting pay fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge cash flow variability for future debt issuances 
in addition  we had executed receive fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately  and  of our fixed rate unsecured notes  as of december  and december   respectively 
had the receive fixed interest rate swap agreements used to hedge fair value exposure not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  higher  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  contractual fixed rate debt excluding fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately
