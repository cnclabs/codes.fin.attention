altera designs  manufactures  and markets a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuits asics transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable implementations for volume production 
because they are customized only on the last few mask layers  hardcopy asics deliver performance that can be an alternative to traditional asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
pre defined design building blocks  known as intellectual property ip cores  can be licensed by customers to add standard functions to their pld designs 
proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations  is used by customers to develop  compile  and verify their designs  and then program their designs into our plds 
we were one of the first suppliers of complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos plds and are currently a global leader in this market 
our broad range of plds offers unique features as well as differing densities and performance specifications  and serves a wide range of customers 
an overview of typical pld applications within these markets is shown in the table below

memory stores programming instructions and data 
logic manages the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system 
system designers typically use standard architectures to meet their processor and memory needs 
system differentiation may be realized through the development of software algorithms that are executed by a processor  as well as specialized hardware that has been designed into the logic circuits 
most applications use one or more of the following types of devices to implement designs asics often referred to as standard cells  asics are manufactured with custom designs created by the customer 
an asic is developed with custom logic targeted to a specific end application 
an asic may also include licensed microprocessor and memory cores which may allow limited software programmability through the modification of software algorithms that are executed on the microprocessor 
each asic has a targeted function used by a single customer in a single application 
application specific standard products assps assps are standard devices that utilize a development methodology that is similar to an asic 
however  in contrast to an asic  which is built for a single customer  an assp is built for a specific type of application targeted to a small number of customers 
assps are sometimes described as asics developed for multiple customers 
plds unlike asics and assps  plds are standard products that can be customized for a wide range of applications 
while originally developed for logic implementation  more recent pld architectures have evolved to include various memory  digital signal processing dsp  embedded microprocessor and even analog functionality 
plds are typically sold to hundreds or thousands of customers 
this flexibility offers many advantages  including simple design changes  shorter design cycles  and lower development costs 
plds vs 
asics and assps in a broad sense  plds  asics and assps compete with each other as they may be used in the same types of applications in electronic systems 
however  differences in cost  performance  density  flexibility  ease of use  and time to market dictate how much they directly compete for particular applications 
the table below summarizes key characteristics of asics  assps  and plds 
asic assp pld customizable yes  by chip fabrication facility no yes  by end user erasability reprogrammability no no yes relative time to market slow immediate fast relative unit cost low moderate moderate to high customer s development cost high low moderate field upgradability no no yes in contrast to asics  pld designs are programmed directly into the pld 
this means that the pld is fully functional and verified when the design is completed  avoiding the lengthy and complex cycles required to verify and fabricate asics 
this user programmability allows pld customers to test and revise their designs quickly and with minimal development cost 
in addition to these ease of use and time to market advantages  plds can be upgraded in the field  which allows customers to modify the pld design after the electronic system has been shipped 
customers use assps when they need specific fixed functions with little differentiation  for example when implementing certain electronic industry standards 
however  assps have highly targeted functionality  which limits the range of applications they can address 
in contrast to assps  pld flexibility allows customers to define functionality to suit their needs  rather than restrict their system architecture based on assp manufacturer specifications 
furthermore  pld designers can add ip design blocks to execute standardized functions otherwise performed by assps 
these design flexibility advantages historically resulted in a relatively high unit cost for plds 
programmability required a larger die size  which typically translated into a higher per unit cost when compared with asics or assps manufactured using the same process technology 
as a result  unit volume for plds was typically lower than for asics or assps 
in addition to driving higher cost  the larger die area caused by programmable circuitry also had disadvantages in terms of performance and power consumption for plds when compared with asics or assps manufactured using the same process technology 
secular trends favoring plds tipping point economics and silicon convergence while plds carry the burden of extra die area needed for programmability  the die size difference versus asics and assps has decreased in recent years due to the fact that plds are being manufactured on more advanced process technology 
for our most current designs  pld process technology is typically two or three process generations more advanced than competing asic and assp process technology 
as chip manufacturing becomes more advanced  the total cost of chip development increases  reducing the cost advantage of asics and assps 
as a result  some asic and assp suppliers choose to use non leading edge process technology for new designs to reduce costs 
we believe this has brought us to a tipping point with respect to our opportunity to displace asics and assps 
it is no longer technologically feasible for asic and assp suppliers to continue to use old process generations for technically advanced systems  and  at the same time  it is not economically feasible for them to use new generations of technology for low and mid range volume applications 
the process technology gap between plds and asic and assp alternatives will increase over time and  when combined with the traditional pld advantages of greater flexibility  lower development cost and faster time to market  should drive the accelerated adoption of plds in the years ahead 
in order to compete effectively in their end markets  developers of electronic systems continuously seek ways to improve system performance  lower power consumption and reduce system cost 
as a result  system engineers evaluate different semiconductor alternatives in order to find the optimum solution for each sub system  which must then be interconnected with all other sub systems while remaining in compliance with the technical and commercial specifications of the overall system 
in reaction to the needs of system developers  state of the art semiconductor design has moved increasingly toward silicon convergence  or the combination of multiple semiconductor types including processors  analog devices  and memories  into a single device 
silicon convergence allows for a reduction in the number of devices in a single system  the delay caused by chip to chip connectivity  and in the amount of i o switching power consumed 
silicon convergence is facilitated through the licensing of standard architectures for microprocessors and memories 
once licensed  the microprocessors and memory cores may be combined with additional circuitry and custom logic into a single integrated circuit 
we believe that innovations in pld architecture and pld development tools have also contributed to the increasing use of plds over asics and assps 
newer pld capabilities  such as high speed transceivers  programmable power technology  embedded dsp and embedded microprocessors are helping plds become more silicon convergence friendly  thereby allowing electronics engineers to use plds to meet increasingly complex system requirements for performance  power consumption and cost 
furthermore  licensed ip cores for microprocessors and memory are commercially available but licensed cores for plds are not available 
as a result  with the increasing trend towards silicon convergence  the impact of tipping point economics and the ever increasing need for programmability within an electronic system  we believe that customers will increasingly turn to pld suppliers for not only logic functionality  but also for system integration  in both prototyping and production quantities 
strategy and competition our greatest growth opportunity is in the displacement of asics and assps in the development of next generation electronic systems 
we believe that the fundamental benefits of programmability  combined with the secular trends related to semiconductor economics and the tipping point  and the movement toward silicon convergence  favors the use of plds over alternative semiconductors including asics and assps 
our strategy in recent years has not only been to add more prototyping customers  but more importantly  to use cost optimized products to increase our penetration into higher volume applications and end markets 
pld vendors have innovated and used the most advanced process technology to rapidly reduce pld cost structure and power consumption while increasing device speed and density 
this makes programmable logic an increasingly competitive alternative to asics and assps and will likely increase the use of plds 
in addition  the ability to quickly and efficiently integrate system level ip within a pld not only provides advantages relative to asics and assps  but it also allows the displacement of other semiconductor products  including embedded processors  digital signal processors and microcontrollers 
to capture a larger share of the chips purchased by our customers  we focus on providing the most advanced programmable solutions plds with tailored architectures to provide the speed  density  low power consumption  functionality and package types to meet customer needs plds optimized for low cost and high volume applications hardcopy asics to enable our customers to move easily from our largest plds to a low cost asic optimized  pre verified system level ip cores to speed the design process state of the art development tools that offer low cost  ease of use  and compatibility with other industry standard electronic design automation eda tools a complete customer support system not only do we compete with other pld vendors such as lattice semiconductor corporation  microsemi corporation  and xilinx inc  but we may also encounter a variety of other semiconductor vendors during a given customer engagement 
semiconductor companies with whom we may compete include analog devices inc  applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom corporation  freescale semiconductor inc  intel corporation  lsi corporation  marvell technology group  ltd  microchip technology inc  nec corporation  nvidia corporation  pmc sierra inc  st microelectronics  texas instruments inc  toshiba semiconductor company and vitesse semiconductor corporation 
within the pld market  there are two distinct sub segments  cplds and fpgas  which comprise the majority of revenues but  due to product differences  usually do not compete directly for the same customer designs 
the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market over the last several years 
fpgas now account for approximately of total pld sales and are expected to continue to be the fastest growing segment of the pld market 
based on our estimates  we believe that our share of the fpga market increased from in to in  and that maintaining or increasing our fpga market share is important to our long term growth 
competition is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in their systems 
because each vendor s products are proprietary  drop in replacement devices are not available and the cost of switching to a different vendor s products after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  customers rarely switch vendors after the initial selection for a particular design 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before the customer starts volume purchases of selected devices 
the selection may take place relatively early in the design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sample the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications and manufacture in volume 
as a result  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage and experiencing a shift in pld market share  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because the end markets are highly fragmented we have over  customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their competitive strength based on winning designs at a particular point in time 
the principal competitive factors in the pld market include technical innovation device performance  power consumption  and features capability and productivity of software development tools and ip cores pricing and availability quality and reliability technical service and customer support manufacturing and operational competence customer familiarity with existing vendors and entrenched products we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our proprietary and tailored device architectures and installed base of software development systems provides additional competitive advantage 
due to unique architectural innovation and advanced technologies  our new product families provide greater functionality and lower power consumption at a lower price for any given logic density compared with their predecessors 
newer product features such as multi gigabit transceivers and variable precision dsp blocks have enhanced our design win rate relative to other pld vendors 
we also believe that our new product families are more silicon convergence friendly and offer capabilities that allow us to compete more favorably against asics and assps  as well as against other types of chips such as microcontrollers  microprocessors  and digital signal processors 
designers can add some of the functionality of these other chips to plds using pre built and pre verified ip cores 
an ip core is typically offered in either a hard or soft form 
altera  at the time of chip development for our plds  can embed a hard ip core into the actual circuitry of the pld 
a soft ip core is a licensed design file that our customers incorporate into their design and program onto the pld 
by incorporating more functionality and logic capacity on a programmable chip while providing the necessary design tools and ip cores to design a reliable system  we believe we can enhance the advantages of plds over competing solutions 
as is true of the semiconductor industry as a whole  the digital logic segment and the pld sub segment are intensely competitive  and each successive product generation is characterized by rapid technological change and price decline 
all of these factors may adversely affect our future operating results 
products our products consist primarily of devices  ip cores and proprietary development tools 
a brief overview of these products follows 
devices our devices fall into the following four categories  spanning multiple architectures and families with numerous product options fpgas cplds hardcopy asics configuration devices that store the programming code for our fpgas our percentage of net sales by product category is as follows product fpgas cplds other products including hardcopy asics  configuration devices  ip cores  and development tools each device family has unique functional benefits and different density and performance specifications 
some of our latest device families  typically designed into new equipment  are summarized and described below 
stratix series high end  system level fpgas our stratix product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and address a broad range of applications requiring system integration across all our markets 
programmable power technology in stratix fpgas helps provide high performance and low total power consumption 
embedded hardcopy blocks within our stratix v fpga architecture enable altera to quickly create application targeted devices by efficient hardening of standard or logic intensive functions  providing further improvements in speed and lower power consumption while offering flexible embedded system functionality 
additionally  our stratix v gx and stratix v gt fpgas offer advanced transceiver capabilities for applications that require reliable  multi gigabit serial data transfer rates of up to gbps 
our stratix v gs fpgas are optimized for applications requiring high performance  variable precision dsp 
arria series mid range  transceiver and embedded processor equipped fpgas our arria product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and enable a simplified transceiver based design for applications requiring high performance data transfer protocols 
arria v gx fpgas offer best in class signal integrity with data transfer rates of up to gbps  providing designers a high quality and reliable solution for next generation high bandwidth systems across all our markets 
in addition  our arria v soc fpgas integrate an arm based hard processor system consisting of processor  peripherals  and memory interfaces with the fpga fabric using a high bandwidth interconnect backbone 
it combines the performance and power savings of hard intellectual property with the flexibility of programmable logic 
cyclone series low cost  transceiver and embedded processor equipped fpgas our cyclone product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and bring programmable flexibility to cost sensitive applications in all our markets 
our cyclone iv and cyclone v fpgas use low power process technology to meet market requirements for low power consumption 
additionally  our cyclone v gx fpgas incorporate up to integrated transceivers with data rates up to gbps 
architectural innovation allows cyclone fpgas to combine a low cost structure with abundant device resources  making them ideal for high volume applications 
our cyclone v soc fpgas integrate an arm based hard processor system consisting of processor  peripherals  and memory interfaces with the fpga fabric using a high bandwidth interconnect backbone 
it combines the performance and power savings of hard intellectual property with the flexibility of programmable logic 
initial shipments of our cyclone v fpgas are planned in max series cplds our max families are instant on  non volatile cplds that are used in general purpose and portable designs for a broad range of electronics equipment 
our max v cplds have a revolutionary architecture that significantly reduces total power consumption when compared with competing cplds 
for the most demanding low power and battery operated portable applications  our max v cplds offer microamp standby current in ultra small chip packaging 
hardcopy asics our hardcopy asics offer customers a migration path from high density fpga families to a low cost asic for high volume production 
for a given process technology  hardcopy asics deliver nearly the performance of comparable cell based asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
in contrast to traditional cell based asics  in which every mask layer is custom and unique to the customer s design  our hardcopy asics share a common set of base layers so only the last few mask layers are customized to implement the customer s design 
by removing the configuration circuitry  programmable routing  and programmability for logic and memory  we reduce the die size and therefore device cost  but deliver functionality  performance and power characteristics that are equivalent to or more favorable than that of an fpga 
as a result  customers get the flexibility and time to market advantages of a high density fpga during the prototyping and early production phases  and then convert the design to a hardcopy asic for high volume production 
this allows hardcopy asics to be used in high volume cost sensitive applications historically served by traditional cell based asics 
intellectual property cores ip cores are pre verified building blocks that execute system level functions 
by incorporating more functionality and logic capacity on a programmable chip while providing the necessary design tools and ip cores to design a reliable system  we believe we can enhance the advantages of plds over competing solutions 
an ip core is typically offered in either a hard or soft form 
a hard ip core is embedded into the actual circuitry of our chips  which yields a small die area and typically provides advantages in cost  performance  and power consumption 
our recent fpga product generations have introduced hard ip cores such as variable precision dsp blocks  multi gigabit transceivers  embedded processor cores and a variety of interface protocols 
a soft ip core is a licensed design file that our customers incorporate into their design and program onto the pld 
customers integrate ip cores in their pld designs with our proprietary development software 
soft ip cores available for use in our devices include our nios series of embedded processors  our portfolio of megacore functions that we license to our customers  and our altera megafunction partners program ampp sm cores  which are pre verified by us and licensed to our customers by third parties 
the nios series of embedded processors uses a reduced instruction set computing risc architecture and can be efficiently used in our fpgas and hardcopy asic devices as a cost competitive and flexible alternative to discrete microcontroller solutions 
the nios series of embedded processors compete favorably with many discrete microcontrollers 
other embedded processor ip cores  both hard and soft implementations  are also offered and supported by altera through partnership agreements with companies including arm ltd 
and mips technologies 
with ip cores  system designers can focus more time and energy on improving and differentiating the unique aspects of their system designs  rather than spending time designing common off the shelf functions 
ip cores are essential to providing solutions with higher levels of integration and faster time to market 
today  we offer a broad range of soft ip cores for dsp algorithms  bus interfaces  memory controllers  telecommunications  data communications  microprocessors  and peripherals 
before licensing a soft ip core  customers can download an encrypted soft ip core from our website and verify that it works in their own system designs 
while licensing soft ip cores represents a small portion of our net sales  we believe a broad product offering in this area is necessary to compete with asic and assp vendors as well as other pld vendors 
development tools to enhance engineering productivity  customers use our proprietary development tools  consisting primarily of the quartus ii software  for design entry  design compilation  design verification  and device programming 
designers can use our development tools on a variety of computing platforms  including microsoft windows  unix including solaris and hp ux  and linux operating environments  with built in interfaces to industry standard eda tools offered by cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation  synopsys  inc and others 
like ip cores  our development tools generate less than of our net sales  but are a critical and necessary element of our product portfolio because they are used to program our devices and can drive our success in competing for design wins against pld  asic and assp vendors 
research and development our research and development activities focus primarily on plds  hardcopy asics  ip cores  development software and hardware 
we develop these related products in parallel to provide comprehensive design support to customers 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we introduced a number of new families in recent years  including the stratix v including e  gx  gs and gt  stratix iv including e  gx and gt  stratix iii  cyclone v including e  gx  gt and soc  cyclone iv including e and gx  cyclone iii  arria v including e  gx  gt and soc  arria ii gx  max v  max ii  hardcopy iv and hardcopy iii device families  as well as major enhancements to our ip core offerings and the quartus ii development platform 
our research and development costs  which are charged to expense as incurred  were million in  million in and million in patents  trademarks  and licenses we rely on intellectual property laws  including patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws  to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in products and technology 
activities include patents as of december   we owned more than  united states and foreign patents 
we also had more than  patent applications pending worldwide 
trademarks we use  register and apply to register certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign countries 
product registrations we file registrations in the united states under the semiconductor chip protection act to protect our chip designs 
when appropriate  we file lawsuits to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have also licensed technology that allows us to design  manufacture and sell products using certain intellectual property owned by others 
marketing and sales we market our products worldwide through a network of distributors  independent sales representatives and direct sales personnel 
altera distributors in all of the major geographic markets that we serve  we work with distributors to provide demand creation for the broad customer base and order fulfillment services for most of our customers 
these distributors are franchised by component manufacturers to sell a wide variety of products to many customers  and they may sell competing products or solutions 
we have contracts with our distributors that can be terminated by either party upon notice 
all of our distributors stock inventory of our products 
distributors purchase products from us at a set distributor cost denominated in us dollars 
title and risk of loss transfer upon shipment from our stocking locations  which are located in the asia pacific region at the independent subcontractors that we employ for test and assembly services or at our warehouse in san jose 
when products are shipped to a distributor  we defer revenue on the sale until the distributor sells the products in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
consequently  the deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded as a current liability under the caption deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
all payments to us are denominated in us dollars 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy  see note significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our consolidated financial statements 
our sales cycle begins with a design win phase  which can be lengthy  is uncertain and often requires the ongoing participation of sales  engineering and managerial personnel 
once customer demand has been created and a design is ready to move to prototyping or production  the order fulfillment process begins 
customer orders are primarily processed and fulfilled by a local distributor 
for these orders  our distributors are the legal sellers of the products and therefore bear all risks related to the ownership and sale of the products  including credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft and foreign currency fluctuations 
for certain arrangements  altera drop ships products to fulfill orders processed through our primary distributor 
our distributors periodically return certain amounts of unsold product and receive price concessions for unsold product if we reduce prices 
for high volume or competitive situations  we often provide price concessions to our distributors 
a customer purchasing a small quantity of product from a distributor usually pays list price 
however  a customer using our products in volume production  purchasing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of units  will often negotiate a substantial price discount from the distributor 
under these circumstances  the distributor will often negotiate and receive a price concession from altera 
these price concessions are negotiated in us dollars 
average aggregate price concessions typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing of shipments to distributors or payment of price concessions 
this is a standard practice in the semiconductor industry  and we generally provide some level of price concession to every distributor 
our net sales are the sum of our own direct sales to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  plus our distributors resale of altera products 
for  and  worldwide sales through distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers accounted for  and respectively  of our net sales 
arrow electronics  inc including its affiliates arrow  our largest distributor  accounted for of our net sales in  in and in our second largest distributor  macnica  inc including its affiliates macnica  accounted for of our net sales in  in and in no other distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in  or altera sales  marketing  and customer support altera has a dedicated global sales and marketing organization to create customer demand and manage our network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts  and provide technical  business and marketing support to distributors and independent sales representatives 
independent sales representatives  who are mostly located in north america and in select european countries  create demand and provide customer support in a defined territory and often with a defined set of customers 
they do not stock inventory or fulfill orders 
all of our contracts with independent sales representatives can be terminated by either party upon notice 
customer support and service are important to selling and marketing our products 
we provide several levels of technical support  including application assistance  design services  and customer training 
we also publish data sheets and application notes  conduct technical seminars and provide design assistance to customers via the internet and electronic links 
we have domestic sales offices in numerous major metropolitan areas throughout the united states  and we maintain international sales support offices in bangalore  beijing  cork  chengdu  helsinki  hong kong  london  munich  osaka  ottawa  paris  seoul  shanghai  shenzhen  singapore  stockholm  taipei  tokyo  toronto and turin

backlog our backlog consists of distributor orders  as well as certain oem orders  that are for delivery within the next three months 
our backlog of orders as of december  was approximately billion  compared with billion as of december  historically  backlog is a poor predictor of future sales or customer demand for the following reasons while our backlog increases during periods of high demand and supply constraints  purchasers may  in most cases  cancel product orders up to days before the scheduled delivery date without incurring significant cancellation penalties 
our backlog is valued at list price  which in most cases is substantially higher than the price ultimately recognized as revenue 
manufacturing wafer supply die  cut from silicon wafers  are the essential components of all our devices and comprise a significant portion of the total device cost 
our manufacturing strategy is known as a fabless business model since we purchase our silicon wafers from independent semiconductor foundries instead of manufacturing them ourselves 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of these suppliers economies of scale and gives us direct and timely access to advanced process technology 
we purchase our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an independent semiconductor foundry 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from tsmc 
in the past  we have used other foundry vendors  and we may establish additional foundry relationships as they become economically beneficial or technically necessary 
testing and assembly after wafer manufacturing is completed  each silicon wafer is tested using a variety of test and handling equipment that is owned by us and consigned to our partners 
the vast majority of our silicon wafer testing is performed at tsmc 
the wafers are then shipped to various assembly suppliers in asia  where they are sorted into good die and encapsulated in packages 
we use a number of independent assembly suppliers to take advantage of their economies of scale and supply flexibility  and to give us direct and timely access to advanced packaging technology 
we purchase almost all of our assembly services from amkor electronics  inc amkor in korea and the philippines  and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc ase in malaysia and taiwan 
following assembly  each packaged unit completes final testing  marking and inspection before being packaged for storage as finished goods 
we also use amkor and ase for almost all of our final test and back end operation services 
these partners perform final testing using our proprietary test software operating on hardware that is consigned to or owned by our suppliers 
the majority of our inventory  including finished goods  is warehoused in asia at our subcontract test and assembly partners 
these suppliers also ship our products to oems and distributors

item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors  among others that are not presently known or that we currently believe unimportant  could affect our future results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider these risks  in addition to the other information contained in this report 
our business  financial condition  and operations results could be seriously harmed if any of the events described here actually occurs 
in that situation  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies  such as altera  experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry has experienced economic downturns and business contractions from time to time  which can be severe and prolonged 
the fluctuations follow the turns of the global economy and in a downturn can result in significant reductions in product demand and excess customer inventories 
global economic weakness or cyclical downturns have previously resulted from periods of economic recession  reduced access to credit markets  weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies  weak end user demand  excess industry capacity or general reductions in inventory levels by customers 
it is difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities in today s global economy 
our ability to predict the quantity and type of products our customers will need in the future is challenging because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
these factors could affect the timing of customer orders and the overall level of demand for our products 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer s product  and because our end markets are highly fragmented we have over  pld customers  our ability to forecast end customer demand is difficult 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell as quickly as estimated  if at all 
as a result we could hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our customers business and their ability to access financing  which could adversely affect demand for our products 
our operating cash flows are highly dependent on the continued collection of receivables and our ability to sell our products 
declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of our receivables 
in addition to reductions in sales and elevated risk associated with the collection of receivables  our profitability and cash flows may suffer during downturns because we may not be able to reduce costs at the same rate as our sales decline 
as further described below  we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers and to assemble  test and ship our semiconductor products 
uncertainties in the capital and credit market  however  may adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations 
if our subcontractors capital structures weaken  they may fail to satisfy our demand and our business could be materially disrupted 
if global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  we could experience a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate due to many factors  including vertical market pricing mix changes in the mix of our prototyping and production based business competitive pricing dynamics and customer mix various manufacturing cost variables including product yields  wafer prices  package and assembly costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and absorption of manufacturing overhead the majority of our sales are typically booked and shipped within the same quarter and forecasting our gross margins is difficult 
our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects 
the semiconductor industry  including the pld market  is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry depends on our ability to provide our customers with solutions providing greater value than those offered by competing programmable logic vendors  such as xilinx and lattice  and other semiconductor companies that indirectly compete with us 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by asic  assp  fpga  cpld  dsp  and microprocessor microcontroller vendors  we compete against these vendors 
to the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
other competitors include manufacturers of high density programmable logic products characterized by fpga type architectures high volume and low cost fpgas as programmable replacements for asics and assps asics and assps with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic high speed  low density cplds high performance dsp devices products with embedded multi gigabit transceivers other new or emerging programmable logic products many of these competitors have substantially more financial  technical and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may be unable to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell pld products 
the benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment 
we recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies  and we are developing architectures  processes and products to meet these varying customer needs 
recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions  we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our ic products 
we believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment 
the highly competitive environment of the semiconductor industry and the high costs associated with manufacturing technologies and developing marketable products have resulted in significant consolidation in the industry and are likely to lead to further consolidation 
we may pursue business combination opportunities to improve our market share and the applications and products we can market 
however  we may be outbid for the best assets 
we also may become a target for a company looking to improve its competitive position 
such an occurrence may take place at any time with consequences that may not be predictable and that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
approximately of our net sales for was derived from customers participating in the telecom and wireless vertical market 
in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
any deterioration in the communications end market or reduction in capital spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the length of our design in and sales cycles could affect our ability to forecast future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into end customers products  and on those products being produced in volume 
our products are very complex  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from six months to three years or more 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors can affect the timing and or volume of our sales 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our end customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  end customer program delays and cancellations and our ability to ship products according to customer schedules 
our business is characterized by a general decline in semiconductor product selling prices that may materially and adversely affect our profitability 
the selling prices of our products have decreased over time 
we have offset the selling price decreases by reducing manufacturing costs  improving yields and increasing unit sales 
however  our ongoing efforts may not be successful or may not keep pace with the anticipated  continued decline in product selling prices  which could ultimately reduce revenues and gross margins 
because we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non us laws  regulations and customs 
during  sales outside of the us and canada constituted approximately of our net sales  and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political and social conditions in a specific country or region fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates adverse changes in tax laws increased freight costs interruptions in air transportation reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries longer receivable collection periods natural or man made disasters in the countries or regions where we sell our products different labor regulations we must comply with a variety of foreign laws and we experience risks associated with legislation and regulations for importing and exporting semiconductor products 
in the future  the united states or other countries may impose quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes or other charges  restrictions or trade barriers for the import or export of our products 
we rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders 
the failure of our distributors to perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for of our net sales during we rely on many distributors to help us create end customer demand  provide technical support and other value added services to end customers  fill customer orders and stock our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets and higher interest rates could potentially affect our distributors operations 
we are highly dependent on certain distributors  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow electronics  inc and affiliates arrow  accounted for approximately of net sales on a worldwide basis  while our next largest distributor  macnica  inc and its affiliates macnica  accounted for approximately of net sales 
as of december   accounts receivable from arrow and macnica individually accounted for and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable 
our ability to add or replace distributors is limited 
we contract with distributors to perform two primary  yet distinct  functions that are difficult to replace distributors provide logistics support  such as order entry  credit  forecasting  inventory management and shipment of product  to end customers 
the process of integrating systems to allow for electronic data interchange is complex and can be time consuming 
distributors create demand for our products at the engineering level 
this mandates the training of an extended distributor sales force  as well as hiring and training specialized applications engineers skilled in promoting and servicing products at the engineering level 
in addition  our distributors expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels may not be easily transferable to a new distributor 
end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor 
we depend entirely on tsmc to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
tsmc s failure to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
our silicon wafers are produced by tsmc in its manufacturing facilities located primarily in taiwan and the us silicon wafer production facilities have a fixed capacity that is allocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from tsmc 
our operations would be disrupted if tsmc ended its relationship with us and we were unable to arrange a satisfactory and cost effective alternative to quickly fulfill customer orders 
to ensure continued wafer supply  we may establish other wafer supply sources as these arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  only a few foundry vendors have the capability to manufacture our most advanced products 
if we engage alternative supply sources  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
in addition  shipments could be significantly delayed while these sources are qualified for volume production 
furthermore  because we rely on a third party foundry vendor  we have little or no direct control over production costs  delivery schedules and wafer quality 
we also face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
wafer shortages and or increased wafer and assembly material costs could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales or otherwise materially disrupt our business 
if market demand for silicon wafers or assembly material suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited 
a shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
product manufacturing is complex  and we may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires 
manufacturing our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
we depend not only on sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  but also on good production yields the number of good die per wafer and timely wafer delivery to meet customer demand and maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as a result  we may experience problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendor 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin new product production  when we transition to new processes or when our wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
as a result of manufacturing defects  tsmc has also occasionally scrapped wafers  resulting in longer manufacturing lead times 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer supplier  and we may occasionally experience production delays 
these difficulties and delays can potentially cause significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble  test and ship our semiconductor products 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble  test and ship our semiconductor products and to provide package piece parts  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
we depend on sufficient subcontractor assembly and test capacities  both in raw materials and services  to meet the demand for our products 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
if market demand for subcontractor material and services exceeds available supply or if the subcontractors capital structures weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems and or increased manufacturing costs 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
the economic  market  social and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable and could have a significant impact on our business if we were unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war and labor disruption  natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariffs  import or export quotas  power and water shortages or interruption in air transportation in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
our failure to define  develop and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
our products are manufactured using a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may impact the timely introduction of competitive new products or product enhancements 
additionally  we may not be successful in developing new products or using and converting established products to new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our current generation product families  including the stratix v including e  gx  gs and gt family  are manufactured on a nanometer process technology  but our next generation product families will be manufactured on smaller circuit geometries that we have not used before 
the use of advanced process technology has technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect research and development spending  yields  product costs and product delivery timeliness 
we rely on information technology systems failure of these systems to function properly  or unauthorized access to our systems  could result in significant business disruption 
we rely on information technology it systems to manage our business 
we evaluate our business processes and our it systems on an ongoing basis and make periodic enhancements to our business processes and the functionality of our it systems 
in connection with these enhancements  we modify our processes and controls to ensure continued reliability and integrity of our business processes and related it systems 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced processes  systems or controls  could adversely affect our ability to generate accurate financial and management information in a timely manner 
these systems are also susceptible to power and telecommunication disruptions and other system failures 
failure of our it systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption 
we also may face the risk of unauthorized access to our it systems through a security breach or attack 
we strive to identify and investigate any such security incidents and prevent their recurrence 
however  in certain cases  there may be undetected incidents or the impact of identified incidents may not be fully understood 
our business could be significantly disrupted and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of a significant security breach 
any prolonged disruption to our global communications infrastructure could impair our ability to plan production activity and respond to customer demand 
demand for our products is highly volatile  especially at the detailed ordering code level 
to achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service while maintaining low levels of inventory  we constantly adjust our manufacturing subcontractors production schedules 
we develop and adjust these schedules based on end customer demand as communicated by our distributors and based on our inventory levels  manufacturing cycle times  component lead times  and projected production yields 
we combine and distribute all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network 
our ability to estimate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network  we have no manual back up 
a prolonged disruption or service failure in a portion of this network would impair our ability to plan production activity and respond to demand 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and net income 
we produce highly complex hardware and software products that incorporate leading edge technology 
our pre shipment testing programs may not detect all defects 
because our product warranties against materials and workmanship defects and non conformance to our specifications are for varying lengths of time  we have occasionally been required to replace components or refund the purchase price paid due to product defects 
if the costs for customer or warranty claims increase significantly compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins and net income may be adversely affected 
for example  if we cannot fix a product defect in a timely manner  we may incur product reengineering expenses  increased inventory costs or damage to our reputation  any of which could materially affect our revenue  gross margins and net income 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
our devices are used in automotive  military  aerospace  avionics  medical equipment and other systems where system failure could cause damage to property or people 
we may receive product liability claims if our devices cause system failures 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low  but could be higher if either the sales volume in these applications or the frequency of system failures caused by our devices increases 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters in san jose  california is located near major earthquake faults 
some of our international facilities and those of our key suppliers  including tsmc  which produces our silicon wafers  are also located near major earthquake faults 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could make it difficult for altera and our independent subcontractors to meet product design deadlines  maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 
any catastrophic event could also affect our customers or potential customers which could reduce or delay orders and ultimately decrease our revenue 
as we carry only limited insurance coverage  any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents  and we do not have coverage for certain losses 
we believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice and economic and availability considerations 
if our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses  any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
legislative action could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate 
legislative action may be taken by the us congress which  if ultimately enacted  would adversely affect our effective tax rate and or require us to take further action  at potentially significant expense  to seek to preserve our effective tax rate 
the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that  if adopted  could substantially modify the rules governing the us taxation of certain us affiliates 
the potential changes include  but are not limited to  curbing the deferral of us taxation of certain foreign earnings and limiting the ability to use foreign tax credits 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 
however  any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be because of  among other things  uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate  including jurisdictions outside the us as a result  our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations and that variance may be material 
the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and mask work laws to protect our intellectual property  proprietary information and technology rights 
as of december   we owned more than  us patents and foreign patents  and had more than  patents applications pending worldwide 
our patents and patent applications may not protect us from our competition  which may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our products 
in addition  other parties  including our former employees or consultants  may try to disclose  obtain or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization despite our best efforts at prevention 
if other companies obtain this information or develop similar information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against ours 
moreover  the laws of certain countries where we sell  manufacture or distribute products may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
if others use our proprietary rights  it could materially harm our business and require expensive litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
we occasionally receive inquiries about possible patent infringements that may require us to obtain licenses relating to our current or future products 
we may be unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  or the license agreements may have set durations or may not provide complete protection against infringement claims involving all of our current or future products 
if we are sued for patent infringement  the costs and outcome of litigation will be unpredictable and may have a negative impact on our financial results 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings are also unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
if our defense against intellectual property infringement claims is unsuccessful  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
alternatively  we could be required to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  the success of which may be uncertain 
intellectual property litigation may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

item legal proceedings 
we were named as a party to a lawsuit concerning our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting 
in may and july  we were notified that three shareholder derivative lawsuits had been filed in the superior court of the state of california  county of santa clara  by persons identifying themselves as altera shareholders and purporting to act on behalf of altera  naming altera corporation as a nominal defendant and naming some of our current and former officers and directors as defendants 
on july   one of these derivative actions was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff shareholder 
the remaining two derivative lawsuits pending in santa clara superior court were consolidated into a single action on september  plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint on december  on january   altera and the defendants filed a motion to stay this action pending resolution of the federal derivative action discussed below 
on february   one of the remaining derivative plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed his derivative claims and  on march   the other remaining derivative plaintiff filed a third amended complaint 
in june  altera and the defendants demurred to the third amended complaint 
after the court issued a tentative ruling in favor of altera  the parties agreed to stay the action in order to allow plaintiff to serve a demand on altera s board of directors 
the plaintiff served the demand on november  in the first quarter of  the board of directors completed its review of the demand and decided to reject plantiff s demand 
on june   the plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint  alleging that the board of director s decision to reject plaintiff s demand was wrongful 
on july   altera demurred to the fourth amended complaint 
in october  the court dismissed plaintiff s fourth amended complaint and granted plaintiff leave to file a fifth amended complaint 
on november   the plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint  alleging that altera s board of directors wrongfully refused his demand 
on december   altera  joined by the individual defendants  demurred to the fifth amended complaint 
on march   the plaintiff entered into a stipulation agreeing to voluntarily dismiss the action with prejudice 
on april   the court entered an order dismissing the action with prejudice and set a dismissal review hearing for june  the april order dismissing the action with prejudice was finalized at the june dismissal review hearing 
plaintiff asserted claims against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment  violations of california corporation code section  breach of fiduciary duty for insider selling and misappropriation of information  and deceit 
plaintiff s claims concerned the granting of stock options by altera between and and the alleged filing of false and misleading financial statements between and all of these claims were asserted derivatively on behalf of altera 
plaintiff sought  among other relief  an indeterminate amount of damages from the individual defendants and a judgment directing altera to reform its corporate governance practices 
during the months of may  june  and july  four other derivative lawsuits were filed by purported altera shareholders  on behalf of altera  in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
on august   these actions were consolidated  and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on november  on september   the plaintiffs voluntarily agreed to dismiss the case 
on september   the court entered an order dismissing the case 
on december   intellectual ventures i llc and intellectual ventures ii llc intellectual ventures filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against altera  microsemi corporation  and lattice semiconductor corporation alleging that altera is infringing five patents 
the complaint requests unspecified monetary damages including enhanced damages for willful infringement 
in february  intellectual ventures filed a first amended complaint adding xilinx  inc as a defendant 
in march  altera answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims against intellectual ventures for non infringement and invalidity of the asserted patents 
the defendants filed motions in the district of delaware to transfer the case to the united states district court for the northern district of california and to stay the action pending re examination proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office 
intellectual ventures opposed the motions 
in january  the united states district court for the district of delaware denied the defendants motion to transfer the case to the northern district of california  and on february   the court denied the defendants motion to stay 
because the case is at a very early stage  it is not possible for us to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred nor can we estimate the range of potential loss 
on june   altera filed an action in the united states district court for the northern district of california against lsi corporation and agere systems  inc collectively lsi 
the action alleges that lsi infringes various patents owned by altera and also seeks a declaratory judgment that altera does not infringe various patents owned by lsi and or agere the lsi patents and that the lsi patents are invalid 
in september  lsi answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims of patent infringement against altera 
in november  the parties entered into a settlement and patent license agreement  dismissing all claims against each other

executive overview company and market overview we are a global semiconductor company  serving over  customers within the telecom and wireless  industrial automation  military and automotive  networking  computer and storage  and other vertical markets 
the other vertical market includes sub markets of broadcast  consumer  medical and test 
we design  manufacture  and market a variety of products programmable logic devices plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds  are standard semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that our customers program to perform desired logic functions in their electronic systems 
hardcopy application specific integrated circuit asic devices transition customer designs from high density fpgas to low cost non programmable devices for volume production 
pre defined design building blocks  known as intellectual property ip cores  can be licensed by customers to easily implement standard functions in their pld designs 
proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations  is used by customers to develop  compile  and verify their designs  and then program their designs into our plds 
in  sales of plds generated of our net sales  with fpga and cpld sales comprising approximately and of our net sales  respectively 
the remainder of our net sales is comprised of our hardcopy devices and configuration devices used in conjunction with our fpgas  as well as licensing of ip cores and proprietary development tools 
market opportunity based on publicly available data and information derived from gartner dataquest  an independent research firm  we estimate that the pld market was approximately billion in we also estimate that the combined asic and assp market in was approximately billion  comprised of the asic market at approximately billion and the assp market at approximately billion 
due to the low priced nature of some very high volume asic and assp applications  including mobile phones and certain consumer applications such as pc related equipment  video games and portable media applications  we do not believe that the entire asic and assp market is available for displacement by plds 
as such  we estimate that the pld accessible asic and assp market was approximately billion in billion in accessible asics and billion in accessible assps and that this represents significant pld growth potential 
in addition to the accessible portion of the asic and assp market of billion in  we believe our embedded initiative offers an additional available market of approximately billion 
by investing in and developing software  hard and soft ip  and licensed cores for microprocessors and memory  as well as application targeted fpgas  we believe that we can capture a higher percentage of the semiconductor bill of materials in an embedded system 
with the increasing tendency towards silicon convergence  the impact of tipping point economics  and the ever increasing need for programmability within an electronic system  we believe that customers will increasingly turn to pld suppliers for not only logic functionality  but also system integration in both prototyping and production quantities 
with a combined billion asic  assp and embedded market replacement opportunity  our goal is that  over time  the average growth rate of our revenue can double that of the total semiconductor industry 
while we have had some degree of success winning customer designs over asics  assps  embedded processors and microcontrollers  the rate at which customers will adopt the use of plds is unclear 
technological issues  including those related to power consumption  performance specifications and design methodology  may inhibit some customers from the broad adoption of plds 
despite having success in winning new designs and a higher growth rate of plds relative to asics  assps  embedded processors and microcontrollers in recent years  our share gains relative to these alternatives may take many years to become significant due to the small size of the pld market when compared to the combined accessible revenue of asics  assps  embedded processors and microcontrollers 
this is compounded by the fact that it may take a long period of time for revenue from new designs to become meaningful when compared with the existing legacy revenue stream 
driving operational excellence since the pld market emerged in the s  the financial business models of the leading pld suppliers have generally been favorable when compared to most other semiconductor companies 
fabless strategies  high barriers to entry  and proprietary architectures have contributed to strong financial results for pld suppliers 
we regularly engage in a strategic review of our business to improve operations and financial returns 
we are focused on maximizing return on invested capital by pursuing greater efficiencies in all aspects of our operations while seeking balance with our commitment to continued investment in advanced technology for the development of new products 
in recent years  we have increased our focus on enhancing our business model by simplifying our business processes while also growing pld market share 
our ability to maintain investment in the research and development of future products  has been aided by our early and ongoing cost savings initiatives  and is a vital factor for our future sales and earnings growth 
in addition  our prior work in analyzing business processes has not only allowed us to effectively identify and implement simplification and cost reduction initiatives  but the concept of workflow efficiency has become a valued aspect of our business culture 
leveraging our global structure we believe that we have opportunities to further expand our position outside of the us our organization and management structure integrates our us and us operations and provides our management team with a global perspective on our markets 
we believe that this infrastructure provides opportunities to develop and commercialize new products that meet global needs and can be rapidly launched in multiple markets 
our global organizational focus should allow us to continue to grow outside of the us faster than within the us competing for design wins we compete with other pld vendors to displace other semiconductor alternatives and for market share within the pld market 
competition between pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design  when customers select products for use in the customer s electronic system 
customers often prefer to use the same pld vendor in successive product generations 
this incumbency advantage is driven by a customer s investment in building expertise with the pld vendor s software and the re use of portions of a design from prior generations 
in addition  because each pld vendor s products are proprietary  the cost to switch plds after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  a design win can provide the pld vendor with a profitable revenue stream through the life of the customer s program 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be two or more years before a customer starts volume production of its system 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in a customer s design process  but it may take several years to complete system design  build prototypes  sample the marketplace for customer acceptance  make modifications and manufacture in volume 
thus  there is a delay between developing a competitive advantage and experiencing a shift in the pld market  meaning that market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success and timing of customer programs  and because the end markets are highly fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their own competitive strength in winning designs at a particular point in time 
developing competitive products a pld vendor s ability to secure design wins and to maintain or increase market share is highly dependent on the cost and quality of its products  its ability to provide tailored architectures  and the effectiveness and reliability of its proprietary development software 
development software  working in tandem with device logic architecture and features  creates the functionality desired by the customer 
we develop our software in parallel with our devices  and there are schedule and integration risks between the two processes 
if we fail to create adequate software to support our new devices as they are introduced  we weaken our competitive position  which can have long lasting effects if customers switch to competing solutions and become less familiar and less skilled with our software 
we focus the majority of our research and development resources on next generation fpgas that are silicon convergence friendly 
increasing our fpga market share and the further success of our tailored architectural approach in our new fpga product families is important to our long term growth and profitability 
due to the higher integration density and lower cost per function  the fpga market has outgrown the cpld market in recent years  and industry participants and observers believe this trend will continue 
since the initial introduction of our stratix and cyclone fpga families in  we have introduced several more fpga families in the stratix  cyclone and arria series of products 
as a result of these product introductions  we estimate  based on publicly available data and with information derived from gartner dataquest  that our market share has increased as follows market share pld fpga cpld complementing our stratix fpgas is our hardcopy family of asics 
the availability of a hardcopy conversion path for high density fpga designs is a competitive advantage 
we first shipped hardcopy devices in  offering customers low cost  non programmable production devices that use our highest density fpgas as an integrated development vehicle 
hardcopy devices are targeted specifically at those applications and customers that have used plds for prototyping and development and traditional cell based asics from other vendors for their volume production needs 
we have improved our cpld offering by introducing the max ii family in  the max iiz family in and the max v family in max v cplds offer pricing and features that we believe are competitively attractive  with cost  performance  power consumption  and density that are superior to our previous offerings 
an fpga family typically reaches peak sales four to five years after initial product shipment 
as a result  the stratix iii and cyclone iii families  introduced in  comprised approximately of our net sales in  and may be at or near peak sales 
we believe that the products we introduced from to have yet to reach peak sales 
to improve or even sustain our growth rate  we must successfully introduce successor generations of devices 
the degree to which other pld vendors improve the competitiveness and execution of their products  including the ability to support silicon convergence  may impair our ability to improve our growth rate 
within the next several quarters  we plan to ship newer fpga families using more advanced production techniques that will further improve product performance and lower cost 
our foundry partner  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  will manufacture these die using production processes that are new to the industry 
given the extreme complexity of semiconductor fabrication  tsmc may encounter difficulties that could delay our product launch or limit supply so that we would be unable to meet customer commitments 
we may discover manufacturing errors after we begin shipping  which could harm customer relations and cause us to incur additional unforeseen costs 
simultaneous introduction of new pld architectures and ramp of new technology processes are inherently risky 
diagnosing failures  identifying root causes  and implementing corrective actions in a production wafer fabrication facility are expensive and time consuming 
we may not successfully commercialize our new products  or our new products may not enable us to maintain or increase market share 
some of our competitive offerings may be offered later than the competition  and it is possible that our competitive offerings will be less effective  thus weakening our market share 
it is also possible that our primary competitor may have secured design wins that  when they enter production  will reverse some of our recent market share gains 
our main competitor is larger in size with more sales and research and development resources  and we may not enjoy the same success that we saw with previous fpga generations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires our management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we sell the majority of our products to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
in most cases  sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns 
we defer recognition of revenue and costs until the products are resold by the distributor 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us with periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that reported data is accurate 
at times  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
this reconciliation process requires us to estimate the amount of in transit shipments net of in transit returns to our distributors 
in transit days can significantly vary among geographies and individual distributors 
we also apply judgment when estimating the total value of price concessions earned by our distributors but not claimed by the end of the reporting period 
this is because there is a time lag between the price concessions earned and claimed by the distributors for any underlying resale of products 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our net sales  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories as necessary 
we establish provisions for inventory for technological obsolescence or if inventory levels on hand are in excess of projected customer demand 
such provisions result in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand 
actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory or a benefit from inventory previously written down 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we generally allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
income taxes we establish a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances  when necessary  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if  in the future  we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap  whereby we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the merits of the position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of us gaap and complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
results of operations results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales were as follows net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development expense selling  general  and administrative expense compensation benefit expense deferred compensation plan loss gain on deferred compensation plan securities interest income and other interest expense income tax expense net income sales overview net sales were billion in  billion in and billion in net sales increased by in from the net sales increase in was primarily driven by strong growth in sales of our new and mainstream products 
with design incumbency from our nanometer product success  our momentum continues in nanometer 
our fpga market share once again improved 
we continue to see evidence of a tipping point with respect to our opportunity to displace asics and assps  as our newest products are several process generations ahead of mainstream asics and assps  and the resulting fpga cost advantage is accelerating asic and assp displacement 
as we have seen over the last several years  there are long term technology based trends that favor fpgas 
net sales increased by in from  outpacing the general semiconductor  asic  assp and pld markets by a wide margin 
the significant increase in net sales  primarily due to strong growth in sales of our new products  was broad based  covering large and small customer categories and all geographies

sales by product category we classify our products into three categories new  mainstream  and mature and other products 
the composition of each product category is as follows new products include the stratix v  stratix iv  arria v  arria ii  cyclone iv  max v  and hardcopy iv devices 
mainstream products include the stratix iii  cyclone iii  max ii  and hardcopy iii devices 
mature and other products include the stratix ii  stratix  arria gx  cyclone ii  cyclone  classic  max a  max  max a  max b  max s  max  hardcopy ii  hardcopy  flex series  apex series  mercury and excalibur devices  configuration and other devices  intellectual property cores  and software and other tools 
the product categories above approximate the relative life cycle stages of our products 
during  we adjusted product categories to move certain products from new products to mainstream products and certain products from mainstream products to mature and other products 
all prior period data has been adjusted to conform to the current classification 
new products are primarily comprised of our most advanced products 
customers typically select these products for their latest generation of electronic systems 
demand is generally driven by prototyping and production needs 
mainstream products are somewhat older products that are generally no longer design win vehicles 
demand is driven by customers later stage production based needs 
mature products are yet older products with demand generated by the oldest customer systems still in production 
this category also includes sales of software  intellectual property and other miscellaneous devices 
net sales by product category were as follows annual growth rate new mainstream mature and other net sales sales by vertical market the following vertical market data is derived from data that is provided to us by our distributors and end customers 
with a broad base of customers  who in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple market segments  the assignment of net sales to a vertical market requires the use of estimates  judgment and extrapolation 
as such  actual results may differ from those reported 
net sales by vertical market were as follows annual growth rate telecom wireless industrial automation  military automotive networking  computer storage other net sales sales of fpgas and cplds our plds consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
fpgas consist of our stratix  cyclone  arria  apex  flex and acex series  as well as our excalibur and mercury families 
cplds consist of our max  max ii  and classic families 
our other products consist of hardcopy  hardcopy ii and other masked programmed logic devices  configuration devices  software and other tools and ip cores collectively  other products 
net sales of fpgas  cplds and other products were as follows annual growth rate fpga cpld other products net sales sales by geography the following table is based on the geographic location of the original equipment manufacturers or the distributors who purchased our products 
the geographic location of distributors may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
net sales by geography were as follows annual growth rate americas asia pacific emea japan net sales price concessions and product returns from distributors we sell the majority of our products to distributors worldwide at a list price 
our distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated prices based on a variety of factors  including customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive differentiation 
under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of its original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed and we validate the distributor s resale information  including end customer  device  quantity and price  against the distributor price concession that we have approved in advance 
to receive price concessions  distributors must submit the price concession claims to us for approval within days of the resale of the product to an end customer 
primarily because of the uncertainty related to the final price  we defer revenue recognition on sales to distributors until our products are sold from the distributor to the end customer  which is when our price is fixed or determinable 
accordingly  these pricing uncertainties impact our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
total price concessions earned by distributors were billion and billion for and  respectively 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements 
average aggregate price concessions typically range from to of our list price on an annual basis  depending upon the composition of our sales  volume and factors associated with timing of shipments to distributors or payment of price concessions 
our distributors have certain rights under our contracts to return defective  overstocked  obsolete and discontinued products 
our stock rotation program generally allows distributors to return unsold product to altera  subject to certain contract limits  based on a percentage of sales occurring over various periods prior to the stock rotation 
products resold by the distributor to end customers are no longer eligible for return  unless specifically authorized by us 
in addition  we generally warrant our products against defects in material  workmanship and non conformance to our specifications 
returns from distributors totaled million and million for and  respectively 
see note deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors to our consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross margin percentage our gross margin rates are heavily influenced by both vertical market mix and the timing of material cost improvements 
while these variables will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis  our gross margin target over the long term is 
we believe that the gross margin target will enable us to achieve our desired balance between growth and profitability 
our gross margin percentage decreased in by points when compared with the decrease was primarily due to the change in the mix of revenue by vertical market 
gross margin percentage increased in by points compared to  primarily as a result of manufacturing cost reductions  specifically due to improved yields on certain of our new products and increased efficiency in our processes 
research and development expense research and development expense includes costs for compensation and benefits  development masks  prototype wafers  and depreciation and amortization 
these expenditures are for the design of new pld and asic families  the development of process technologies  new package technology  software to support new products and design environments and ip cores 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and focus our efforts on the development of new programmable logic devices that use advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software 
we are currently investing in the development of future silicon products  as well as our quartus ii software  our library of ip cores and other future products

change research and development expense percentage of net sales research and development expense for increased by million  or  compared with the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel related costs due to increased head count to support our product development efforts  a million increase in stock based compensation driven by an increase in our stock price  and a million increase in external costs associated with product development activities 
research and development expense for increased by million  or  when compared with the increase was primarily attributable to the following offsetting factors a million increase in variable compensation expense based on improved operating results for  the absence of a gain of million from the substantive termination of our retiree medical plan during  a million increase in consulting services and a million decrease in external costs due to the timing of product development activities 
see note employee benefit plans for a detailed discussion of the substantive termination of our retiree medical plan in selling  general  and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense primarily includes compensation and benefits related to sales  marketing and administrative employees  commissions and incentives  depreciation  legal  advertising  facilities and travel expenses

selling  general  and administrative expense for increased by million  or  when compared with the increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in variable compensation expense based on higher operating results for  the absence of a gain of million from the substantive termination of our retiree medical plan during  a million increase in commission expenses driven by higher sales volume and the absence of a benefit of million from a change in estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts during deferred compensation plan we allow our us based officers and director level employees to defer a portion of their compensation under the altera corporation non qualified deferred compensation plan the nqdc plan 
since the inception of the nqdc plan  we have not made any contributions to the nqdc plan and we have no commitments to do so in the future 
there are no nqdc plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on investments 
investment income or loss earned by the nqdc plan is recorded as loss gain on deferred compensation plan securities in our consolidated statements of income 
we reported losses gains on nqdc plan assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts resulted from the overall market performance of the underlying securities 
the investment loss gain also represents a decrease increase in the future payout to employees and is recorded as compensation benefit expense deferred compensation plan in our consolidated statements of income 
the compensation benefit expense associated with our deferred compensation plan obligations is offset by losses gains from related securities 
the net effect of the investment income or loss and related compensation expense or benefit has no impact on our income before income taxes  net income  or cash balances 
see note employee benefits plans to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our nqdc plan 
interest income and other interest income and other consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
interest income and other remained relatively flat in compared with as neither returns nor invested balances changed significantly 
the decrease in interest income and other in compared with  was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower returns on our money market funds  partially offset by the effect of an increase in invested balances 
interest expense the year over year decrease for the periods presented in interest expense was due primarily to the slight decrease of the libor rate  which represents the principal basis of our interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our long term credit facility 
income tax expense our effective tax rate reflects the impact of significant amounts of our earnings being taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates substantially below the us statutory rate 
our effective tax rates were for  for and for during  we reversed million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of a statutory notice of deficiency received from the internal revenue service for through in addition  we reversed million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions upon expiration of the statutes of limitations and settlement with certain foreign jurisdictions 
in  we reversed million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions  partially offset by an million charge related to the revaluation of our state deferred tax assets 
additional detail related to the adjustments is presented below 
our effective tax rate was favorably affected by the higher benefit of the adjustments as compared to the significant net decrease in our effective tax rate in when compared with was primarily due to the following factors 
during  we reversed million of liabilities that were originally recorded in for uncertain tax positions as a result of a court decision issued in march  holding that stock based compensation was not required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a us company and its foreign subsidiary 
due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain foreign jurisdictions  we reversed million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
in addition  the decrease in our effective tax rate was also due to the impact of proportionately higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates below the us statutory tax rate  partially offset by the increase in the effective tax rate due to a california law change providing the option to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to california effective january  as a result  we revalued our state deferred tax assets that are expected to reverse after the effective date of the change and recognized discrete income tax expense charges of million during restructuring charges during  we announced a net reduction of approximately positions 
we incurred restructuring related charges of approximately million in the charges were comprised of employee severance costs of approximately million  charges related to the termination of certain external sales representatives of approximately million and operating lease impairment charges of approximately million 
as a result of the workforce reduction  our approximate annual net cost savings are million 
the restructuring charges for are included in our consolidated statements of income as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development expense selling  general  and administrative expense no significant restructuring activities were initiated in or all restructuring obligations were fully settled as of december  see note restructuring charges to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition  liquidity  credit facility and capital resources overview we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations 
we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility  which has been used primarily to fund common stock repurchases and to realign our capital structure 
as of december   we have borrowed million under the facility 
the remaining capacity of million available under the facility also represents a source of liquidity through its maturity date in august the terms of the facility require compliance with certain financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios related to interest coverage and financial leverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
see note credit facility to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the facility 
we are currently evaluating long term financing alternatives to address our outstanding borrowings under the facility plus additional capacity under the facility that currently represents a source of liquidity 
we may use cash from operations and available amounts under the facility for repurchases of our common stock  cash dividends  and capital expenditures 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our current available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  and the facility  plus anticipated cash generated from operations and proceeds from any additional financing activities  will be adequate to finance our operations  stock repurchases  cash dividends and capital expenditures for at least the next year 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by billion during the year ended december  the change in cash and cash equivalents for  and was as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents accounted for and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
operating activities in  our operating activities provided million in cash  primarily attributable to net income of million  adjusted for non cash stock based compensation expense of million net of related tax effects  depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income tax expense of million and changes in working capital accounts 
significant changes in working capital accounts excluding cash and cash equivalents included a million decrease in accounts receivable  net  a million decrease in inventories  a million decrease in other assets  a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities  a million decrease in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors and a million increase in income tax payable 
our sales to distributors are primarily made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns  and we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable at the list selling price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors in the liability section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
decreases in accounts receivable  net associated with lower billings are generally offset by corresponding decreases in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
however  timing differences between gross billings  advances to distributors  discounts earned  collections  revenue recognition and changes in the mix of sales to oems and distributors may result in a temporary interruption to the normal relationship between these two accounts 
the million decrease in accounts receivable  net  and the million decrease in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors principally related to decreased gross billings to distributors and oems associated with less demand for our products in the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in the million decrease in inventories was attributable to proactive management of our inventory levels 
the million decrease in other assets primarily resulted from returns of advances from distributors and a decrease in prepaid amounts 
the repayment of advances by distributors primarily resulted from changes in inventory levels held under distributor funding arrangements 
the million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities was primarily attributable to the decrease in inventory purchased as a result of the previously mentioned proactive management of our inventory levels 
the million increase in income tax payable was primarily attributable to higher tax liabilities due to increased earnings in along with timing related to the payment of taxes 
in  our operating activities provided million in cash  primarily attributable to net income of million  adjusted for non cash stock based compensation expense of million net of related tax effects  depreciation and amortization of million  and deferred income tax expense of million and changes in working capital accounts 
significant changes in working capital accounts excluding cash and cash equivalents included a million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities  a million increase in deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  a million increase in inventories  a million increase in other assets and a million increase in income tax payable

during  our investing activities primarily consisted of net sales of deferred compensation plan securities of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchase of intangible assets of million 
in addition  we made payments related to a business acquisition of million  net of cash acquired 
financing activities during  our financing activities resulted in a use of cash for the repurchase of common stock of million  dividend payments of million  and minimum statutory withholding for vested restricted stock units of million  partially offset by cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to employees through our employee stock plans 
during  our financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to employees through our employee stock plans  partially offset by cash dividend payments of million  principal payments on capital lease obligations of million and minimum statutory withholding for vested restricted stock units of million 
our dividend policy could be impacted in the future by  among other items  future changes in our cash flows from operations and our capital spending needs such as those relating to research and development  investments and acquisitions  common stock repurchases and other strategic investments 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of december   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations wafer purchase obligations credit facility interest on credit facility obligations under service award program electronic design automation software licenses total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense under all operating leases was to million in  and million in each of and due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for the materials once they are completed 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials in interest is based on the outstanding credit facility balance and rate in effect as of december  the contractual amounts to be paid are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the libor rate used in the calculation of the future interest payments is based on rates in effect as of december  
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
we offer to our u

the sap provides employees with one to four weeks of additional paid vacation upon their attainment of five  ten  fifteen  twenty  twenty five and thirty year service anniversaries 
see note employee benefits plans to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million of non cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and maintenance expiring at various dates throughout december due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as income tax payable non current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments pursuant to such agreements have not been material 
we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such agreements would not be significant to our consolidated financial condition or operating results 
impact of foreign currency and inflation we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars 
for us subsidiaries and branches  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and the impact of the remeasurement of local currency assets and liabilities into us dollars in  and were not significant 
we do not enter into foreign exchange transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
common stock repurchases we repurchase shares under our stock purchase program announced on july   which has no specified expiration 
no existing repurchase plans or programs have expired  nor have we decided to terminate any repurchase plans or programs prior to expiration 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program through december   our board of directors has authorized million shares for repurchase and we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of billion 
as of december   million shares remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program 
common stock repurchase activity for was as follows in millions  except per share amounts shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased average price per share no shares were repurchased in or off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
subsequent events on january   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  on january   the internal revenue service issued a statutory notice of deficiency claiming that we owe additional taxes in the amount of million for the fiscal years  and  excluding interest and penalties 
we are evaluating our course of action relating to this assessment 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts such that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results 
new accounting pronouncements the information contained in note significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item under the heading new accounting pronouncements is incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
our investment strategy is focused on preservation of capital while maximizing yields and supporting our liquidity requirements 
our exposure to market risk as a result of changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents  investments in debt instruments and certain interest rate sensitive assets held under the nqdc plan and our credit facility the facility 
our investment portfolio and nqdc plan assets include holdings of various issuers  types and maturity dates 
the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
the actual impact on the fair value of the portfolio in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
our consolidated operating results are affected by  among other factors  interest income on our cash equivalents 
if the interest rate declines  our consolidated operating results may be negatively impacted 
our total borrowings under the facility as of december  were million 
borrowings under this facility bear a variable interest rate at either a eurodollar rate libor or a prime rate  at our option  plus an applicable margin based upon certain financial ratios  determined and payable quarterly 
the interest rate as of december  was libor plus 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the entire facility 
this facility fee varies with certain financial ratios and was as of december  our consolidated operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on the facility in any given period 
due to the variable interest rate on the facility  the fair value of the facility would not likely be materially affected by any future changes in interest rates 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk inherent in the marketable equity securities held in our investment portfolio and our nqdc plan 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of these equity securities would not result in a material impact on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than us dollars 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility  resulting from foreign currency transaction gains and losses and remeasurement of local currency assets and liabilities into us dollars  has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates in effect at december   the resulting transaction gains or losses and the effects of remeasurement would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows
