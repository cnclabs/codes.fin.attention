supervision and regulation the company and our subsidiaries are subject to an extensive system of laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of customers and depositors and not for the protection of our security holders 
these laws and regulations govern such areas as capital  permissible activities  allowance for loan losses  loans and investments  and rates of interest that can be charged on loans 
described below are elements of selected laws and regulations 
the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described 
holding company regulation 
as a bank holding company and financial holding company  we are subject to comprehensive regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  frequently referred to as the federal reserve board frb  under the bank holding company act  as amended by  among other laws  the gramm leach bliley act of the gramm leach bliley act  and by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  enacted on july  we must file reports with the frb and such additional information as the frb may require  and our holding company and non banking affiliates are subject to examination by the frb 
under frb policy  a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks 
under this policy  the frb may require  and has required in the past  a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
the bank holding company act provides that a bank holding company must obtain frb approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if  after such acquisition  it would own or control more than of such shares unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the bank holding company act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities which  by statute or by frb regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks 
the list of activities permitted by the frb includes  among other things lending  operating a savings institution  mortgage company  finance company  credit card company or factoring company  performing certain data processing operations  providing certain investment and financial advice  underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit related insurance  leasing property on a full payout  non operating basis  selling money orders  travelers checks and united states savings bonds  real estate and personal property appraising  providing tax planning and preparation services  and  subject to certain limitations  providing securities brokerage services for customers 
these activities may also be affected by federal legislation 
the gramm leach bliley act amended portions of the bank holding company act to authorize bank holding companies  such as us  directly or through non bank subsidiaries to engage in securities  insurance and other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity 
in order to undertake these activities  a bank holding company must become a financial holding company by submitting to the appropriate federal reserve bank a declaration that the company elects to be a financial holding company and a certification that all of the depository institutions controlled by the company are well capitalized and well managed 
depository institution regulation 
our bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
this regulatory structure includes real estate lending standards  which provide guidelines concerning loan to value ratios for various types of real estate loans  risk based capital rules  including accounting for interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks posed by non traditional activities  rules requiring depository institutions to develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and settlement exposure to their correspondent banks  rules restricting types and amounts of equity investments  and rules addressing various safety and soundness issues  including operations and managerial standards  standards for asset quality  earnings and compensation standards 
capital adequacy requirements 
the frb and fdic have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks 
in addition  these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a bank holding company or bank maintain capital above the minimum levels  based on its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth 
the frb s risk based guidelines establish a two tier capital framework 
tier capital generally consists of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock  qualifying trust preferred securities and non controlling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangibles 
tier capital generally consists of certain hybrid capital instruments and perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt  qualifying preferred stock  loan loss allowance  and unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
the sum of tier and tier capital represents qualifying total capital  at least of which must consist of tier capital 
risk based capital ratios are calculated by dividing tier and total capital by risk weighted assets 
assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk weights  based primarily on relative credit risk 
for bank holding companies  generally the minimum tier risk based capital ratio is and the minimum total risk based capital ratio is 
our tier and total risk based capital ratios under these guidelines at december  were and  respectively 
the frb s leverage capital guidelines establish a minimum leverage ratio determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
at december   we had a leverage ratio of 
see also the section titled capital resources in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the federal regulatory authorities risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord basel i of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee 
the basel committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies and regulations to which they apply 
actions of the committee have no direct effect on banks in participating countries 
in  the basel committee published a new capital accord basel ii to replace basel i 
basel ii provides two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk an internal ratings based approach tailored to individual institutions circumstances and a standardized approach that bases risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in existing risk based capital guidelines 
basel ii also would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures 
a final rule implementing the advanced approaches of basel ii in the united states would apply only to certain large or internationally active banking organizations  or core banks defined as those with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated on balance sheet foreign exposures of billion or more  became effective as of april  certain other us banking organizations would have the option to adopt the requirements of this rule 
we are not required to comply with the advanced approaches of basel ii 
on september   the united states department of treasury the treasury issued a policy statement the treasury policy statement entitled principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms  which contemplates changes to the existing regulatory capital regime involving substantial revisions to major parts of the basel i and basel ii capital frameworks and affecting all regulated banking organizations and other systemically important institutions 
the treasury policy statement calls for  among other things  higher and stronger capital requirements for all banking firms  with changes to the regulatory capital framework to be phased in over a period of several years 
on december   the basel committee issued a set of proposals the capital proposals that would significantly revise the definitions of tier capital and tier capital 
among other things  the capital proposals would re emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of tier capital 
concurrently with the release of the capital proposals  the basel committee also released a set of proposals related to liquidity risk exposure the liquidity proposals 
the liquidity proposals include the implementation of i a liquidity coverage ratio or lcr  designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered  high quality assets sufficient to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario and ii a net stable funding ratio or nsfr  designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon 
the dodd frank act includes certain provisions concerning the capital regulations of the us banking regulators  which are often referred to as the collins amendment 
these provisions are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments  especially trust preferred securities  as regulatory capital 
under the collins amendment  trust preferred securities issued by a company with total consolidated assets of less than billion before may  and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered  but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital 
the banking regulators developed regulations setting minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below 
the frb adopted final regulations effective july   which established a capital floor and amended advanced risk based capital adequacy standards 
the rule mandated that the capital requirements for insured depository institutions be the minimum for covered institutions  a provision of the dodd frank act 
the rule also implemented elements of the collins amendment 
the banking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
the frb has not yet issued proposed rules for these countercyclical capital standards 
in december and january  the basel committee published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as basel iii 
although basel iii is intended to be implemented by participating countries for large  internationally active banks  its provisions are likely to be considered by us banking regulators in developing new regulations applicable to other banks in the united states  including five star bank 
for banks in the united states  among the most significant provisions of basel iii concerning capital are the following a minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets reaching  plus an additional as a capital conservation buffer  by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets reaching by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  plus the additional capital conservation buffer  reaching by after a phase in period 
an additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion  with advance notice 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses applicable when capital ratios fall within the buffer zone 
deduction from common equity of deferred tax assets that depend on future profitability to be realized 
increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk relating to otc derivatives  repos and securities financing activities 
for capital instruments issued on or after january  other than common equity  a loss absorbency requirement such that the instrument must be written off or converted to common equity if a trigger event occurs  either pursuant to applicable law or at the direction of the banking regulator 
a trigger event is an event under which the banking entity would become nonviable without the write off or conversion  or without an injection of capital from the public sector 
the issuer must maintain authorization to issue the requisite shares of common equity if conversion were required 
the basel iii provisions on liquidity include complex criteria establishing the lcr and nsfr 
the purpose of the lcr is to ensure that a bank maintains adequate unencumbered  high quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for days under a severe liquidity stress scenario 
the purpose of the nsfr is to promote more medium and long term funding of assets and activities  using a one year horizon 
although basel iii is described as a final text  it is subject to the resolution of certain issues and to further guidance and modification  as well as to adoption by us banking regulators  including decisions as to whether and to what extent it will apply to us banks that are not large  internationally active banks 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within these categories 
this act imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank s compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet these standards 
the various federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  using the total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures 
these regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a total risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive or order 
an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a total risk based capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least in certain circumstances 
an institution is undercapitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  a total risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than in certain circumstances 
an institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  a total risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
an institution is critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than of total assets 
generally  an institution may be reclassified in a lower capitalization category if it is determined that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice 
as of december   our subsidiary bank met the requirements to be classified as well capitalized 
dividends 
the frb policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition  and that it is inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
furthermore  a bank that is classified under the prompt corrective action regulations as undercapitalized will be prohibited from paying any dividends 
in december  under the treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program  we entered into a securities purchase agreement standard terms with the treasury pursuant to which  among other things  we sold to the treasury for an aggregate purchase price of million   shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price of per share the warrant 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  our ability to declare or pay dividends on any of our shares was limited 
specifically  we were prohibited from paying any dividend with respect to shares of common stock  other junior securities or preferred stock ranking pari passu with the series a preferred stock or repurchasing or redeeming any shares of the our common stock  other junior securities or preferred stock ranking pari passu with the series a preferred stock in any quarter unless all accrued and unpaid dividends were paid on the series a preferred stock for all past dividend periods including the latest completed dividend period  subject to certain limited exceptions 
we fully redeemed the series a preferred stock during the first quarter of and repurchased the warrant in the following quarter 
the complete redemption of the series a preferred stock removed the tarp restrictions pertaining to our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase our common stock  as well as certain restrictions associated with executive compensation 
our primary source for cash dividends is the dividends we receive from our subsidiary bank 
our bank is subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends  including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums 
approval of the new york state department of financial services is required prior to paying a dividend if the dividend declared by the bank exceeds the sum of the bank s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years 
federal deposit insurance assessments 
the bank s deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the deposit insurance fund dif 
upon enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of on october   federal deposit insurance coverage levels under the dif temporarily increased from  to  per deposit category  per depositor  per institution  through december  on may   the helping families save their homes act extended the temporary increase through december  the dodd frank act permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance to  per deposit category  per depositor  per institution retroactive to january   and noninterest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  as the insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of  and to require reporting by  fdic insured institutions 
the fdic also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the dif 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against banks 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement entered into with the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
the fdic maintains the dif by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium on a quarterly basis under a risk based assessment system 
the amount of the assessment is a function of the institution s risk category  of which there are four  and assessment base 
an institution s risk category is determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels and is used to determine the institution s assessment rate 
the assessment rate for risk categories are calculated according to a formula  which relies on supervisory ratings and either certain financial ratios or long term debt ratings 
an insured bank s assessment base is currently determined by its level of deposits 
because the system is risk based  it allows banks to pay lower assessments to the fdic as their capital level and supervisory ratings improve 
by the same token  if these indicators deteriorate  the institution will have to pay higher assessments to the fdic 
under the federal deposit insurance act  the fdic board has the authority to set the annual assessment rate range for the various risk categories within certain regulatory limits and to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions when deemed necessary by the fdic s board 
as part of the deposit insurance fund restoration plan adopted by the fdic in october  on february   the fdic adopted the final rule modifying the risk based assessment system  which set initial base assessment rates between and basis points  beginning april  the fdic imposed an emergency special assessment on june   which totaled thousand for our bank 
in addition  in september  the fdic extended the restoration plan period to eight years 
in november  the fdic adopted a final rule requiring prepayment of quarters of fdic premiums 
the bank s required prepayment amounted to million and was collected in december in october  the fdic adopted a new restoration plan for the dif to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
under the restoration plan  the fdic did not institute the uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates scheduled to take place on january  and maintained the current schedule of assessment rates for all depository institutions 
at least semi annually  the fdic will update its loss and income projections for the dif and  if needed  will increase or decrease assessment rates  following notice and comment rulemaking  if required 
in november  the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to change the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity  as required by the dodd frank act  effective april  the fdic also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the deposit insurance assessment system for large institutions 
the fdic proposed to create a two tier system one for large institutions that have more than billion in assets  and another for highly complex institutions that have over billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over billion in assets 
these proposals did not apply to us or the bank 
on february   the fdic adopted a final rule which redefines the deposit insurance assessment base as required by the dodd frank act 
the final rule sets the deposit insurance assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
it also sets a new assessment rate schedule which reflects assessment rate adjustments including potentially reduced rates tied to unsecured debt and potentially increased rates for brokered deposits 
the final rule became effective on april  under the new rule  our fdic insurance premiums decreased thousand to million in compared to million in transactions with affiliates 
fii and fsb are affiliates within the meaning of the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to  investments in  and certain other transactions with  its parent bank holding company and the holding company s other subsidiaries 
furthermore  bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates also are subject to various collateral requirements 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  every fdic insured institution is obligated  consistent with safe and sound banking practices  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the community reinvestment act requires the appropriate federal banking regulator  in connection with the examination of an insured institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of certain applications  such as a merger or the establishment of a branch 
an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application and will prevent a bank holding company of the institution from making an election to become a financial holding company 
as of its last community reinvestment act examination  five star bank received a rating of outstanding 
interstate banking and branching 
the frb may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of  or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of  a bank located in a state other than the bank holding company s home state  without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state 
the frb may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period not exceeding five years specified by the law of the target bank s home state 
the frb also may not approve an application if the bank holding company and its bank affiliates controls or would control more than ten percent of the insured deposits in the us or  generally  or more of the deposits in the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
individual states may waive the statewide concentration limit 
each state may limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent the limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether these transactions are prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks opted out of interstate mergers prior to june  interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits these acquisitions 
interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limits described above 
privacy rules 
federal banking regulators  as required under the gramm leach bliley act  have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non affiliated third parties 
the privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the president signed the usa patriot act of into law in october this act contains the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the imlafa 
the imlafa substantially broadens existing anti money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the us  imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations  creates new crimes and penalties  compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the us  including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the us  and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers 
the treasury department has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our banking and broker dealer subsidiaries 
the regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
the increased obligations of financial institutions  including us  to identify their customers  watch for and report suspicious transactions  respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  and share information with other financial institutions  requires the implementation and maintenance of internal procedures  practices and controls which have increased  and may continue to increase  our costs and may subject us to liability 
as noted above  enforcement and compliance related activity by government agencies has increased 
money laundering and anti terrorism compliance is among the areas receiving a high level of focus in the present environment 
regulatory reform 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act as amended implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  has or will centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the bureau of consumer financial protection  with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and certain others  including the examination and enforcement powers with respect to any bank with more than billion in assets 
require new capital rules and apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies 
changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less tangible capital 
as a result  this change generally imposes more deposit insurance cost on institutions with assets of billion or more 
increase the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the deposit insurance fund from to and require the fdic  in setting assessments  to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than billion 
provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance  including guidelines or regulations on incentive based compensation and a prohibition on compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation 
made permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance and provided unlimited federal deposit insurance until december  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts and iolta accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
allow de novo interstate branching by banks 
increased the authority of the frb to examine us and our non bank subsidiary 
required all bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress 
restrict proprietary trading by banks  bank holding companies and others  and their acquisition and retention of ownership interests in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds 
this restriction is commonly referred to as the volcker rule 
there is an exception in the volcker rule to allow a bank to organize and offer hedge funds and private equity funds to customers if certain conditions are met 
these conditions include  among others  requirements that the bank provides bona fide investment advisory services  the funds are organized only in connection with such services and to customers of such services  the bank does not have more than a de minimis interest in the funds  limited to a ownership interest in any single fund and an aggregated investment in all funds of of tier capital  the bank does not guarantee the obligations or performance of the funds  and no director or employee of the bank has an ownership interest in the fund unless he or she provides services directly to the funds 
the frb issued proposed rules in november many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us and the financial services industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation may require us to maintain higher capital levels and or increase our cost of operations and limit certain activities or lines of business 
tarp related compensation and corporate governance requirements 
the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was signed into law on october  and authorized the treasury to provide funds to be used to restore liquidity and stability to the us financial system pursuant to the tarp 
under the authority of eesa  treasury instituted the tarp capital purchase program to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy 
as noted above  on december   we participated in this program by issuing  shares of our series a preferred stock to the treasury for a purchase price of million in cash and issued the warrant to the treasury 
participation in the tarp capital purchase program included certain requirements and restrictions regarding payment of dividends and compensation that were expanded significantly by the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  as implemented by the treasury s interim final rule on tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance 
our redemption of the series a preferred stock during the first quarter of  as described under dividends  effectively ended these requirements and restrictions 
incentive compensation 
on april   the federal reserve issued a proposed regulation on incentive compensation policies the incentive compensation proposal intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the incentive compensation proposal  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
banking organizations were instructed to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk taking and implement corrective programs as needed 
where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements  they must be immediately addressed 
additionally  the incentive compensation proposal will require the federal reserve to review  as part of the regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations  such as us  that are not large  complex banking organizations 
these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements 
the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination 
deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect the organization s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions 
enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future 
it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect our ability to hire  retain and motivate our key employees 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of implemented a broad range of corporate governance  accounting and reporting measures for companies that have securities registered under the exchange act  including publicly held bank holding companies such as financial institutions 
specifically  the sarbanes oxley act of and the various regulations promulgated thereunder  established  among other things i requirements for audit committees  including independence  expertise  and responsibilities  ii responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company  iii the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of the reporting company s securities by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer in the twelve month period following the initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  iv the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  v standards for auditors and regulation of audits  including independence provisions that restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  vi disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and their directors and executive officers  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension blackout periods  vii a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  and viii a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws

in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include  among others  the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act and the real estate settlement procedures act 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
the check clearing for the st century act the check act  which became effective on october   creates a new negotiable instrument  called a substitute check  which banks are required to accept as the legal equivalent of a paper check if it meets the requirements of the check act 
the check act is designed to facilitate check truncation  to foster innovation in the check payment system  and to improve the payment system by shortening processing times and reducing the volume of paper checks 
other future legislation and changes in regulations 
in addition to the specific proposals described above  from time to time  various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change banking statutes our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted  and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business 
impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally using historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
in our view  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are generally influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
regulatory and economic policies our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the frb regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are i conducting open market operations in us government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason  the policies of the frb could have a material effect on our earnings

risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report on form k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
further  to the extent that any of the information contained in this annual report on form k constitutes forward looking statements  the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
credit risks if we experience greater credit losses than anticipated  earnings may be adversely impacted 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral  and we provide an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  if our assumptions or judgments are wrong  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses 
we may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators  to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions  or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio 
the actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions 
geographic concentration may unfavorably impact our operations 
substantially all of our business and operations are concentrated in the western and central new york region 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas 
deterioration in economic conditions in our market could increase loan delinquencies  increase problem assets and foreclosures  increase claims and lawsuits  decrease the demand for our products and services  and decrease the value of collateral for loans  especially real estate  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  the value of assets associated with non performing loans and collateral coverage 
generally  we make loans to small to mid sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market areas could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our business  financial condition and performance 
for example  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of these loans inadequately collateralized 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  the impact on our results of operations could be materially adverse 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about or from customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties  or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports  or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory legal compliance risks we are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by changes in banking laws  regulations and regulatory practices 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination 
this regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing consumer credit  and anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws  but also capital adequacy  asset quality and risk  management ability and performance  earnings  liquidity  and various other factors 
as part of this regulatory structure  we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
under this structure the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine  among other things  that our operations are unsafe or unsound  fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies 
this supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct  growth and profitability of our operations 
any failure on our part to comply with current laws  regulations  other regulatory requirements or safe and sound banking practices or concerns about our financial condition  or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us  could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation 
ongoing financial reform legislation may result in new regulations that could require us to maintain higher capital levels and or increase our costs of operations or limit certain activities or lines of business 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
this new law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the rulemaking of the dodd frank act will not be known for many months or years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us 
however  compliance with this new law and its implementing regulations are expected to result in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
new or changing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact our strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a company s stockholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in the section captioned supervision and regulation included in part i  item  business 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
changes in new york state banking regulations or other laws could adversely affect us 
as of october  the nys banking department and the nys insurance department merged into a single department of financial services  or dfs 
beginning april   the superintendent of the dfs may assess expenses in such proportion as he or she deems just and reasonable against banks and insurers 
the dfs is authorized to create a special account called the consumer protection account  which will consist of fees and penalties received by the department of state and dfs  as well as other monies received in the form of penalties 
these monies will be available to the dfs to pay for costs related to its consumer and investor protection activities 
if the consumer protection account is insufficient to cover those costs  the balance would be recoverable through assessments against the industry 
the bill makes new york s wild card authority that was set to expire september  permanent 
under this authority  the banking board has the power to grant to new york chartered banking organizations  as well as licensed foreign bank branches and agencies  powers possessed by a counterpart federally chartered banking institution 
in recent years  credit unions and savings institutions have lobbied in the state of new york to allow local government entities such as cities  towns  counties  public schools  fire districts and public libraries the option of depositing public funds in local credit unions or community savings institutions  a line of business currently serviced primarily by commercial banks  including our bank 
these changes or the possibility of these changes could adversely affect us 
operational risks if our security systems  or those of merchants  merchant acquirers or other third parties containing information about customers  are compromised  we may be subject to liability and damage to our reputation 
as part of our business  we collect  process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties 
customer data also may be stored on systems of third party service providers and merchants that may have inadequate security systems 
third party carriers regularly transport customer data  and may lose sensitive customer information 
unauthorized access to our networks or any of our other information systems potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others 
if our security systems or those of merchants  processors or other third party service providers are compromised such that this confidential information is disclosed to unauthorized parties  we may be subject to liability 
for example  in the event of a security breach  we may incur losses related to fraudulent use of debit cards issued by us as well as the operational costs associated with reissuing cards 
although we take preventive measures to address these factors  such measures are costly and may become more costly in the future 
moreover  these measures may not protect us from liability  which may not be adequately covered by insurance  or from damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 
as part of our normal operations  we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations 
we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity  including misappropriation of assets  fraudulent financial reporting  and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected 
our systems or our third party service providers systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code  or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information 
such disclosure could  among other things seriously damage our reputation  allow competitors access to our proprietary business information  subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data  result in the loss of our existing customers  subject us to regulatory action  and require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and core application processing 
while we have selected these third party vendors carefully  we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively 
replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense  and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them 
further  the rural location of our principal executive offices and many of our bank branches make it difficult for us to attract skilled people to such locations 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our markets  years of industry experience  and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
the potential for business interruption exists throughout our organization 
integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems  operational infrastructure  relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in our day to day and ongoing operations 
failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size  scale and scope 
this includes  but is not limited to  operational or technical failures  ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected  as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly 
although management has established policies and procedures  including implementation and testing of a comprehensive contingency plan  to address such failures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our expansion efforts  particularly through new and acquired branches  may not be successful if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
a key component of our strategy to grow and improve profitability is to expand our branch network into communities within or adjacent to markets where we currently conduct business 
we intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business 
operating branches outside of our current market areas may subject us to additional risk  including the local risks related to the new market areas  management of employees from a distance  additional credit risks  logistical operational issues and management time constraints 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities  and  if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions in the future  branch acquisitions  or other business growth initiatives or undertakings 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities  that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities  if undertaken  will be successful 
while we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage the costs and implementation risks associated with this strategy so that expansion of our branch network will be profitable 
we may fail to realize any benefits and may incur unanticipated losses related to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume from current or future acquisitions 
on january   five star bank entered into an agreement to acquire four retail banking branches currently owned by hsbc bank usa  na and four retail banking branches currently owned by first niagara bank  na the transactions are subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals  and are expected to close by the end of the third quarter of the success of this acquisition and future acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to successfully combine the businesses and assets we acquired with our business  and our ability to successfully manage the loan portfolios that were acquired 
as with any acquisition involving a financial institution  there may also be business and service changes and disruptions that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to close their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions 
it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of ongoing business  or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees  or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions 
the loss of some of our key employees or those of the branches being acquired could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct business in the markets in which those branches operated  which could adversely affect our financial results 
integration efforts will also divert attention and resources from our management 
in addition  general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our ability to successfully integrate these operations 
if we experience difficulties with the integration process  the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully  or at all  or may take longer to realize than expected 
finally  any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 
external risks we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other interest earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
also  our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet 
our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
from december through june  the us economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the us was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and reduced tax collections 
market conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which  in turn  has led to past increases in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
our financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer  is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate  in the state of new york and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during and  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while economic conditions in the new york  the united states and worldwide have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
such conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our investment securities portfolio at december  is comprised of municipal securities issued by or on behalf of new york and its political subdivisions  agencies or instrumentalities  the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax 
risks associated with investing in municipal securities include political  economic and regulatory factors which may affect the issuers 
the fiscal concerns facing new york may lead credit rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations 
it is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade in new york s debt obligations 
in the event new york was downgraded  local municipalities with a high dependency on state aid could be adversely impacted 
our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the policies of the federal reserve impact us significantly 
the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold 
those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing 
changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
federal reserve policies can also affect our borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
for example  a tightening of the money supply by the federal reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower s products and services 
this could adversely affect the borrower s earnings and ability to repay its loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our market value could result in an impairment of goodwill 
our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when triggering events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization  significant declines in our expected future cash flows  significant adverse changes in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in impairment of goodwill 
at december   we had goodwill of million  representing approximately of shareholders equity 
if impairment of goodwill was determined to exist  we would be required to write down our goodwill as a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
for further discussion  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting  and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity risks liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of cash 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us 
our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity 
in such events  our cost of funds may increase  thereby reducing our net interest income  or we may need to sell a portion of our investment and or loan portfolio  which  depending upon market conditions  could result in us realizing a loss 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
in addition  we are highly regulated  and our regulators could require us to raise additional common equity in the future 
we and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets  including the preparation of stress case scenarios  and as a result of those assessments we could determine  or our regulators could require us  to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors of the bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets  or a downgrade of our debt rating  may adversely affect our capital costs and ability to raise capital and  in turn  our liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from dividends from our bank subsidiary 
these dividends are the principal source of funds we use to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock  and to pay interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary and nonbank subsidiary may pay to us 
also  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event our bank subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service debt  pay obligations  or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock 
the inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks related to an investment in our common stock the market price for our common stock varies  and you should purchase common stock for long term investment only 
although our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market  we cannot assure you that there will  at any time in the future  be an active trading market for our common stock 
even if there is an active trading market for our common stock  we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell all of your shares of common stock at one time or at a favorable price  if at all

we may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation  which could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets  or by issuing additional debt or equity securities  which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper  medium term notes  senior notes  subordinated notes  preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities 
in the event of our liquidation  our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings 
further  market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future 
we may not pay dividends on our common stock 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and certain banking laws may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and federal and state banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may discourage others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
