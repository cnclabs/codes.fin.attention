item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page climate change the growing concerns about climate change and the related imposition by governments of more stringent regulations may provide us with new or expanded business opportunities 
the company seeks to capitalize on the green revolution by providing solutions to companies pursuing alternative fuel products and technologies such as biofuels  gas to liquids  and others  emission control technologies including mercury emissions and other similar solutions 
as demand for  and legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of  alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies that limit or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions increase  we continue to invest in  and expand our product offerings of  alternative fuel technologies 
as a result of the investments in alternative fuel technology products and services to date and our continued focus on these growth areas  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise if new legislation is enacted

recent acquisitions and joint ventures over the last three years  we have devoted resources to acquisitions and joint ventures  including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses 
these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business  provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries 
following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years 
on may   we announced that we had expanded our presence in the biofuels market with the acquisition of catilin inc based in ames  iowa  catilin is a technology leader in the development and application of heterogeneous biodiesel catalysis 
catilin s technology and products will further strengthen our offerings for the renewable fuels market and will also provide benefit toward a number of research and development and distribution synergies resulting from the acquisition 
on december   we announced that we had signed a memorandum of understanding to build a world scale hpc production plant on the site of our existing joint venture f brica carioca de catalisadores sa fcc sa in santa cruz  brazil with petrobras 
the new facility will complement existing production of fcc catalysts 
we are also further enhancing our partnership with petrobras by engaging in a joint technical cooperation aimed at the further development of advanced hpc products  mirroring our very successful existing cooperation in the area of fcc catalysts 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries on september   we announced the purchase of certain property and equipment in yeosu  south korea in connection with our plans for building a metallocene polyolefin catalyst and trimethyl gallium tmg manufacturing site 
the site will effectively mirror albemarle s world scale metallocene polyolefin catalyst and tmg capabilities located in baton rouge  louisiana 
on october   we entered into an agreement with ibn hayyan plastic products company tayf  an affiliate of saudi basic industries corporation sabic  to form a joint venture called saudi organometallic chemicals company socc 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  the two parent companies will build a world scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the arabian gulf industrial city of al jubail 
start up of this facility is anticipated in late employees as of december   we had  employees of whom  or  are employed in the us   or  are employed in europe   or  are employed in asia and  or  are employed in the middle east 
approximately of our us employees are unionized 
we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations baton rouge  louisiana united steel workers usw  orangeburg  south carolina international brotherhood of teamsters industrial trades division ibt  and pasadena  texas united steel workers usw  sheet metal workers international association smwia  united association of journeymen apprentices of plumbing and pipefitting industry uajappi  and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew 
we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions  and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than years 
bargaining agreements expire at our orangeburg  south carolina location in  our pasadena  texas location in and our baton rouge  louisiana location in we have two works councils representing the majority of our european sites amsterdam  the netherlands and bergheim  germany covering approximately employees 
in addition  we have approximately employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth  united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives 
in september  we entered into consultation processes under local laws at our amsterdam and bergheim locations for restructuring programs that included planned reductions in force

risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
adverse conditions in the global economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products  negatively impacting our operating results 
our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to global economic downturns including credit market tightness which can impact our liquidity as well as our customers and suppliers declining consumer and business confidence  fluctuating commodity prices  volatile exchange rates  and other challenges that can affect the global economy 
our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses  cash flow shortages  and difficulty obtaining financing 
as a result  existing or potential customers can delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion 
further  suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions  which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
if the current weakness in much of the global economy continues for an extended period or deepens significantly  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly 
increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 
we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter 
in addition  the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
in addition  crop pricing and timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals 
changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  our fine chemistry segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian producers 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and more cost effective catalysts products 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches 
attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated 
these attempts  which might be related to industrial or other espionage  include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users  among others 
we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence  but in some cases  we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects 
the theft  unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and or confidential business information could harm our competitive position  reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business 
to the extent that any cyber security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers or licensees confidential information  we may incur liability as a result 
our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the us we and our joint ventures currently have over facilities located outside the us  including facilities and offices located in austria  australia  belgium  brazil  france  germany  hungary  india  italy  japan  jordan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  russia  saudi arabia  singapore  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  changes in foreign laws and tax rates or us laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed  impose new and additional taxes or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits  foreign countries may adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  trade sanctions could result in losing access to customers and suppliers in those countries  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  and our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate  and we have ongoing capital projects in  high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture  a delay or cancellation of those capital projects and negatively impact our future growth and profitability 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets  liabilities  net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  korean won  chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices or curtail production 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of  or exposure to  such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 
we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 
growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations to which we may become subject 
potentially  some form of us federal regulation is forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide co and or cap and trade legislation 
additionally  some of our operations are within other jurisdictions that have  or are developing  regulatory regimes governing greenhouse gas emissions 
for example  we have operations in the european union  brazil  china  japan  jordan  saudi arabia  singapore and the united arab emirates  which have implemented measures to achieve objectives under the kyoto protocol  an international agreement linked to the united nations framework convention on climate change which set binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol is set to expire in and global attention is focused on the development of a successor global policy framework 
the outcome of new legislation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional regulation  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions 
while certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control  compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us  including  among other things  increased production costs or additional taxes or reduced emission allowances 
we may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations through our contractual terms  which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth 
furthermore  the potential impacts of climate change and related regulation on our customers are highly uncertain and may adversely affect our operations 
contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us or not have the financial capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation 
if our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
regulation  or the threat of regulation  of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have marketed methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulations prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january  with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 
recently  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities  legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants 
we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products  which are used in a variety of applications 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether  which was banned for some applications in the states of washington  maine  oregon and vermont 
in  the state of vermont passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses and upholstered furniture after july   and in televisions and computers after july  the state of oregon also passed a ban on the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant after january  in december  we  along with other leading producers announced a voluntary withdrawal  in cooperation with the epa  from the production and sale of decabromodiphenyl ether in the us over a period of three to four years 
a similar agreement was reached later with canada 
bills to restrict or ban the use of decabromodiphenyl ether are still under consideration in several us states 
norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april  except for certain transportation applications 
on april   the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive  ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption 
as a consequence  the use of decabromodiphenyl 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july  in  the republic of india decided to adopt similar legislation  effective january  in  less than of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether 
none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
additionally  agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants  including decabromodiphenyl ether  hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a 
we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants 
the persistent organic pollutants review committee  a scientific body to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants pops  recommended in october that hexabromocyclododecane be listed under the convention 
the united nations unep agency continues its evaluation of hexabromocyclododecane  no action restricting the use of hexabromocyclododecane is expected before mid in february  the european union included hexabromocyclododecane on a list of substances published under annex xiv of the reach regulation 
our expectation is that the sale of hexabromocyclododecane could be banned in europe under the reach process as soon as in  approximately of our net sales were derived from hexabromocyclododecane 
additional government regulations  including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants  would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
in addition  the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
natural disasters and weather related matters could impact our results of operations 
in and again in the third quarter of  major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials  which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products 
if similar weather related matters or other natural disasters occur in the future  they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
we are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail 
additionally  severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers 
future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  if at all  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we may incur significant charges in the event we close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges that could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
our collective bargaining agreements expire in  and in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the us  the netherlands  germany  belgium  and japan  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 
during  we made million of voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans  and in we made million of voluntary contributions to these plans 
we anticipate that the funded status of each of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans will be at least in and  therefore  the plans should not be subject to benefit limitations in conjunction with the pension protection act of additional voluntary pension contributions in and after may vary depending on factors such as asset returns  then current interest rates  and legislative changes 
the amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world 
as an american chemistry council member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 
new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on a weighted average interest rate of and outstanding borrowings at december  of million  our annual interest expense would be approximately million 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rate applicable to the variable portion of such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our september credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in our september credit agreement  the indentures governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see financial condition and liquidity long term debt in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page a downgrade of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our september credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services  or s p and moody s investors services  or moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our september credit agreement 
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities 
credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results  actions that we take  their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy 
actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining  upgrading  or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading 
downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of future financing  could limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures  our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures 
a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures 
as a result  our ability to service our debt is largely dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends  loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us 
payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures will be contingent upon our subsidiaries or joint ventures earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
in addition  there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non us subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us 
the instruments governing our indebtedness do not limit our acquisitions and may allow us to incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness in relation to acquisitions 
we have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions 
a part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement and expand our distribution network 
the terms of our indebtedness do not limit the number or scale of acquisitions that we may complete 
because the consummation of acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses involves significant risk  this means that investors in our securities will be subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy

on july   we received a notice of violation  the nov from the us environmental protection agency region  or epa  regarding the implementation of the pharmaceutical maximum achievable control technology standards at our plant in orangeburg  south carolina 
the alleged violations include i the applicability of the specific regulations to certain intermediates manufactured at the plant  ii failure to comply with certain reporting requirements  iii improper evaluation and testing to properly implement the regulations and iv the sufficiency of the leak detection and repair program at the plant 
in the second quarter of  the company was served with a complaint by the epa in the united states district court for the district of south carolina  based on the alleged violations set out in the nov seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief 
the complaint was subsequently amended to add the state of south carolina as a plaintiff 
we intend to vigorously defend this action 
any settlement or finding adverse to us could result in the payment by us of fines  penalties  capital expenditures  or some combination thereof 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with any certainty the outcome of this litigation or the financial impact which may result therefrom

outlook for most of we saw strong performance in the global markets that we serve  with our businesses being well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities as well as opportunities to invest in those markets that continue to bring new demand 
during the third quarter of  we began to see expected signs of volume softness affecting mainly our polymer solutions segment which we attribute to end market response to global economic weakness 
we are closely monitoring customer order patterns and other performance trends in our businesses overall and the markets which they serve in light of these current uncertainties as well as working to manage potential headwinds such as increased raw material and energy costs  pension and other personnel costs 
overall  our business fundamentals remain strong  and we believe that if the end markets we serve begin to stabilize and accelerate over the course of we should continue to make progress towards our long term growth objectives 
polymer solutions our pricing programs  combined with favorable impacts from foreign currency  resulted in strong year over year financial performance for  especially in our fire safety business 
improved pricing helped offset raw material inflation as well as fund further investment in new products and technologies 
however  during the third quarter of and through the end of the year  we began to see signs of softening demand in our fire safety business largely in mineral flame retardants which we believe was attributable to end market order patterns in response to the current weakness in the global economy 
we are closely monitoring customer order patterns in this business for indications of sustained slow growth 
however  we believe our business fundamentals in this sector remain strong  and combined with our competitive position  product innovations  pricing initiatives to offset raw material inflation and overall operating discipline  we believe the company continues to be well positioned to manage through any potentially slower growth trends in the markets served by this business 
on a long term basis  we continue to believe improving global standards of living  coupled with the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations and global climate initiatives  should drive continued demand for fire safety products 
further  we continue to focus on globalization in this segment  with our antioxidants facility in shanghai positioning us well for growth in china

catalysts favorable impacts from overall improved volumes  higher pricing to counter significant raw material price increases  and stronger year over year results from our equity joint ventures drove net sales and earnings growth in our catalysts segment during increased global demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements are expected to drive growth in our refinery catalysts business 
we expect growth in our performance catalysts solutions division to come from growing global demand for plastics  particularly in asia and the middle east 
our fluidized catalytic cracking  or fcc  refinery catalysts business has seen significant price increases in rare earth materials due to recent chinese export quotas 
our steps to maintain sufficient security of supply for the foreseeable future  as well as cost pass through mechanisms that have been implemented  are helping us sustain current profitability levels for this business in the current year 
new market penetrations and introduction of innovative cost effective products for the refining and polyolefins industries contributed to the segment s performance in we believe our focus on advanced product development in catalysts is achieving commercial success  and we have introduced new value added refining solutions and technologies that enable refiners to increase yields  a critical advantage for refiners 
our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned  enabling us to continue to bring innovative technologies to the market

we believe we can sustain healthy margins with continued focus on the two strategic areas in our fine chemistry segment maximizing our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and continued growth of our fine chemistry services business 
in our performance chemicals sector  we saw strong growth over the course of as demand across our bromine franchise expanded  with new applications widening the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives and global supply remaining tight 
our completion fluids business regained traction in and we believe this trend should continue into as global drilling activity continues to operate at significantly higher levels than in the prior year 
further  we have commenced an expansion of our bromine production capacity at our jbc joint venture in safi  jordan 
additionally  we are encouraged by long term drivers in the us and china for our mercury control business 
we are positioned to provide these markets with sensible  sustainable solutions to meet new regulatory demands  including emission prevention and control directives for coal fueled power plants in the us and china and waste reduction initiatives in the cement production industry in connection with the new cement mact mercury emission standard 
in response to the emerging opportunities in this market  during the third quarter of  we formed our new environmental division 
this division will function within our fine chemistry segment and will provide environmental control solutions to the coal fired utility  cement kiln and industrial boiler markets through the development of multi pollutant control technologies 
we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 
we believe the global supply demand gap will continue to tighten as demand for existing and new uses of bromine expand and global supply remains tight 
we are positioned to expand capacity as needed at our low cost production facilities 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our fine chemistry services product pipeline is strong and opportunities are expanding 
our pharmaceutical and crop protection businesses continue to deliver solid results 
we expect product development opportunities to continue  such as partnering with exxonmobil corporation to make a specialty lubricant and with pharmaceutical developers like siga technologies in their manufacture of the st smallpox drug 
also  in the third quarter of we announced our agreement to provide customer scale up and production services for synthetic  renewable base oils for the lubricants market to novvi sa  a joint venture between amyris  inc and cosan sa ind stria e com rcio  focused on the development  production  marketing and distribution of high performance renewable base oils 
our technical expertise  manufacturing capabilities and speed to market allow us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries 
we believe we will continue to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 
corporate and other we continue to focus on cash generation  working capital management and process efficiencies 
our global effective tax rate for was  and we expect our rate for will be approximately 
however  our tax rate continues to be subject to potential variability based on the jurisdictions in which income is actually earned and changes in tax rates and laws 
further  in  we expect our noncash us pension and postretirement expense could increase up to million over expense amounts 
the strong performance of our businesses in enabled us to announce two dividend increases 
in the first quarter of we increased our quarterly dividend payout to cents per share  followed by another increase to cents per share on october  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  we repurchased three million shares of our common stock in the third quarter of for approximately million under our existing share repurchase program  and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis 
on september   we amended and restated our previous million credit facility 
under the terms of the amended and restated five year  revolving  unsecured credit facility  we have the ability to borrow million with an option for another million subject to the terms of the agreement  which we believe will give us continuing liquidity for both our short term and long term operating needs 
we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates estimates  assumptions and reclassifications the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a reporting unit basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and iii the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
where the company incurs pre production design and development costs under long term supply 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries contracts  these costs are expensed where they relate to the products sold unless contractual guarantees for reimbursement exist 
conversely  these costs are capitalized if they pertain to equipment that we will own and use in producing the products to be supplied and expect to utilize for future revenue generating activities 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to not be amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value 
we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows 
future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation incorporates industry weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and  therefore  are beyond our control 
we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 
definite lived intangible assets  such as purchased technology  patents  customer lists and trade names  are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance 
see note  goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated financial statements included in item beginning on page pension plans and other postretirement benefits under authoritative accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
as required  we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan s funded status as of the measurement date 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets for these investments 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits pre premium cap  and the related healthcare trend rates 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rates for the us plans  we establish a range of reasonable rates based on methods developed by subject matter experts that reflect current market conditions 
for  we relied on methods developed by citigroup  aonhewitt  and milliman to establish a range of acceptable discount rates based on authoritative accounting guidance 
these methods calculate discount rates based on high quality bond data and the projected plan cash flows 
we believe our selected discount rates accurately reflect market conditions as of the december  measurement date 
in selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans  we relied on aonhewitt methods  including the aonhewitt top quartile and a yield curve derived from fixed income security yields 
the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing aa graded corporate bonds in the euro zone without special features or options  which could affect the duration 
in some countries  the yield curve is based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk 
payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve 
for each plan  the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries at december   the weighted average discount rate was reduced for the pension plans from to and for the other postretirement plans from to to reflect market conditions as of the december  measurement date 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
for the years and  the weighted average expected rate of return on domestic pension plan assets was 
there has been no change to the assumed rate of return on us pension plan assets effective january  also  there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase changed to from for the pension plans 
the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase remained unchanged at for the other postretirement plans at december  in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends in relation to the employer paid premium cap 
at december   the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the pre and post per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was reduced to zero as the employer paid premium cap is expected to meet the cap starting january  for  the assumed trend rate for pre coverage is per year  ultimately decreasing to zero in the year due to the employer paid premium cap 
the assumed trend rate for post coverage is expected to be zero due to the employer paid premium cap 
a increase or decrease in the us health care cost trend rate would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation and service and interest benefit cost components 
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions  primarily in the us in thousands favorable unfavorable increase decrease increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost actuarial assumptions discount rate pension other postretirement benefits expected return on plan assets pension other postretirement benefits rate of increase decrease in per capital cost of covered health care benefits not applicable

gains losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets 
see note  pension plans and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item beginning on page income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses  capital 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries losses and certain tax credit carryovers 
a valuation allowance  reducing deferred tax assets  is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character 
although realization is not assured  we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized 
we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
once the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to since the irs has completed a review of our income tax returns through  or for any us state income tax audit prior to with respect to jurisdictions outside the us  we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to during  we completed tax audits for one of our belgian companies for and  our japanese company for through  and two of our chinese companies through during  we completed a tax audit for one of our belgian companies for the tax year 
no significant tax was assessed as a result of these audits 
we were informed in that german tax authorities would commence an audit of one of our german companies for through  and chinese tax authorities would commence an audit of one of our chinese companies for through while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
since the timing of resolutions and or closure of tax audits are uncertain  it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months 
our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions  relating to a number of issues  up to approximately million as a result of closure of tax statutes 
we have designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries 
our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits  or e p  principles 
in general  to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e p amounts  deferred taxes have not been provided  as they are essentially permanent in duration 
the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
stock based compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
to the extent restricted stock awards  performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k filings 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we are required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item we have a dedicated sox team to facilitate ongoing internal control testing  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff in their control processes and assist in the overall assessment of internal control over financial reporting

financial condition and liquidity overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets  funding working capital and repayment of debt 
additionally  we have made total contributions to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also periodically repurchase shares of our common stock on an opportunistic basis  including million in share repurchases during we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory 
we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our september credit agreement  which is discussed below  to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash flow our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to our ending balance at december  of million 
our cash flows from operations provided million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows from operations in versus was primarily due to an increase in the profitability of our businesses  favorable impacts from changes in working capital mainly accounts receivable in connection with our ongoing working capital management initiatives and lower pension contributions  offset in part by lower deferred income taxes 
the decrease of million in operating cash flows for compared to was due primarily to an increase in working capital mainly inventories and accounts receivable in connection with the global economic recovery and pension contributions  offset in part by the strong increase in profitability of our businesses 
in  our operating cash flows funded capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of million  repurchases of common stock of million  dividends to shareholders of million  and million in long term debt repayments during the year 
in september  we amended and restated our previous million credit facility 
see long term debt below 
our cash flows from operations in were used mainly for funding capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment of million  dividends to shareholders of million  repurchases of common stock of million and normal debt repayments during the year 
additionally  our cash balances in were unfavorably impacted million as a result of the january  deconsolidation of our stannica llc joint venture 
further  we raised approximately million in borrowings in  including million in net proceeds from our senior notes offering in december for the year  our cash flows from operating activities funded capital expenditures of million for plant machinery and equipment  million in net repayments of debt  million in dividends to shareholders and million in obligations arising from the port de bouc facility divestiture 
net current assets decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in net current assets was due primarily to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued expenses  partly offset mainly by increases in inventories and accounts receivable 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and were incurred mainly for plant machinery and equipment 
we expect our capital expenditures to approach million in for capacity increases  cost reduction  and continuity of operations projects 
while we continue to closely monitor our cash generation  working capital management and capital spending in light of weakness in the global economy  we are optimistic that as we enter into we will have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives 
additionally  we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our september credit agreement 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 
at december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents were comprised of approximately million and million  respectively  held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are permanently reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the us through funding of capital expenditures  acquisitions  research  operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations 
from time to time  we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the us for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends  but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be permanently reinvested or whose earnings qualify as previously taxed income as defined by the internal revenue code 
for the years ended december   and we repatriated approximately million  million and million in cash  respectively  as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities 
long term debt we currently have outstanding million of senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in  or the senior notes 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis using the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points for the senior notes maturing in and basis points for the senior notes maturing in  plus  in each case  accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
however  the senior notes are redeemable as a whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after three months prior to the maturity date  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption 
holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase such notes at upon a change of control triggering event  as defined in the related indenture agreement 
the principal amounts of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include  among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times  failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods  an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity  and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 
we believe that as of december   we were  and currently are  in compliance with all of the covenants of the indentures governing the senior notes 
in september  we amended and restated our previous million credit facility 
the amended and restated five year  revolving  unsecured credit facility matures on september  and i increased the borrowing capacity to million from million  ii provides for an additional million in credit  if needed  subject to the terms of the agreement  iii provides for the ability to extend the maturity date under certain conditions  iv eliminated the covenant that required a minimum level of consolidated tangible domestic assets  and v increased the interest rate spread and commitment fees applicable to the company s borrowings under the credit facility 
fees and expenses of million were incurred and paid in connection with this new agreement 
borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the libor for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from to  depending on the company s credit rating applicable from time to time 
the applicable margin on the facility was as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under the september credit agreement as of december  borrowings under the september credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants i consolidated funded debt  as defined in the agreement  must be less than or equal to times consolidated ebitda  as defined in 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the agreement  which reflects adjustments for certain non recurring or unusual items such as restructuring charges  facility divestiture charges and other significant non recurring items  or herein consolidated adjusted ebitda  as of the end of any fiscal quarter  ii with the exception of liens specified in our new credit facility  liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness  other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the new credit facility  would exceed of consolidated net worth  as defined in the agreement  and iii with the exception of indebtedness specified in our new credit facility  subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between of consolidated net worth  as defined in the agreement  and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement 
we believe that as of december   we were  and currently are  in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we previously maintained a million five year unsecured revolving senior credit facility  which we referred to as the march credit agreement 
the total spread and fees ranged from to over the libor applicable to the currency of the borrowing and were based on our credit rating as determined by the major rating agencies 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the march credit agreement at december  the non current portion of our long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow million under our september credit agreement and million under other existing lines of credit  subject to various financial covenants under our september credit agreement 
we have the ability to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the september credit agreement  as applicable 
therefore  the amounts outstanding under our other existing credit lines are classified as long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements  including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately million at december  none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has  or is likely to have  a material effect on our current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
other obligations the following table summarizes our projected contractual obligations for plant construction  purchases of equipment  various take or pay and throughput agreements and obligations under our existing credit agreements based on projected borrowings in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligation expected interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations rental take or pay throughput agreements letters of credit and guarantees capital projects total these amounts are based on interest rates of for the senior notes and for the senior notes 
a weighted average interest rate of was used for our remaining long term debt obligations and capital lease for  and for the years and thereafter the weighted average interest rate used was 
interest payments on our variable rate foreign bank loans are calculated through september when our credit agreement expires 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the september credit agreement 
these amounts primarily relate to contracts entered into with certain third party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes 
in order to secure materials  sometimes for long durations  these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe 
amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions 
we believe that the expected contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans  including our serp  should approximate million 
we may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount 
we have made million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries the liability related to uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 
liquidity outlook we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our september credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures  make pension contributions and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets  which may require additional liquidity 
while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions  an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments  decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit  renew their extensions of credit or provide new financing 
while the corporate bond market remains strong  availability of bank debt is more limited than in prior years due to a variety of factors  including tighter bank regulations and more stringent bank capital requirements in the wake of the financial crisis  and most recently  increased concern regarding fallout from the european sovereign debt issues 
if bank debt remains relatively less prevalent  we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature 
it is also possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by market or counterparty factors at a time when we would need or desire to do so  which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions 
in addition  our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability 
at december   we had the ability to borrow in excess of million under our september credit agreement and other existing lines of credit  subject to various financial covenants under our september credit agreement 
with generally strong cash generative businesses and no significant debt maturities before  we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december   which represent an important source of our liquidity 
our cash is invested in short term investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities 
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local  and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a prp  and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a prp  our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to our operations 
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were million  million and million in  and  respectively  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  a decrease of million from million at december  we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis  although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued new accounting guidance relating to separating consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
under this guidance  multiple deliverable arrangements will be accounted for separately rather than on a combined basis by selecting the best evidence of selling price among vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence or estimated selling price 
this new guidance  effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  new accounting guidance was issued by the fasb that requires additional disclosures about amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons therefor 
additionally  entities are now required to present information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable level inputs 
the amendments also clarified that entities should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class  or subset  of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position  and entities should disclose information about inputs and valuation techniques for level and level fair value measurements  whether recurring or nonrecurring 
these amendments were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level inputs  which were effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of this guidance did not have a have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb  amended its accounting guidance related to the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
under the amended guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period 
the amendments also require public entities to provide a description of the nature and amount of any material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to business combination s that are included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
these amendments became effective for us on january  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance relating to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
for fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy  the new guidance requires disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs  if any 
entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are not recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which fair value is disclosed 
the new requirements clarify that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only apply to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
the new requirements also specify that in the absence of a level input  a reporting entity should incorporate a premium or a discount in a fair value measurement if a market participant would take into account such an input in pricing an asset or liability 
additionally  the new guidance introduces an option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities with offsetting positions on a net basis if certain criteria are met 
for public entities  these new requirements become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the current option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
however  under the new guidance  comprehensive income and its components must still be presented under one of two new alternatives 
under the first alternative  the components of other comprehensive income and the components of net income may be presented in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income 
under the second alternative  a statement of other comprehensive income would immediately follow the statement of net income and must be shown with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements 
under either alternative  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the company will adopt these new financial statement presentation requirements effective january  with retrospective application to all prior periods presented 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test under existing accounting guidance is required to be performed 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
these new provisions are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances 
we do not expect this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that will require entities to disclose information about instruments including derivatives and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
these new provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods  and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we are assessing the impact of these new requirements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  korean won  chinese renminbi and the us dollar in certain of our foreign locations 
in response to greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of exposure risk management activities to minimize the potential impact on earnings 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign currency forward contracts 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the primary method we use to reduce foreign currency exposure is to identify natural hedges  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies across various subsidiaries balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  we may employ a forward contract to reduce exposure  generally expiring within one year 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
our financial instruments  which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of million and with a fair value representing a net liability position of million at december  fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of approximately million in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
the sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage global interest rate and foreign exchange exposure as part of our regular operational and financing strategies 
we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of million and million at december  and respectively 
these borrowings represented and of total outstanding debt and bore average interest rates of and at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rate applicable to these 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million as of december  we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options or swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
these contracts do not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in addition  certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market  from time to time we enter into natural gas hedge contracts with one or more major financial institutions for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and are not entered into for trading purposes 
at december  and  we had no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding
