technology products accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
our industrial products segment sells a wide array of industrial products and supplies which are marketed in north america 
most of these products are manufactured by other companies 
some products are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed on a private label basis 
industrial products accounted for   and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
the company announced plans to exit its software solutions segment in june as the result of economic conditions and difficulties in marketing the segment s products successfully 
the software solutions segment participated in the emerging market for on demand  web based business software applications through the marketing of its pcs profitcenter software application 
substantially all of the third party business activities of the software solutions segment have ended 
current and prior year results of software solutions are now included in corporate and other 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional financial information about our business segments as well as information about our geographic operations 
the company was incorporated in delaware in certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the company have been in business since our headquarters office is located at harbor park drive  port washington  new york 
products we offer hundreds of thousands of brand name and private label products 
we endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers 
products offered by our technology products segment include individual technology products in the following categories computers  computer parts  tv and video  audio  cameras and surveillance  car and gps  cell phones  software  video games and toys  home and office  and other products 
we assemble our private label pcs in our iso certified facility in fletcher  ohio 
we purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers in the united states as well as overseas 
certain parts and components for our pcs are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
we also utilize licensed technology and computer software in the assembly of our pcs 
for a discussion of risks associated with these licenses and suppliers  see item a  risk factors 
products offered by our industrial products segment include individual industrial products in the following categories material handling  storage and shelving  workbench shop desks  packaging and supplies  furniture and office  foodservice and appliances  janitorial and maintenance  tools and instruments  fasteners and hardware  motors and power transmission  hvac r and fans  electrical and bulbs  plumbing supplies  and safety and medical items 
sales and marketing we market our products to both individual consumers and business customers 
our business customers include for profit businesses  educational organizations and government entities 
we have developed numerous proprietary customer and prospect databases 
to reach our individual consumer customers  we use online methods such as website campaigns  banner ads and e mail campaigns 
we are able to monitor and evaluate the results of our various advertising campaigns to enable us to execute them in the most cost effective manner 
we combine our use of e commerce initiatives with catalog mailings  which generate online orders and calls to inbound sales representatives 
these sales representatives use our information and distribution systems to fulfill orders and explore additional customer product needs 
sales to individual consumers are generally fulfilled from our own stock  requiring us to carry more inventory than we would for our business customers 
we also periodically take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases with the objective of turning them quickly into sales 
we have also successfully increased our sales to individual consumers by using retail outlet stores 
over the past several years  the company has expanded its brick and mortar retail operations through the compusa acquisition and by opening new stores 

table of contents we have established a multi faceted direct marketing system to business customers  consisting primarily of our relationship marketers  catalog mailings and proprietary internet websites  the combination of which is designed to maximize sales 
our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a systemax account manager 
the goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers 
with access to the records we maintain  our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values 
in certain countries  we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange edi ordering and customized billing services  customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers 
our relationship marketers efforts are supported by frequent catalog mailings and e mail campaigns  both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales  and our interactive websites  which allow customers to purchase products directly over the internet 
we believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business  educational and government customer base 
we believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales  just as we believe catalog mailings and email campaigns which feature our websites results in greater internet related sales 
e commerce the worldwide growth in active internet users has made e commerce a significant opportunity for sales growth 
the increase in our internet related sales enables us to leverage our advertising spending 
we currently operate multiple e commerce sites  including north america europe www

com we are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites 
our internet sites feature on line catalogs of hundreds of thousands of products  allowing us to offer a wider variety of computer and industrial products than our printed catalogs 
our customers have around the clock  on line access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers interests 
many of our internet sites also permit customers to purchase build to order pcs configured to their own specifications 
in addition to our own e commerce websites  we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide click throughs from their sites directly to ours 
these arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost 
catalogs we currently produce a total of full line or direct mail publications in north america and europe under distinct titles 
our portfolio of catalogs includes such established brand names as tigerdirect 
com  global computer supplies  tigerdirect 
ca  misco  global industrial  nexel and inmac wstore 
we mail catalogs to both businesses and individual consumers 
in the case of business mailings  we mail our catalogs to many individuals at a single business location  providing us with multiple points of contact 
our in house staff designs all of our catalogs  which reduces overall catalog expense and shortens catalog production time 
our catalogs are printed by third parties under fixed pricing arrangements 
the commonality of certain core pages of our catalogs also allows for economies of scale in catalog production 
continuing our focus on internet advertising  the distribution of our catalogs decreased to million in  which was less than in the prior year 
in  we mailed approximately million catalogs in north america  a decrease from last year and approximately million catalogs in europe  or fewer than mailed in 
table of contents customer service  order fulfillment and support we receive orders through the internet  by telephone  electronic data interchange and by fax 
we generally provide toll free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary 
certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service 
certain of our products are carried in stock  and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our distribution centers  typically within one day of the order 
we utilize numerous sales and distribution facilities in north america and europe 
orders are generally shipped by third party delivery services 
we maintain relationships with a number of large distributors in north america and europe that also deliver products directly to our customers 
we provide extensive technical telephone support to our private label pc customers 
we maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives  enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions 
we conduct regular on site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings 
suppliers we purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors 
in  one vendor accounted for of our purchases 
one vendor accounted for of our purchases in  and in one vendor accounted for and another vendor accounted for of our purchases 
the loss of these vendors  or any other key vendors  could have a material adverse effect on us 
most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications 
competition and other market factors technology products the north american and european technology product markets are highly competitive  with many us  asian and european companies vying for market share 
there are few barriers to entry  with these products being sold through multiple channels of distribution  including direct marketers  local and national retail computer stores  computer resellers  mass merchants  over the internet and by computer and office supply superstores 
timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive 
other competitive factors include product performance  quality and reliability  technical support and customer service  marketing and distribution and price 
some of our competitors have stronger brand recognition  broader product lines and greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
conditions in the market for technology products remain highly competitive characterized by prevalent discounting of product sales price as well as free or highly discounted freight offerings to our customers 
these actions have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long term sales growth and profitability 
there is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue 
current economic conditions raise additional factors as the loss of consumer confidence in the company s markets could result in a decrease of spending in the categories of products we sell 
it is also possible that as manufacturers react to the marketplace they may reduce manufacturing capacity and create shortages of product 
industrial products the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers  large warehouse stores and retail outlets 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
many high volume purchasers  however  utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe that direct marketing via sales representatives  catalog and the internet are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach mid sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products 
in addition  because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented  it is well suited to private label products 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed a total of approximately  employees  of whom  were in north america and  were in europe and asia 
seasonality as the company s consumer channel sales have grown significantly in the past few years  the fourth quarter has represented a greater portion of annual sales than historically 
net sales have historically been modestly weaker during the second and third quarters as a result of lower business activity during those months 
see item  management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
environmental matters under various national  state and local environmental laws and regulations in north america and western europe  a current or previous owner or operator including the lessee of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we lease most of our facilities 
in connection with such leases  we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances 
although we have not been notified of  and are not otherwise aware of  any material real property environmental liability  claim or non compliance  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations we currently sell our products in north america the united states  puerto rico and canada and europe

item a 
risk factors 
there are a number of factors and variables described below that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
other factors of which we are currently not aware or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial position 
risks related to the economy and our industries general economic conditions  such as decreased consumer confidence and spending  reductions in manufacturing capacity  and inflation could result in our failure to achieve our historical sales growth rates and profit levels 
current economic conditions may cause the loss of consumer confidence in the company s markets which may result in a decrease of spending in the categories of products we sell 
with conditions in the market for technology products remaining highly competitive  reductions in our selling prices  as we have experienced in recent years  would adversely affect our revenues and profits 
it is also possible that as manufacturers react to the marketplace they may reduce manufacturing capacity or allocations to their customers creating shortages of product 
both we and our customers are subject to global political  economic and market conditions  including inflation  interest rates  energy costs  the impact of natural disasters  military action and the threat of terrorism 
our consolidated results of operations are directly affected by economic conditions in north america and europe 
we may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
our results of operations depend upon  among other things  our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  our ability to limit price reductions and maintain our margins  our ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of our customers 
a decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers  causing them to limit or defer their spending  would likely adversely affect our sales  prices and profitability as well 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
these initiatives  as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions  may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to continue to achieve the growth rates and levels of profitability we have recently experienced 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
the markets for our products and services are extremely competitive and if we are unable to successfully respond to our competitors strategies our sales and gross margins will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
we expect this competition to further intensify in the future 
competitive factors include price  availability  service and support 
we compete with a wide variety of other resellers and retailers  including internet marketers  as well as manufacturers 
many of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers  large warehouse stores and retail outlets 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives  resulting in our inability to increase our revenues or maintain our gross margins in the future 

table of contents in most cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could decrease 
our gross margins are also dependent on the mix of products we sell and could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers shift to lower priced products 
sales tax laws may be changed which could result in ecommerce and direct mail retailers having to collect sales taxes in states where the current laws do not require us to do so 
this could reduce demand for our products in such states and could result in us having substantial tax liabilities for past sales 
our united states subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe nexus exists which obligates us to collect sales tax 
other states may  from time to time  claim that we have state related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require such collection 
additionally  many other states seek to impose sales tax collection or reporting obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state  or directly to the state and its political subdivisions  even without a physical presence 
such efforts by states have increased recently  as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the tax burden on residents 
we rely on united states supreme court decisions which hold that  without congressional authority  a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier 
we cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection or reporting obligations on all e commerce and or direct mail transactions 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales and would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us and may reduce demand for our products from customers in such states when we charge customers for such taxes 
events such as acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  changes in law  or large losses could adversely affect our insurance coverage and insurance expense  resulting in an adverse affect on our profitability and financial condition 
we insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  worker s compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as acts of war and terrorism  economic conditions  judicial decisions  legislation  natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
changes in accounting standards or practices  as well as new accounting pronouncements or interpretations  may require us to account for and report our financial results in a different manner in the future  which may be less favorable than the manner used historically 
a change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
risks related to our company we rely to a great extent on our information and telecommunications systems  and significant system failures or outages  or our failure to properly evaluate  upgrade or replace our systems  or the failure of our security safety measures to protect our systems and websites  could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
we rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems in our operations 
our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems  including our telecommunications systems 
to manage our growth  we continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing systems and procedures 
we anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems  including software and hardware  as we grow and the needs of our business change 
in particular  our primary financial system is being replaced currently 
the occurrence of a significant system failure  electrical or telecommunications outages or our failure to expand or successfully implement new systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our information systems networks  including our websites  and applications could be adversely affected by viruses or worms and may be vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking 
the availability and efficiency of sales via our websites could also be adversely affected by denial of service attacks and other unfair competitive practices 
although we take preventive measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we rely on third party suppliers for most of our products and services 
the loss or interruption of these relationships could impact our sales volumes  the levels of inventory we must carry  and or result in sales delays and or higher inventory costs from new suppliers 
coop advertising and other sales incentives provided by our suppliers could decrease in the future thereby increasing our expenses and adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase substantially all of our technology products from major distributors and directly from large manufacturers who may deliver those products directly to our customers 
these relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintain large amounts of inventory 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business 
we purchase a number of our products from vendors outside of the united states 
difficulties encountered by one or several of these suppliers could halt or disrupt production and delay completion or cause the cancellation of our orders 
delays or interruptions in the transportation network could result in loss or delay of timely receipt of product required to fulfill customer orders 
our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability  merchandise quality issues  product safety concerns  trade restrictions  work stoppages  tariffs  foreign currency exchange rates  transportation capacity and costs  inflation  civil unrest  outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 
these and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit 
our pc products contain electronic components  subassemblies and software that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers  some of which are located outside of the us although we do not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there is no assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
any loss of  or interruption of  supply from key suppliers may require us to find new suppliers 
this could result in production or development delays while new suppliers are located  which could substantially impair operating results 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components were to increase significantly  operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
many product suppliers provide us with coop advertising support in exchange for featuring their products in our catalogs and on our internet sites 
certain suppliers provide us with other incentives such as rebates  reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection and other similar arrangements 
these incentives are offset against cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses  as applicable 
the level of coop advertising support and other incentives received from suppliers may decline in the future  which could increase our cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired resulting in a charge to earnings 
the acquisition of certain assets of compusa  circuitcity and the purchase of the stock of wstore europe sa resulted in the recording of significant intangible assets and or goodwill 
we are required to test goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if the carrying values of these assets are impaired or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment exist 
if any of our goodwill or intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period during which the impairment is discovered 
our substantial international operations are subject to risks such as fluctuations in currency rates which can adversely impact foreign revenues and profits when translated to us dollars  foreign regulatory requirements  political uncertainty and the management of our growing international operations 
we operate internationally and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
risks inherent to operating overseas include changes in a country s economic or political conditions changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
table of contents difficulties with staffing and managing international operations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for example  we currently have operations located in numerous countries outside the united states  and non us sales europe  canada and puerto rico accounted for approximately of our revenue during to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into us dollars 
we are exposed to various inventory risks  such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and or the loss of product return rights and price protection from our vendors  such events could lower our gross margins or result in inventory write downs that would reduce reported future earnings 
our inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products 
if we fail to manage our inventory of older products we may have excess or obsolete inventory 
we may have limited rights to return products to certain suppliers and we may not be able to obtain price protection on these items 
the elimination of product return privileges and lack of availability of price protection could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write downs 
we also take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases  any resulting excess and or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any inability to make such bulk inventory purchases may significantly impact our sales and profitability 
if we fail to observe certain restrictions and covenants under our credit facilities the lenders could refuse to waive such default  terminate the credit facility and demand immediate repayment  which would adversely affect our cash position and materially adversely affect our operations 
our united states revolving credit agreement contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to  among other things incur additional debt create or permit liens on assets make capital expenditures or investments pay dividends if we fail to comply with the covenants and other requirements set forth in the credit agreement  we would be in default and would need to negotiate a waiver agreement with the lenders 
failure to agree on such a waiver could result in the lenders terminating the credit agreement and demanding repayment of any outstanding borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash position and adversely affect the availability of financing to us  which could materially impact our operations 
we depend on bank credit facilities to address our working capital and cash flow needs from time to time  and if we are unable to renew or replace these facilities  or borrowing capacity were to be reduced our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
we require significant levels of capital in our business to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain credit facilities in the united states and in europe to finance increases in our working capital if available cash is insufficient 
the amount of credit available to us at any point in time may be adversely affected by the quality or value of the assets collateralizing these credit lines 
in addition  in recent years global financial markets have experienced diminished liquidity and lending constraints 
our ability to obtain future and or increased financing to satisfy our requirements as our business expands could be adversely affected by economic and market conditions  credit availability and lender perception of our company and industry 
however  we currently have no reason to believe that we will not be able to renew or replace our facilities when they reach maturity 
we have experienced rapid growth in retail stores in north america and to maintain their profitability we must effectively manage our growth and cost structure  such as inventory needs  point of sales systems  personnel and lease expense 
we have retail stores operating in north america at december  and one under construction 
the company needs to effectively manage its cost structure in order to maintain profitability including the additional inventory needs  retail point of sales it systems  retail personnel and leased facilities 
future growth in retail will also be dependent on the ability to attract customers and build brand loyalty 
the retail computer and consumer electronics business is highly competitive and has narrow gross margins 
if we fail to manage our growth and cost structure while maintaining high levels of service and meeting competitive pressures adequately  our business plan may not be achieved and may lead to reduced profitability 

table of contents the failure to timely and satisfactorily process manufacturers and our own rebate programs could negatively impact our customer satisfaction levels 
similar to other companies in the technology products industry  we advertise manufacturers mail in rebates on many products we sell and  in some cases  offer our own rebates 
these rebates are processed through third party vendors and in house 
if these rebates are not processed in a timely and satisfactory manner by either third party vendors or our in house operations  our reputation in the marketplace could be negatively impacted 
we may be unable to reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressures  or implement cost reductions or new product line expansion to address gross profit and operating margin pressures  failure to mitigate these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the computer and consumer electronics industry is highly price competitive and gross profit margins are narrow and variable 
the company s ability to further reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressure is limited 
timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive 
additionally  gross margins and operating margins are affected by changes in factors such as vendor pricing  vendor rebate and or price protection programs  product return rights  and product mix 
in pricing pressure continued to be prevalent in the markets we serve and we expect this to continue 
we may not be able to mitigate these pricing pressures and resultant declines in sales and gross profit margin with cost reductions in other areas or expansion into new product lines 
if we are unable to proportionately mitigate these conditions our operating results and financial condition may suffer 
we would be exposed to liability  including substantial fines and penalties and  in extreme cases  loss of our ability to accept credit cards  in the event our privacy and data security policies and procedures are inadequate to prevent security breaches of our consumer personal information and credit card information records 
in processing our sales orders we often collect personal information and credit card information from our customers 
the company has privacy and data security policies in place which are designed to prevent security breaches  however  if a third party or a rogue employee or employees are able to bypass our network security or otherwise compromise our customers personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability 
this liability may include claims for identity theft  unauthorized purchases and claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices or other related claims 
while the company believes it is in compliance with appropriate payment card industry pci security standards for its various businesses  any breach involving the loss of credit card information may lead to pci related fines of up to  in the event of a severe breach credit card providers may prevent the accepting of credit cards 
any such liability related to the aforementioned risks could lead to reduced profitability and damage our brand s and or reputation 
failure to protect the integrity  security and use of our customers information could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers the use of individually identifiable consumer data is regulated at the state  federal and international levels and we incur costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws 
additionally  our internet operations and website sales depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including the use of cashless payments 
while we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information  there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data 
if any such compromise of our security were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial condition and could subject us to litigation 
sales to individual customers expose us to credit card fraud  which impacts our operations 
if we fail to adequately protect ourselves from credit card fraud  our operations could be adversely impacted 
failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could increase our expenses 
increased sales to individual consumers  which are more likely to be paid for using a credit card  increases our exposure to fraud 
we employ technology solutions to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information 
however  if we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud  we may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  which could adversely affect our business 
our business is dependent on certain key personnel

audit committee investigation and gilbert fiorentino s resignation and settlement and related matters 
in january and february the company received anonymous whistleblower allegations concerning the company s miami florida operations involving the actions of mr 
gilbert fiorentino  then the chief executive of the company s technology products group 
in response to the allegations  the company commenced an internal investigation of the whistleblower allegations  which was conducted by the company s audit committee of the board of directors with the assistance of independent counsel 
on april   following the independent investigation  the company delivered a cause notice to mr 
fiorentino pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement dated october  the cause notice advised mr 
fiorentino that the company intended to terminate him for cause as defined in the employment agreement at a meeting of its executive committee scheduled for may   at which meeting mr 
fiorentino and his counsel could appear  and that mr 
fiorentino was being placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of that meeting 
in the cause notice  the company advised mr 
fiorentino that the audit committee investigation had identified grounds to terminate him for cause under his employment agreement  and set forth the following findings by the audit committee constituting such grounds i mr 
fiorentino personally removed or caused to be removed from the company s miami premises product inventory  and or kept or caused others to receive at his direction such removed product inventory  without payment to the company and for his own personal gain  ii mr 
fiorentino caused substantial amounts of company inventory purchases to be effected through company credit cards in order to accrue and or use reward points for his personal benefit and which he improperly converted to his own use  iii mr 
fiorentino caused his mother to be identified as an employee of the company in positions for which she had no bona fide job responsibility or function  and caused the company to pay her a salary and employee benefits  including extended cobra reimbursements  and iv mr 
fiorentino engaged in fraudulent kickback arrangements with certain of the company s vendors  to the detriment of the company the company stated in the cause notice that the foregoing activities were in violation of company policy  the company s corporate ethics policy  his fiduciary duties and applicable law 
the amounts involved in the employment of mr 
fiorentino s mother are small in absolute terms 
the inventory removal constitutes a shortage that is not material for a company the size of systemax 
the credit card reward points scheme involved the creation  and conversion  of non monetary assets 
the finding involving the vendor overcharge kickback allegations is not material when compared to the company s total inventory spend during the subject period 
the audit committee s independent investigation determined that the matters described above did not have any material impact on our previously reported financial results and were limited to the company s miami operations 

table of contents on may   following several meetings of the executive committee and after extensive discussions with mr 
fiorentino and his counsel  the company announced that it had accepted the resignation of mr 
fiorentino  and that it had executed an agreement with mr

fiorentino to disclose his and his immediate family s personal assets  forfeit undisclosed assets discovered by the company  disclose information regarding certain matters that led to his being notified of the company s intent to terminate him  and to fully cooperate with the company in the future 
mr 
fiorentino and the company also exchanged mutual general releases and nondisparagement commitments  and mr 
fiorentino agreed to a year noncompetition obligation 
the million settlement value included a financial statement benefit to the company related to the surrender of shares and cash payment of approximately million which was recorded in the second quarter of under special gains charges  net of related legal and professional fees of approximately million for the quarter ended june  and million for the first six months of the remainder of the settlement value  approximately million  was the intrinsic value of the fully vested unexercised stock options on the date of the settlement agreement for which there is no financial statement impact 
the amount of the settlement with mr 
fiorentino was based on negotiation with him  and was not based on any specific level or nature of damages incurred by the company  and does not constitute restitution

overview systemax is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label products 
our operations are organized in two reportable business segments technology products and industrial products 
our technology products segment sells computers  computer supplies and consumer electronics which are marketed in north america  puerto rico and europe 
most of these products are manufactured by other companies  however  we do offer a selection of products that are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed on a private label basis 
technology products accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
our industrial products segment sells a wide array of industrial products and supplies which are marketed in north america 
most of these products are manufactured by other companies 
some products are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed under the trademarks global  globalindustrial 
com and nexel 
industrial products accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
in both of these product groups  we offer our customers a broad selection of products  prompt order fulfillment and extensive customer service 
we announced plans to exit the software solutions segment during the second quarter of substantially all of the third party business activities of profitcenter software have ended 
current and prior year results for software solutions are now included in corporate and other 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional financial information about our business segments as well as information about our geographic operations 
the market for computer products and consumer electronics is subject to intense price competition and is characterized by narrow gross profit margins 
the north american industrial products market is highly fragmented and we compete against companies utilizing multiple distribution channels 
distribution is working capital intensive  requiring us to incur significant costs associated with the warehousing of many products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and inventory management systems  and employing personnel to perform the associated tasks 
we supplement our on hand product availability by maintaining relationships with major distributors and manufacturers  utilizing a combination of stocking and drop shipment fulfillment 
the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs  which includes items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  employee benefits and stock option expenses 
we continually assess our operations to ensure that they are efficient  aligned with market conditions and responsive to customer needs 

table of contents in the discussion of our results of operations we refer to business to business sales  consumer channel sales and period to period constant currency comparisons 
business to business sales are sales made direct to other businesses through managed business relationships  outbound call centers and extranets 
sales in the industrial products segment and corporate and other are considered to be business to business sales 
consumer channel sales are sales from retail stores  consumer websites  inbound call centers and television shopping channels 
constant currency refers to the adjustment of the results of our foreign operations to exclude the effects of period to period fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as a result  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
we identify below a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates  the assumptions and or judgments used to determine those estimates and the potential effects on reported financial results if actual results differ materially from these estimates 
accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales when persuasive evidence of an order arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of receipt by customers when title and risk of loss both are transferred 
sales are presented net of returns and allowances  rebates and sales incentives 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded  based on historical experience and current trends 
our revenue recognition policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to the timing and amounts of future sales returns 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical experience and current known trends 
we have not made any material changes to our sales return reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same allowance rate we have in the past 
our allowance for doubtful accounts policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to collectibility of aged accounts receivable and chargebacks from credit card sales 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of the age of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis also includes the financial condition of a specific customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where we are aware of customer credit card charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
we have not made any material changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve at december  would impact net income by approximately million 

table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method except in europe and retail locations where an average cost is used 
excess and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are written down based on historical experience  assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if market conditions are less favorable than projected or if technological developments result in accelerated obsolescence  additional write downs may be required 
while obsolescence and resultant markdowns have been within expectations  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same level of markdowns we have in the past 
our inventory reserve policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to inventory aging  obsolescence  credits that we may obtain for returned merchandise  shrink and consumer demand 
we have not made any material changes to our inventory reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material loss adjustment 
a change of in our inventory reserves at december  would impact net income by approximately million 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we apply the provisions of relevant accounting guidance in our valuation of goodwill  trademarks  domain names  client lists and other intangible assets 
relevant accounting guidance requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles be reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our impairment testing involves judgments and uncertainties  quantitative and qualitative  related to the use of discounted cash flow models and forecasts of future results  both of which involve significant judgment and may not be reliable 
significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the operating environment and economic conditions that exist to develop a forecast for a reporting unit 
assumptions related to the discounted cash flow models we use include the inputs used to determine the company s weighted average cost of capital including a market risk premium  the beta of a reporting unit  reporting unit specific risk premiums and terminal growth values 
critical assumptions related to the forecast inputs used in our discounted cash flow models include projected sales growth  same store sales growth  gross margin percentages  new business opportunities  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and growth in selling  general and administrative expense 
we also use our company s market capitalization and comparable company market data to validate our reporting unit valuations 
we have not made any material changes to our goodwill and intangible assets policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine whether any of our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired will change materially in the future 
however if the inputs used in our discounted cash flow models or our forecasts are materially different than actual experience we could incur impairment charges that are material 
the company has approximately million in goodwill and intangible assets at december  in no impairment of the company s goodwill or intangible assets were identified 

table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment and in their depreciation and amortization methods and lives 
we believe we will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment 
the impairment analysis for long lived assets requires management to make judgments about useful lives and to estimate fair values of long lived assets 
it may also require us to estimate future cash flows of related assets using discounted cash flow model our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and assumptions used to determine long lived asset impairment will vary materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
an change of in the carrying value of our long lived assets would impact net income by approximately million 
vendor accruals 
our contractual agreements with certain suppliers provide us with funding or allowances for costs such as price protection  markdowns and advertising as well as funds or allowances for purchasing volumes 
generally  allowances received as a reimbursement of identifiable costs are recorded as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred 
sales related allowances are generally determined by our level of purchases of product and are deferred and recorded as a reduction of inventory carrying value and are ultimately included as a reduction of cost of goods when inventory is sold 
management makes assumptions and exercises judgment in estimating period end funding and allowances earned under our various agreements 
estimates are developed based on the terms of our vendor agreements and using existing expenditures for which funding is available  determining products whose market price would indicate coverage for markdown or price protection is available and estimating the level of our performance under agreements that provide funds or allowances for purchasing volumes 
estimates of funding or allowances for purchasing volume will include projections of annual purchases which are developed using current actual purchase data and historical purchase trends 
accruals in interim periods could be materially different if actual purchase volumes differ from projections 
we have not made any material changes to our vendor accrual policy in the past three years nor do we anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
if actual results are different from the projections used we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in our vendor accruals at december  would impact net income by approximately million 

table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially income taxes 
we are subject to taxation from federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and the determination of our tax provision is complex and requires significant management judgment 
we conduct operations in numerous us states and foreign locations 
our effective tax rate depends upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax income or losses among locations with varying tax rates and rules 
as the geographic mix of our pre tax results among various tax jurisdictions changes  the effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
we are also subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we establish as needed  and periodically reevaluate  an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while management believes that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and whether or not a reserve is appropriate  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be necessary requires management to make significant judgments concerning the ability to realize net deferred tax assets 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income there are judgments and uncertainties related to the development of forecasts of future results that may not be reliable 
significant management judgment is also necessary to evaluate the operating environment and economic conditions that exist to develop a forecast for a reporting unit 
where management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized  we have provided a valuation allowance 
if the realization of those deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
we have not made any material changes to our income tax policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances will change materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in our effective tax rate at december  would impact net income by approximately million 
reorganization and other charges 
we have recorded reorganization  restructuring and other charges in the past and could in the future commence further reorganization  restructuring and other activities which result in recognition of charges to income 
the recording of reorganization  restructuring and other charges may involve assumptions and judgments about future costs and timing for amounts related to personnel terminations  stay bonuses  lease termination costs  lease sublet revenues  outplacement services  contract termination costs  asset impairments and other exit costs 
management may estimate these costs using existing contractual and other data or may rely on third party expert data 
when we incur a liability related to these actions  we estimate and record all appropriate expenses 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine our reorganization  restructuring and other charges will change materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
for the year ended december  the company did not have any amounts accrued for reorganization  restructuring and other charges 

table of contents recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements public companies in the united states are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of various authorities  including the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission sec 
these authorities issue numerous pronouncements  most of which are not applicable to the company s current or reasonably foreseeable operating structure 
below are the new authoritative pronouncements that management believes are relevant to the company s current operations 
in  the fasb issued guidance which provides companies with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing updated qualitative factors  a company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not have to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test 
the company adopted this guidance in october the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance related to comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires the presentation of items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
presentation of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity is no longer allowed under the amended guidance 
the amended guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that updates existing disclosure requirements related to supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
under the updated guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance became effective for the company on january  and will be applied prospectively to business combinations that have an acquisition date on or after january  highlights from the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition that follows will provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements and information about how certain accounting principles and estimates affect the consolidated financial statements

gross margin the consolidated gross margin increase in is due to changes in the segment and channel mix  with industrial products sales  which are typically higher margin than technology products  contributing a larger percentage to gross profit dollars 
modest improvements in our freight margin in technology products contributed to the improved margin from our ongoing freight and logistics initiatives 
gross margin is dependent on variables such as product mix  vendor price protection and other sales incentives  competition  pricing strategy  cooperative advertising funds required to be classified as a reduction to cost of sales  freight discounting and other variables  any or all of which may result in fluctuations in gross margin

our earnings and cash flows are seasonal in nature  with the fourth quarter of the fiscal year generating higher earnings and cash flows than the other quarters 
levels of earnings and cash flows are dependent on factors such as consolidated gross margin and selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales  product mix and relative levels of domestic and foreign sales 
unusual gains or expense items  such as special gains charges and settlements  may impact earnings and are separately disclosed 
we expect that past performance may not be indicative of future performance due to the competitive nature of our technology products segment where the need to adjust prices to gain or hold market share is prevalent 
macroeconomic conditions  such as business and consumer sentiment  may affect our revenues  cash flows or financial condition 
however  we do not believe that there is a direct correlation between any specific macroeconomic indicator and our revenues  cash flows or financial condition 
we are not currently interest rate sensitive  as we have significant cash balances and minimal debt 
we anticipate cash needs to support our growth and expansion plans  continued investment in upgrading and expanding our technological capabilities and information technology infrastructure  opening of new retail stores  and in building out and expanding our distribution center facilities and inventory systems

over the past several years we have engaged in opportunistic acquisitions  choosing to pay the purchase price in cash  and may do so in the future as favorable situations arise 
however  a deep and prolonged period of reduced consumer and or business to business spending could adversely impact our cash resources and force us to either forego future acquisition opportunities or to pay the purchase price in shares of our common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
in addition we anticipate cash needs for implementation of the financial systems 
we believe that our cash balances  future cash flows from operations and our availability under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of december   all of our investments had maturities of less than three months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for the rental of most of our facilities and certain of our equipment which expire at various dates through we have sublease agreements for unused space we lease in uniondale  new york

tax contingencies are related to uncertain tax positions taken on income tax returns that may result in additional tax  interest and penalties being paid to taxing authorities 
as of december   the company had no uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates principally pounds sterling  euros and canadian dollars as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the translation of the financial statements of our operations located outside of the united states is impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect income statement  balance sheet and cash flows as expressed in us dollars
