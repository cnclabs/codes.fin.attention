our company s operations are organized according to product category and geographic location us iron ore  eastern canadian iron ore  north american coal  asia pacific iron ore  asia pacific coal  latin american iron ore  ferroalloys  and our global exploration group 
we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the world s largest and fastest growing steel markets 
in the us we operate five iron ore mines in michigan and minnesota  five metallurgical coal mines located in west virginia and alabama and one thermal coal mine located in west virginia 
we also operate two iron ore mines in eastern canada that provide iron ore to the seaborne market for asian steel producers 
our asia pacific operations primarily are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in western australia  serving the asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore  and a percent economic interest in a coking and thermal coal mine located in queensland  australia 
in latin america  we have a percent interest in amap  a brazilian iron ore operation  and in ontario  canada  we have a major chromite project in the pre feasibility stage of exploration 
in addition  our global exploration group is focused on early involvement in exploration activities to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
our results were driven by increased steel production  higher demand and rising prices 
global crude steel production  the primary driver of our business  was up approximately five percent from this included increases of approximately nine and seven percent in china and the us  respectively  which are the two largest markets for the company 
china produced approximately million metric tons of crude steel in  representing approximately percent of global production 
the world price of iron ore is influenced heavily by international demand  and rising spot market prices for iron ore has reflected this trend 
our consolidated revenues for increased to billion  with net income from continuing operations per diluted share of 
this compares with revenues of billion and net income from continuing operations per diluted share of in based upon the recent shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market and away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism historically referenced in our customer supply agreements  pricing has continued to increase during compared to we have finalized short term pricing arrangements with our asia pacific iron ore customers and we have reached final pricing settlements with the majority of our us iron ore customers for the contract year 
however  in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing 
in addition  in april  we reached a negotiated settlement with arcelormittal usa with respect to our previously disclosed arbitrations and litigation resulting in additional revenue recorded in revenues during were also impacted by higher iron ore sales volumes in eastern canada and higher metallurgical and thermal coal sales volumes in the us that were made available through our acquisition of consolidated thompson and clcc during the second quarter of and the third quarter of  respectively 
in asia pacific  the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout primarily led by demand from china 
results in reflect strong performance at our operations around the world and improved pricing for our products

through our acquisition of consolidated thompson  we now own and operate an iron ore mine and processing facility near bloom lake in quebec  canada that produces high quality iron ore concentrate 
wisco is a percent partner in bloom lake 
the initial design of bloom lake operations is to achieve a production rate of million metric tons of iron ore concentrate per year 
additional capital investments were approved by our board of directors in january in order to increase the initial production rate to million metric tons of iron ore concentrate per year 
we also own two additional development properties  lam l e and peppler lake  in quebec 
all three of these properties are in proximity to our existing canadian operations and will allow us to leverage our port facilities and supply this iron ore to the seaborne market 
the acquisition also is expected to further diversify our existing customer base 
in addition to the integration of consolidated thompson  we have a number of capital projects underway in all of our reportable business segments 
we believe these projects will continue to improve our operational performance  diversify our customer base and extend the reserve life of our portfolio of assets  all of which are necessary to sustain continued growth 
throughout  we also will reinforce our global reorganization  as our leadership moves to an integrated global management structure 
we also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration and development activities by partnering with junior mining companies  which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions

eastern canadian iron ore sold million metric tons during compared with million metric tons during this increase in sales volume is attributable directly to million metric tons of additional sales due to the acquisition of consolidated thompson  resulting in million of additional revenue for in addition  sales volumes at wabush resulted in million of additional revenue over driven largely by increases in demand and the timing of our acquisition of the remaining interest in wabush during february the increase in revenue is also a result of improvement in sales price  which caused revenue to increase million over the comparable prior year period 
our realized sales price for over was on average a nine percent increase per metric ton  due to higher prices for iron ore due to worldwide demand 
the increase in revenue was offset partially by increases in cost of goods sold and operating expenses during  which increased by million primarily due to significant increase in sales volume as a result of the acquisition of consolidated thompson  resulting in million of additional cost for this includes the impact of expensing million of stepped up value inventory that resulted from the purchase accounting for the acquisition of consolidated thompson

based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken to conserve cash  we have adequate liquidity and expect to be able to fund our current business obligations from available cash  current operations and existing borrowing arrangements for the foreseeable future 
other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements 
several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary 
the bank market may provide funding through a term loan  bridge loan  revolving credit facility or through exercising the million accordion in our current credit facility or the million accordion made through our term loan 
our execution of a five year unsecured amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement that resulted in  among other things  a billion revolving credit facility in august provides evidence of funding available through the bank market 
the risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of limited capacity 
as in all debt markets  capacity is a global issue that impacts the bond market 
our issuance of a billion public offering of year and year senior notes in march and april provides evidence that capacity in the bond markets has improved and remains stable for investment grade companies compared to conditions impacting such markets in previous years 
these transactions represent the successful execution of our strategy to increase liquidity and extend debt maturities to align with longer term capital structure needs 
in addition  various capital markets may provide additional sources of funding 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases  which primarily are utilized for certain equipment and office space 
aside from these  we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
market risks we are subject to a variety of risks  including those caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we have established policies and procedures to manage such risks  however  certain risks are beyond our control 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in australia and canada  which could impact our financial condition 
with respect to australia  foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the us dollar  but the functional currency of our asia pacific operations is the australian dollar 
our asia pacific operations receive funds in us currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in australian currency 
we use forward exchange contracts  call options and collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts 
the primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in australian and us currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates 
at december   we had million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from january to december for which we elected hedge accounting  effective october we also had million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with maturity dates in january that we have been holding as economic hedges  entered into prior to october a percent increase in the value of the australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts by approximately million  and a percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately million 
we may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table represents our australian dollar foreign currency exchange contract position for contracts held as cash flow and economic hedges as of december  in millions contract maturity notional amount weighted average exchange rate spot rate fair value contract portfolio contracts expiring in the next months total hedge contract portfolio includes collar options and forward contracts 
refer to note derivative instruments and hedging activities for further information 
with respect to canada  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts and an option contract in order to hedge a portion of the consolidated thompson purchase price on the open market in the first half of the contracts were considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   these contracts all have matured 
in january  in accordance with our policy  we began to enter into canadian dollar foreign currency exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts that qualify for hedge accounting 
subsequent to december   we have entered into contracts with a notional amount of approximately c million with varying maturity dates 
the pellets produced at our wabush operations and the concentrate produced at our bloom lake operations in canada represented approximately percent of our total iron ore production in north america as of december  this operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the us and canadian 
table of contents currencies 
as of december   we did not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation  however  as discussed above  we plan to continue to enter into hedging instruments in the future to hedge such exposures 
interest rate risk interest payable on our senior notes is at fixed rates 
interest payable under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility is at a floating rate based upon the base rate or the libor rate plus a margin depending on a leverage ratio 
as of december   we had no amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term credit facility 
a basis point change to the base rate or the libor rate under the term credit facility would result in a change of approximately million to interest expense on an annual basis 
pricing risks provisional pricing arrangements during  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
such changes are likely to yield increased volatility in iron ore pricing 
this change has impacted certain of our us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customer supply agreements for the contract year 
we have reached final pricing settlements with a majority of our us iron ore customers through the end of however  in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing 
as a result  we have recorded certain shipments made to us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customers in on a provisional basis until final settlement is reached 
the pricing provisions are characterized as freestanding derivatives  which are marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period based upon the estimated forward settlement until prices actually are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined based on the forward price expectation of the final price settlement for therefore  to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
we had a derivative asset of million and a derivative liability of million  respectively  at december  related to our estimate of final pricing in with our customers representing the incremental difference between the provisional price agreed upon with our customers and our estimate of the ultimate price settlement in we also have derivatives of million classified as accounts receivable to reflect the amount we provisionally have agreed upon with our customers until a final price is reached 
we estimate that a percent change in the settlement prices realized from the december  estimated prices recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
in addition  final agreement may result in changes to the pricing mechanisms used with our various customers and could impact sales prices realized in current and future periods  which could have a material effect on our results of operations 
customer supply agreements certain supply agreements with one us iron ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
we estimate that a change in the average hot 
table of contents band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
we have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations  nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future  however  certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars  which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year 
volatile energy and fuel costs the volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs  primarily in relation to our iron ore operations 
our consolidated us iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of per mmbtu  and million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon in our consolidated eastern canadian iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon in our clcc operations consumed approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered rate of per gallon during consumption of diesel fuel by our asia pacific operations was approximately million gallons at an average delivered price of per gallon for the same period 
in the ordinary course of business  there also will be likely increases in prices relative to electrical costs at our us mine sites 
as the cost of producing electricity increases  energy companies regularly seek to reclaim those costs from the mine sites  which often results in tariff disputes 
our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels 
at the present time we have no specific plans to enter into hedging activity for and beyond and do not plan to enter into any new forward contracts for natural gas or diesel fuel in the near term 
we will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management 
assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term  a percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately million in our annual fuel and energy costs based on expected consumption for supply concentration risks many of our mines are dependent on one source each of electric power and natural gas 
a significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could impact materially our production costs  margins and profitability

recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingencies 
management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience  which are believed to be reasonable  however  due to the inherent nature of estimates  actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition us and eastern canadian iron ore provisional pricing arrangements most of our us iron ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors  some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year 
the base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract 
the inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply 
table of contents contracts and vary based on the agreement  but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices and changes in specified producers price indices  including those for all commodities  industrial commodities  energy and steel 
the pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner  with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment  although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement 
in most cases  these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold 
in these cases  we historically have estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available 
the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized 
several of our eastern canadian iron ore customers have multi year pricing arrangements that contain pricing adjustments that reference certain published market prices for iron ore 
to the extent the particular market prices are not published at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the final pricing settlement based upon the best third party information available 
similar to us iron ore  the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the published market prices are available 
during  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
these changes caused us to assess the impact a change to the historical annual pricing mechanism would have on certain of our larger existing us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customer supply agreements  and resulted in modifications to certain of our us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customer supply agreements for the contract year 
we reached final pricing settlements with a majority of our us iron ore customers through the end of for the contract year 
however  in some cases we are still working to revise components of the pricing calculations referenced within our supply agreements to incorporate new pricing mechanisms as a result of the changes to historical benchmark pricing 
as a result  we have recorded certain shipments made to our us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customers throughout the year on a provisional basis until final settlement is reached 
with respect to the us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customers for which final pricing for the contract year has not yet been settled as of december   we recorded derivative assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to our estimate of final pricing for the contract year 
this amount represents the incremental difference between the provisional prices agreed upon with our customers and our estimate of the ultimate price settlement for the contract year 
in  we reached final pricing settlement with some of our us iron ore customers through the fourth quarter of for the contract year 
with respect to the us iron ore and eastern canadian iron ore customers for which final pricing for the contract year was not settled as of december   we did not record shipments on a provisional basis due to pending arbitrations that subsequently were settled during based on the timing of the provisional pricing settlements and the quality of our estimates  adjustments of our provisional pricing estimates were not material during and the producer price indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices 
the final indices referenced in certain of the us iron ore supply contracts are typically not published by the us department of labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year 
historically  such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of percent of us iron ore s and eastern canadian iron ore s respective revenues for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended december   and us iron ore customer supply agreements in addition  certain supply agreements with one us iron ore customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnaces 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the product is shipped 
the derivative instrument  which is finalized based on a future price  is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach 
table of contents based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities  and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 
the customer s average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year  once the average annual price has been finalized 
as a result  we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year 
information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer  current spot prices  third party analyst forecasts  publications and other industry information 
the accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customer s ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year 
the following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during  and prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
asia pacific iron ore provisional pricing arrangements historically  certain supply agreements primarily with our asia pacific iron ore customers provided for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines 
as a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to the provisions  revenue reflected the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurred 
therefore  to the extent final prices were higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to revenues was recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising iron ore prices  our revenues benefited from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods  in times of falling iron ore prices  the opposite occurred 
pricing estimates primarily were based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market 
as discussed above  in  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in certain of our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
as a result  we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our chinese and japanese asia pacific iron ore customers and moved to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices  with certain pricing mechanisms that had a duration of up to a quarter 
this change was effective in the first quarter of for our chinese customers and the second quarter of for our japanese customers 
based on timing of these changes  pricing settlements were finalized with customers during each of the quarters with the exception of the first quarter of therefore  provisional pricing estimates were used during the first quarter 
table of contents of and reflected an increase of percent over settled prices for both lump and fines based on provisional quarterly index pricing 
the pricing estimates for the first quarter of reflected the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore and were based upon index pricing mechanisms previously reported in the industry 
in addition  sales to our japanese customers during the first quarter of reflected prices based upon contract years of april to march the following represents the historical accuracy of our provisional price estimates  as well as the impact on product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for the quarters during and prior to settlement 
the derivative instrument recorded during the first quarter of was settled during the second quarter of upon the move to short term pricing arrangements with asia pacific iron ore customers 
the timing of the pricing settlements for and is described further in the table below 
provisional pricing arrangements did not occur in as such  is not included within the table below

mineral reserves we regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide the estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures 
generally  as mining operations progress  haul lengths and lifts increase 
alternatively  changes in economic conditions or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves 
technological progress could alleviate such factors or increase capacity of mineral reserves 
we use our mineral reserve estimates  combined with our estimated annual production levels  to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation  a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation 
we also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets 
increases or decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items 

table of contents asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation costs the accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations 
our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider ie  inflation  overhead and profit  which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates  and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives 
the closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves  which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates also would have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
we have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration 
our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site 
if the obligation can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts  with no specific amount being more likely  the minimum of the range is accrued 
management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required 
the characteristics of environmental remediation obligations  where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements  result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature 
expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated 
potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 

table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we assign goodwill arising from acquired companies to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
our reporting units are either at the operating segment level or a component one level below our operating segments that constitutes a business for which management generally reviews production and financial results of that component 
decisions are often made as to capital expenditures  investments and production plans at the component level as part of the ongoing management of the related operating segment 
we have determined that our asia pacific iron ore and ferroalloys operating segments constitute separate reporting units  that our bloom lake and wabush mines within our eastern canadian iron ore operating segment constitute reporting units  that clcc within our north american coal operating segment constitutes a reporting unit and that our northshore mine within our us iron ore operating segment constitutes a reporting unit 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or as circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
there were no such events or changes in circumstances during as of december   the remaining value of goodwill associated with our eastern canadian iron ore  asia pacific iron ore  ferroalloys and us iron ore reporting operating segments totaled million  million  million and million  respectively 
no goodwill remains within our north american coal reporting unit as of december  we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we generally use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit must be made  including among other things  estimates related to long term price expectations  foreign currency exchange rates  expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan and life of mine estimates 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to the assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
in performing this allocation of fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  we utilize third party valuation firms to support the fair values allocated 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and  if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
if these estimates were to change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
after performing our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  we determined that million of goodwill associated with our clcc reporting unit was impaired as the carrying value within this reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the fair value was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and valuations of comparable businesses 
the impairment charge for the clcc reporting unit was driven by our overall outlook on coal pricing in light of economic conditions  increases in our anticipated costs to bring the lower war eagle mine into production and increases in our anticipated sustaining capital cost for the lives of the clcc mines that are currently operating 

table of contents no impairment charges were identified in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test with respect to our other identified reporting units 
however  a percent decrease in the fair value of our ferroalloys reporting unit could indicate the potential for an impairment of its goodwill 
with respect to the ferroalloys reporting unit  no impairment charges were taken as of december   due in part to the fact that the project within the reporting unit is still in the pre feasibility stage 
as management continues to work through the pre feasibility stage for the project  higher than anticipated capital costs and our ability to secure regulatory and environmental permitting could impact this determination 
the fair value of our bloom lake operating unit was not substantially in excess of our carrying values due to the fact that this reporting unit is comprised of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through our acquisition of consolidated thompson in therefore  our carrying values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the bloom lake operating unit were recorded at fair value through the completion of the acquisition 
these fair values are preliminary and subject to modification in the future 
a substantial decline in long term pricing expectations and higher than anticipated costs on expansion projects for bloom lake could result in future impairment indicators 
we determined that our other identified reporting units were not at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test as of december  the fair values for our asia pacific iron ore  wabush and northshore reporting units were substantially in excess of our carrying values

asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
we monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired 
in order to determine if assets have been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
an impairment loss exists when projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
fair value can be determined using a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
the impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves  future iron ore prices and production costs

employee retirement benefit obligations we offer defined benefit pension plans  defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits  to most employees in north america as part of a total compensation and benefits program

critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the medical care cost trend  and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually 
as of december  and  we used the following assumptions pension and other benefits us plan discount rate canadian pension plan discount rate canadian opeb plan discount rate rate of compensation increase us expected return on plan assets canadian expected return on plan assets additionally  on december   we adopted the irs prescribed mortality tables separate pre retirement and postretirement to determine the expected life of our plan participants  replacing the irs prescribed mortality tables for our us plans 
the assumed mortality remained the same as the previous year for our canadian plans  up with full projection
