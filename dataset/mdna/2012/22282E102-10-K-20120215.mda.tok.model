item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview growth and development 
americas segment energy from waste projects energy from waste projects have two essential purposes to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects  and to use that waste as a fuel source to generate renewable energy 
the electricity or steam generated by the projects is generally sold to local utilities or industrial customers  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the municipal clients 
these projects are capable of providing waste disposal services and generating electricity or steam  if properly operated and maintained  for several decades 
generally  we provide these waste disposal services and sell the electricity and steam generated under contracts  which expire on various dates between and many of our service contracts may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the municipal client 
our energy from waste projects generate revenue from three main sources fees charged for operating projects or processing waste received  the sale of electricity and or steam  and the sale of ferrous and non ferrous metals that are recycled as part of the energy from waste process 
we may also generate additional revenue from the construction or expansion of a facility when a municipal client owns the facility 
our customers for waste disposal or facility operations are principally municipal entities  though we also market disposal capacity at certain facilities to commercial and special waste customers 
our facilities sell energy primarily to utilities at contracted rates or  in situations where a contract is not in place  at prevailing market rates in regional markets primarily pjm  nepool and nyiso in the northeastern united states 
we also operate  and in some cases have ownership interests in  transfer stations and landfills which generate revenue from ash disposal fees or operating fees 
in addition  we own  and in some cases operate  other renewable energy projects in the americas segment which generate electricity from wood waste biomass and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these other renewable energy projects is sold to utilities under contracts or into the regional power pool at short term rates 
for these projects  we receive revenue from sales of energy  capacity and or cash from equity distributions and additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
contract structures we currently operate energy from waste projects in states and one canadian province  and are constructing an energy from waste project in a second canadian province 
most of our energy from waste projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  many of these projects have common features 
however  each service agreement is different  reflecting the specific needs and concerns of a client community  applicable regulatory requirements and or other factors 

table of contents our efw projects can generally be divided into three categories  based on the applicable contract structure at a project tip fee projects  service fee projects that we own  and service fee projects that we do not own but operate on behalf of a municipal owner 
at tip fee projects  we receive a per ton fee for processing waste  and we typically retain all of the revenue generated from energy and recycled metal sales 
we generally own or lease the tip fee facilities 
at service fee projects  we typically charge a fixed fee for operating the facility  and the facility capacity is dedicated either primarily or exclusively to the host community client  which also retains the majority of any revenue generated from energy and recycled metal sales 
as a result of these distinctions  the revenue generated at tip fee projects tends to be more dependent on operating performance  as well as market conditions  than the revenue at service fee projects 
the following summarizes the typical contractual and economic characteristics of the three project structures in the americas segment tip fee service fee owned service fee operated number of facilities client s host community and municipal and commercial waste customers host community  with limited merchant capacity in some cases dedicated to host community exclusively waste or service revenue per ton tipping fee fixed fee  with performance incentives and inflation escalation fixed fee  with performance incentives and inflation escalation energy revenue covanta retains share with client typically retain share with client typically retain metals revenue covanta retains share with client share with client operating costs covanta responsible for all operating costs pass through certain costs to municipal client eg ash disposal pass through certain costs to municipal client eg ash disposal project debt service covanta project subsidiary responsible paid explicitly as part of service fee client responsible for debt service after service contract expiration n a covanta owns the facility  clients have certain rights set forth in contracts client owns the facility  extend with covanta or tender for new contract the following describes features generally common to these agreements  as well as important distinctions among them we design the facility  help to arrange for financing and then we either construct and equip the facility on a fixed price and schedule basis  or we undertake an alternative role  such as construction management  if our municipal client so desires 
our projects were generally financed at construction with project debt in the form of tax exempt municipal bonds issued by a sponsoring municipality  which generally mature at the same time the initial term of our service contract expires and are repaid over time based on set amortization schedules 
at tip fee facilities  our project subsidiary is responsible for meeting any debt service or lease payment obligations out of the revenue generated by the facility 
at service fee projects that we own and where project debt is in place  a portion of our monthly fee from the municipal client is dedicated  dollar for dollar  to project debt service 
for these facilities  the bond proceeds are loaned to us to pay for facility construction and to fund a debt service reserve for the project  which is generally sufficient to pay principal and interest for one year 
project related debt is included as project debt and the debt service reserves are included as restricted funds held in trust in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  project debt is secured by the project s revenue  contracts and other assets of our project subsidiary 
when the service contract expires and the debt is paid off  the project owner either covanta or the municipal entity will determine the form of any new contractual arrangements 
we are not responsible for debt service for projects that we neither own nor lease 
following construction and during operations  we receive revenue from two primary sources fees we receive for operating and maintaining projects or for processing waste received  and payments we receive for electricity and or steam we sell 
we agree to operate the facility and meet minimum waste processing capacity and efficiency standards  energy production levels and environmental standards 
failure to meet these requirements or satisfy the other material terms of our agreement unless the failure is caused by our client community or by events beyond our control  may result in damages charged to us or  if the breach is substantial  continuing and unremedied  termination of the applicable agreement 
these damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt as reduced by amounts held in trust and or proceeds from sales of facilities securing project debt and as such  these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified 
we have issued performance guarantees to our client communities and  in some cases other parties  which guarantee that our project subsidiaries will perform in accordance with 
table of contents contractual terms including  where required  the payment of such damages 
if one or more contracts were terminated for our default  these contractual damages may be material to our cash flow and financial condition 
to date  we have not incurred material liabilities under such performance guarantees 
the client community generally must deliver minimum quantities of municipal solid waste to the facility on a put or pay basis and is obligated to pay a fee for its disposal 
a put or pay commitment means that the client community promises to deliver a stated quantity of waste and pay an agreed amount for its disposal  regardless of whether the full amount of waste is actually delivered 
client communities have consistently met their commitment to deliver the stated quantity of waste 
where a service fee structure exists  portions of the service fee escalate to reflect indices for inflation  and in many cases  the client community must also pay for other costs  such as insurance  taxes  and transportation and disposal of the ash residue to the disposal site 
generally  expenses resulting from the delivery of unacceptable and hazardous waste on the site are also borne by the client community 
in addition  the contracts generally require the client community to pay increased expenses and capital costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances  subject to specified limits 
at three publicly owned facilities we operate  our client community may terminate the operating contract under certain circumstances without cause 
our financial returns are expected to be stable if we do not incur material unexpected operation and maintenance costs or other expenses 
in addition  most of our energy from waste project contracts are structured so that contract counterparties generally bear  or share in  the costs associated with events or circumstances not within our control  such as uninsured force majeure events and changes in legal requirements 
the stability of our revenues and returns could be affected by our ability to continue to enforce these obligations 
also  at some of our energy from waste facilities  commodity price risk is mitigated by passing through commodity costs to contract counterparties 
with respect to our other renewable energy projects  such structural features generally do not exist because either we operate and maintain such facilities for our own account or we do so on a cost plus basis rather than a fixed fee basis 
we receive the majority of our revenue under short and long term contracts  with little or no exposure to price volatility  but with adjustments intended to reflect changes in our costs 
where our revenue is received under other arrangements and depending upon the revenue source  we have varying amounts of exposure to price volatility 
the largest component of our revenue is waste revenue  which has generally been subject to less price volatility than our revenue derived from the sale of energy and metals 
at some of our renewable energy projects  our operating subsidiaries purchase fuel in the open markets which exposes us to fuel price risk 
we generally sell the energy output from our projects to local utilities pursuant to long term contracts 
at several of our energy from waste projects  we sell energy output under short term contracts or on a spot basis to our customers 
contracted and merchant capacity our service and waste disposal agreements  as well as our energy contracts  expire at various times 
the extent to which any such expiration will affect us will depend upon a variety of factors  including whether we own the project  market conditions then prevailing  and whether the municipal client exercises options it may have to extend the contract term 
as our contracts expire  we will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  we intend to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate such facilities 
we will also seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as our service and waste disposal agreements at facilities we own or lease expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to us 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
to date  we have been successful in extending a majority of our existing contracts to operate energy from waste facilities owned by municipal clients where market conditions and other factors make it attractive for both us and our municipal clients to do so 
see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview growth and development for additional information 
the extent to which additional extensions will be attractive to us and to our municipal clients who own their projects will depend upon the market and other factors noted above 
however  we do not believe that either our success or lack of success in entering into additional negotiated extensions to operate such facilities will have a material impact on our overall cash flow and profitability in next several years 
see item a 
risk factors our results of operations may be adversely affected by market conditions existing at the time our contracts expire 

table of contents as we seek to enter into extended or new contracts  we expect that medium and long term contracts for waste supply  at least for a substantial portion of facility capacity  will be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace 
we also expect that medium and long term contracts for sales of electricity will be less available than in the past  while medium and long term contracts for sales of other energy products may be more attainable 
as a result  following the expiration of these long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
we have entered into contractual arrangements in order to mitigate our exposure to revenue fluctuations in energy markets through a variety of hedging techniques  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce  and will not involve speculative energy trading 
in conjunction with our energy from waste business  we also own and or operate transfer stations and four ash landfills in the northeast united states  which we utilize to supplement and manage more efficiently the fuel and ash disposal requirements at our energy from waste operations 
we provide waste procurement services to our waste disposal and transfer facilities which have available capacity to receive waste 
with these services  we seek to maximize our revenue and ensure that our energy from waste facilities are being utilized most efficiently  taking into account maintenance schedules and operating restrictions that may exist from time to time at each facility 
we also provide management and marketing of ferrous and non ferrous metals recovered from energy from waste operations  as well as services related to non hazardous special waste destruction and ash residue management for our energy from waste projects 
biomass projects we own and operate seven wood fired generation facilities and have a interest in a partnership which owns another wood fired generation facility 
six of these facilities are located in california  and two are located in maine 
the combined gross energy output from these facilities is megawatts mw 
we generate income from our biomass facilities from sales of electricity  capacity  and where available  additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
these facilities sell their energy output into local power pools or to local utilities at rates that are either fixed or float with the market 
at all of these projects  we purchase fuel pursuant to short term contracts or other arrangements  in each case at prevailing market rates which exposes us to fuel price risk 
the price of fuel varies depending upon the time of year  local supply  and price of energy 
as such  and unlike our energy from waste businesses  we earn income at our biomass facilities based on the margin between our cost of fuel and our revenue from selling the related output 
since  this margin has been negative at certain of our biomass facilities 
at our biomass facilities  lower energy prices combined with higher fuel prices have caused us to economically dispatch operations off line where continued operations are not currently profitable 
we will continue to consider this practice as we study forward energy curves  fuel price forecasts  and the profitability of these facilities 
in  and  revenue from our biomass projects represented approximately  and  respectively  of our americas segment revenue 
hydroelectric we own a equity interest in two small run of river hydroelectric facilities located in the state of washington which sell energy and capacity to puget sound energy under long term energy contracts 
we have a nominal equity investment in two hydroelectric facilities in costa rica
