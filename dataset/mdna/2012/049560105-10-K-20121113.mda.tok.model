item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements  the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  regulatory trends and decisions  including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  possible increased federal  state and local regulation of the safety of our operations  increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in texas  adverse weather conditions  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas  the capital intensive nature of our gas distribution business  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  the threat of cyber attacks or acts of cyber terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from estimates 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
accordingly  these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 
regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a cost based  rate regulated entity  which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards 
we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates 
discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
unbilled revenue sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities  which are subject to refund 
we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
financial instruments and hedging activities we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
the objectives for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 
these objectives are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement 
market value changes result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments 
the recognition of the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are recorded in the income statement is contingent upon whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 
we have elected to treat forward gas supply contracts used in our regulated operations to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales 
financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment do not impact this segment s results of operations as the realized gains and losses are ultimately recovered from ratepayers through our rates 
our nonregulated segment also utilizes financial instruments to manage commodity price risk 
we have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges 
changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in purchased gas cost in the period of change 

table of contents additionally  we have elected to treat fixed price forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales 
financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
our nonregulated segment also uses storage swaps and futures that have not been designated as hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in revenue in the period of change 
finally  financial instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk are designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
the criteria used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex and require management to exercise professional judgment 
further  as more fully discussed below  significant changes in the fair value of these financial instruments could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
within our nonregulated operations  we utilize a mid market pricing convention the mid point between the bid and ask prices for determining fair value measurement  as permitted under current accounting standards 
values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 
we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
fair value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved 
our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 
the fair value of our financial instruments is subject to potentially significant volatility based numerous considerations including  but not limited to changes in commodity prices  interest rates  maturity and settlement of these financial instruments  and our creditworthiness as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
impairment assessments we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill  as required by us accounting standards 
the evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including  but not limited to the commodity prices  the amount and timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affects these estimates  which could result in an impairment charge 

table of contents pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
the market related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets  adjusted to smooth out short term market fluctuations over a five year period 
the use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
contingencies in the normal course of business  we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies 
for such matters  we record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable  based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future 
actual results may differ from estimates  depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure 
changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
our contingencies are further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year 
as 
table of contents a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year 
typically  our accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline  as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills 
gas stored underground  particularly in our natural gas distribution segment  typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 
during fiscal  we earned million  or per diluted share  which represents a four percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal during fiscal  recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments offset an eight percent year over year decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a percent decrease in nonregulated delivered gas sales due to a nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes as a result of warmer weather and a decrease in per unit margins 
additionally  results for fiscal were influenced by several non recurring items  which increased diluted earnings per share by 
on august   we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution assets located in missouri  illinois and iowa to liberty energy midstates corp  an affiliate of algonquin power utilities corp 
for a cash price of approximately million  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement executed on may  in connection with the sale  we recognized a net of tax gain of approximately million 
on august   we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in georgia to liberty energy georgia corp  an affiliate of algonquin power utilities corp 
for a cash price of approximately million 
the agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type  including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing  if applicable 
the closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals 
due to the pending sales transaction  the results of operations for our georgia service area are shown in discontinued operations 
our unsecured senior notes were scheduled to mature in january on july  we issued a notice of early redemption of these notes on august  we initially funded the redemption through the issuance of commercial paper 
on september   we entered into a million short term financing facility to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes 
the facility bears interest at a one month libor based rate plus currently a margin of which is based on the company s credit rating 
the short term facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds received from the issuance of new million senior unsecured notes anticipated to occur in january in connection with the redemption  we paid a make whole premium in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the senior notes and accrued interest at the time of redemption 
in accordance with regulatory requirements  the premium will be deferred and will be recognized over the life of the new unsecured notes expected to be issued in january

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 
natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy  progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms  therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the 
table of contents cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
as discussed above  the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit 
however  higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
in addition  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or  in the case of industrial consumers  to use alternative energy sources 
however  gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately percent of our residential and commercial margins 
as discussed above  on august   we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri  illinois and iowa 
on august  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in georgia 
the results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a million net increase in rate adjustments  primarily in the mid tex  louisiana  mississippi  west texas and kentucky service areas 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease in revenue related taxes in our mid tex  west texas and mississippi service areas  primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated 
million decrease due to an eight percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in the current year compared to last year in most of our service areas 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income increased million primarily due to the following million increase in legal costs  primarily due to settlements 
million increase in employee related costs 
million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with an increase in our net plant as a result of our capital investments in the prior year 
million increase in software maintenance costs 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease in operating expenses due to increased capital spending and warmer weather allowing us time to complete more capital work than in the prior year 
million decrease due to the establishment of regulatory assets for pension and postretirement costs 
miscellaneous income decreased million primarily due to the absence of a million pre tax gain recognized in the prior year as a result of unwinding two treasury locks million  net of tax and a million one time donation to a donor advised fund in the current year 
interest charges decreased million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  refinancing long term debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal additionally  results for fiscal were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of million 
due to the completion of the sale of our missouri  iowa and illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter  the company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas 
the updated analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the company s overall deferred tax liability 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a million net increase in rate adjustments  primarily in the mid tex  louisiana  kentucky and kansas service areas 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease due to a seven percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal in most of our service areas 
million decrease in revenue related taxes  primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated 

table of contents operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income decreased million  primarily due to the following million decrease in taxes  other than income  due to lower revenue related taxes 
million decrease in employee related expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in fiscal million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
million increase in vehicles and equipment expense 
net income for this segment for fiscal was also favorably impacted by a million pre tax gain recognized in march as a result of unwinding two treasury locks and a million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions 
the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division  in order of total rate base  for the fiscal years ended september   and the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes

in thousands mid tex kentucky mid states louisiana west texas mississippi colorado kansas other total regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of excess gas 
our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our mid tex service area 
natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas 
however  natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve  which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline 
further  natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 
the results of atmos pipeline texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

during fiscal  the rrc approved the atmos pipeline texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter 
on april   the rrc approved the atmos pipeline texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after april  operating expenses increased million primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense  resulting from higher investment in net plant 
additionally  results for fiscal were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our missouri  illinois and iowa assets 
net income for this segment for the prior year was favorably impacted by a million pre tax gain recognized in march as a result of unwinding two treasury locks million  net of tax 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  on april   the rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline texas apt that was originally filed in september the rrc approved an annual operating income increase of million as well as the following major provisions that went into effect with bills rendered on and after may  authorized return on equity of percent 
a capital structure of percent debt percent equity 

table of contents approval of a rate base of million  compared to the million rate base from the prior rate case 
an annual adjustment mechanism  which was approved for a three year pilot program  that will adjust regulated rates up or down by percent of the difference between apt s non regulated annual revenue and a pre defined base credit 
approval of a straight fixed variable rate design  under which all fixed costs associated with transportation and storage services are recovered through monthly customer charges 
the million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following million net increase as a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in may million increase associated with our most recent grip filing 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease due to the absence of the sale of excess gas  which occurred in the prior year 
million decrease due to a decline in throughput to our mid tex division primarily due to warmer than normal weather during fiscal operating expenses increased million primarily due to the following million increase due to higher depreciation expense 
million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease related to lower levels of pipeline maintenance activities 
million decrease due to lower employee related expenses 
miscellaneous income includes a million gain recognized in march as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 
nonregulated segment our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings  inc aeh  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 
aeh s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices 
these activities are reflected as gas delivery and related services in the table below 
aeh also earns storage and transportation margins from i utilizing its proprietary mile pipeline located in new orleans  louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana  its gas delivery activities and  on a more limited basis  for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods 
most of these margins are generated through demand fees established under contracts with certain of our natural gas distribution divisions that are renewed periodically and subject to regulatory oversight 
these activities are reflected as storage and transportation services in the table below 
aeh utilizes customer owned or contracted storage capacity to serve its customers 
in an effort to offset the demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity and to maximize the value of this capacity  aeh sells financial instruments in an effort to earn a gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
margins earned from these activities and the related storage demand fees are reported as asset optimization margins 
certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates  which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 

table of contents our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions 
therefore  the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of gas and demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 
further  natural gas market conditions  most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses 
natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country  the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 
natural gas prices can influence the demand for natural gas 
higher prices may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
conversely  lower prices could cause customers such as electric power generators to switch from alternative energy sources to natural gas 
collection of accounts receivable from customers  which could affect the level of bad debt expense recognized by this segment 
the level of borrowings under our credit facilities  which affects the level of interest expense recognized by this segment 
natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways price volatility influences basis differentials  which provide opportunities to profit from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
price volatility also influences the spreads between the current spot prices and forward natural gas prices  which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads 
increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments 
therefore  results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
generally  if the physical financial spread narrows  we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses 
if the physical financial spread widens  we will generally record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period

fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  results for our nonregulated operations during fiscal were adversely influenced by continued unfavorable natural gas market conditions 
historically high natural gas storage levels from strong domestic natural gas production caused natural gas prices to remain relatively low during fiscal additionally  we continued to experience compressed spot to forward spread values and basis differentials 
we anticipate these natural gas market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we anticipate that basis differentials will remain compressed and spot to forward price volatility will remain relatively low 
accordingly  although we anticipate continuing to profit on a fiscal year basis from our nonregulated activities  we anticipate per unit margins from our delivered gas activities and margins earned from our asset optimization activities for the foreseeable future to be more consistent with the performance we have experienced during the last two fiscal years 

table of contents realized margins for gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services were million during the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease reflects the following a nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes 
the decrease was largely attributable to warmer weather  which reduced sales to utility  municipal and other weather sensitive customers 
a mcf decrease in gas delivery per unit margins compared to the prior year primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply and increased transportation costs 
asset optimization margins increased million from the prior year 
the increase primarily reflects higher realized margins earned from the settlement of financial instruments used to hedge our natural gas inventory purchases  partially offset by increased storage fees associated with increased park and loan activity and a million charge in the first fiscal quarter of the current year to write down to market certain natural gas inventory that no longer qualified for fair value hedge accounting 
unrealized margins increased million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of year over year realized margins 
operating expenses  excluding asset impairments decreased million primarily due to lower employee related expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in kentucky 
the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management s decision to focus aeh s activities on its gas delivery  storage and transportation services 
in the prior year  asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of million related to our investment in our fort necessity storage project as well as an million pre tax impairment charge related to the write off of certain natural gas gathering assets 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  realized margins for gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services were million during the year ended september  compared with million for the prior year period 
the increase primarily reflects the following million increase in margins from storage and transportation services  primarily attributable to new drilling projects in the barnett shale area 
million decrease in gas delivery and other services primarily due to lower per unit margins partially offset by a nine percent increase in consolidated delivered gas sales volumes due to new customers in the power generation market 
per unit margins were mcf in the current year compared with mcf in the prior year 
the year over year decrease in per unit margins reflects the impact of increased competition and lower basis spreads 
the million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities 
unrealized margins decreased million in the current period compared to the prior year period primarily due to the timing of year over year realized margins 
operating expenses decreased million primarily due to lower employee related expenses and ad valorem taxes 
during fiscal  our nonregulated segment recognized million of noncash asset impairment charges associated with the two aforementioned projects 
interest charges decreased million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the liquidity required to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources  including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities 
additionally  we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 
finally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 
we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short term and long term needs in a cost effective manner 
we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require 
our unsecured senior notes were scheduled to mature in january on august  we redeemed these notes with proceeds received through the issuance of commercial paper 
on september   we entered into a million short term financing facility that expires february  to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes 
the short term facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the million year unsecured senior notes  which are expected to be issued in january we fixed the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with these anticipated senior notes at by executing three treasury lock agreements in august we designated all of these treasury locks as cash flow hedges 
we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors

vs 
in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income  working capital changes  particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries 
the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in the prior year 
the year over year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by the million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in fiscal september  the year over year decrease reflects the absence of an million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes 
cash flows from investing activities in recent fiscal years  a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
in early fiscal  two coalitions of cities  representing the majority of the cities our mid tex division serves  agreed to a program of installing  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal   steel service line replacements during fiscal and  with approved recovery of the associated return  depreciation and taxes for lines replaced between october  and september  as of september   we had replaced  lines 
since october  we have spent million on steel service line replacements 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the mid tex division  the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our atmos pipeline texas system 
as a result of these projects  we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year 
the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the mid tex division  the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in amarillo  texas  partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company s information technology data center 
cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities used million in cash  while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  generated million in cash compared with cash of million used for the fiscal year ended september  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows during the fiscal year ended september   we paid million for long term debt repayments  including the early redemption of our million senior notes that were scheduled to mature in january 
table of contents borrowed million under a short term loan to finance the repayment of our million senior notes 
borrowed a net million under our short term facilities  excluding the million short term loan used to finance the early redemption of our million senior notes  to fund working capital needs 
paid million in cash dividends  which reflected a payout ratio of percent of net income 
paid million for the repurchase of common stock as part of our share buyback program 
paid million for the repurchase of equity awards 
during the fiscal year ended september   we received million net cash proceeds in june related to the issuance of million senior notes due borrowed a net million under our short term facilities to fund working capital needs 
received million cash in march related to the unwinding of two treasury locks 
received million cash in june related to the settlement of three treasury locks associated with the million senior notes offering 
received million net proceeds related to the issuance of million shares of common stock 
paid million for scheduled long term debt repayments  including our million senior notes that were paid on their maturity date on may  paid million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of percent of net income 
paid million for the repurchase of equity awards 
during the fiscal year ended september   we paid million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of percent of net income 
paid million for the repurchase of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
borrowed a net million under our short term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases 
received million net proceeds related to the issuance of million shares of common stock  which is a percent decrease compared to the prior year due primarily to the fact that beginning in fiscal shares were purchased on the open market rather than being issued by us to the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan 
paid million to repurchase equity awards 

table of contents the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september   and for the fiscal year ended september shares issued direct stock purchase plan retirement savings plan long term incentive plan outside directors stock for fee plan total shares issued the decreased number of shares issued in fiscal compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares issued under our long term incentive plan ltip  due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal during fiscal  we cancelled and retired  shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired  shares attributable to our share repurchase program  which are not included in the table above 
the increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal primarily reflects an increased number of shares issued under our ltip due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal this increase was partially offset by the fact that we purchased shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan 
during fiscal  we cancelled and retired  shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired  shares attributable to our accelerated share repurchase agreement  which are not included in the table above 
as of september   we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of million shares of common stock under our ltip 
in february  shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized ltip shares by million shares 
on october   we received all required state regulatory approvals to increase the maximum number of authorized ltip shares to million shares  subject to certain adjustment provisions 
on october   we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to register an additional million shares  we also listed such shares with the new york stock exchange 
credit facilities our short term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business 
changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 
we finance our short term borrowing requirements through a combination of a million commercial paper program collateralized by our million unsecured credit facility and four committed revolving credit facilities with third party lenders 
as a result  we have approximately million of working capital funding 
additionally  our million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature  which  if utilized  would increase borrowing capacity to billion 
we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these third party committed credit facilities 
shelf registration we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that permits us to issue a total of billion in common stock and or debt securities 
the shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions 
with the closing of the sale of our missouri  illinois and iowa operations on august   there are no longer any restrictions on our ability to issue either debt or equity under the shelf until it expires on march   with million available for issuance at september  we intend to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec for at least billion prior to the expiration of the current shelf 

table of contents credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings  ltd 
fitch 
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows s p moody s fitch unsecured senior long term debt bbb baa a commercial paper a p f a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies 
this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for s p  aaa for moody s and aaa for fitch 
the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for s p  baa for moody s and bbb for fitch 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant

aeh is committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 

table of contents with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of september  are reflected in the table above 
risk management activities as discussed above in our critical accounting policies  we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and  periodically  to manage interest rate risk 
we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we use financial instruments  designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices  to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixed priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers  and we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment 
also  in our nonregulated segment  we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 
we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument 
substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices

fair value of contracts at september  maturity in years source of fair value less than greater than total fair value in thousands prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value employee benefits programs an important element of our total compensation program  and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense  is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees 
these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 
medical and dental insurance we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees  and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry 
since  we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent 
in recent years  we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 
in march  president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the health care reform act 
the health care reform act will be phased in over an eight year period 
we have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years 
for example  lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated  coverage for dependent children has been extended to age and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer 
in  health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals 
companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage 
however  companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange 
we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 
for fiscal  we anticipate an approximate seven percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate  primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 

table of contents net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates 
a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base  and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
our fiscal costs were determined using a september  measurement date 
at that date  interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
accordingly  we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to percent 
our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation 
as a result  our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at september   the measurement date for our fiscal pension and postretirement costs 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
at our september  measurement date  the interest rates were significantly higher than the interest rates at september   the measurement date used to determine our fiscal net periodic cost 
our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
in accordance with the pension protection act of ppa  we determined the funded status of our plans as of january  based on this valuation  we were required to contribute cash of million to our pension plans during fiscal the need for this funding primarily reflects a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our obligations under our plans 
this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 
during fiscal  we were required to contribute cash of million to our pension plans 
the need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during and this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 
during fiscal  we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal and beyond as of september   interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates  which impacted our fiscal net periodic pension and postretirement costs  were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates  we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 
table of contents pension and benefit costs to percent 
we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at percent  based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation 
due to the decrease in our discount rate  we expect our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal based upon market conditions subsequent to september  the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa  we anticipate contributing between million and million to the plans in fiscal further  we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds 
with respect to our postretirement medical plans  we anticipate contributing between million and million during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
in august  the board of directors of atmos energy approved a proposal to close the pension account plan pap to new participants  effective october  employees participating in the pap as of october  were allowed to make a one time election to migrate from the pap into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features  effective january  participants who chose to remain in the pap have continued to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits 
recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
therefore  our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 
nonregulated segment our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our nonregulated segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to 
table of contents our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during
