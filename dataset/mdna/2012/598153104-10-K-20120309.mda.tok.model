company overview midway is a development stage company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  and  if warranted  development of gold and silver mineral properties in north america 
our mineral properties are located in nevada and washington 
the tonopah formerly referred to as midway  spring valley  gold rock  and golden eagle gold properties are exploratory stage projects and have identified gold mineralization and the thunder mountain and burnt canyon projects are earlier stage gold and silver exploration projects 
our pan project is in the early development stage and the company is currently transitioning itself from an exploration company to a gold production company with plans to advance the pan gold deposit located in white pine county  nevada through to production by as early as spring valley project barrick has the exclusive right to earn a interest in the spring valley project by spending us  on the property over five years 
barrick may increase its interest by total by spending an additional us  in the year immediately after vesting at 
at the company s election  barrick may also earn an additional total by carrying the company to a production decision and arranging financing for the company s share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by barrick once production has been established 
barrick has informed the company that it has conducted and funded exploration in on the spring valley project to meet its minimum level of us  see item description of properties spring valley project for a more detailed description of the agreement with barrick and the exploration program 
pan project during november  the results of a feasibility study for the pan gold project were finalized 
the company has submitted a mine plan of operations to the principal permitting agencies which has initiated the permitting process for the project 
see item description of properties pan project for a more detailed description of the exploration program 
tonopah formerly midway project during  multiple high grade intercepts were identified as a result of the drilling program in the discovery zone 
the drill program totaled  meters of core with  meters in the discovery zone  meters in the zone  meters in the dauntless zone  meters in the zone  and meters in a geotechnical hole near the site of a possible future mine shaft 
see item description of properties midway project for a more detailed description of the exploration program 
gold rock project during  efforts were focused on the drilling program that was designed to confirm historic data and to test for expansion potential 
as a result the company drilled  feet in holes 
the drill results were positive  showing a significant increase above the previously reported historic estimate 
see item description of properties gold rock project for a more detailed description of the exploration program 
golden eagle project during  the company commissioned a preliminary economic assessment to evaluate the economics of different mining options 
the company is continuing to evaluate issues related to processing sulfide mineralization and permitting 
see item description of properties golden eagle project for a more detailed description of the exploration program 
exploration projects the company maintained its interests in the thunder mountain and burnt canyon projects 
however  on december   as part of management s annual review of mineral property holdings it was determined that burnt canyon was impaired and was subsequently written down by the amount of results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and the net loss for the year ended december  was  significant differences in costs between the years are as follows total expenses for the year ended december  were  the increase in expenses is primarily due to increased exploration activities  primarily related to the pan  tonopah and gold rock projects see below table for details 
consulting expenses for the year ended december  were    which includes non cash stock based compensation of  nil  nil 
included in consulting fees was    paid to golden oak corporate services  a company wholly owned by doris meyer  the company s former chief financial officer and corporate secretary for financial reporting and corporate compliance services 
legal  audit and accounting fees for the year ended december  were   
during  the company continued to incur significant legal and auditing fees primarily related to the costs associated with being a public company and the current legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
in  the company incurred significant legal and auditing costs as it investigated and evaluated business opportunities 
mineral exploration expenditures for the year ended december  were    which includes non cash stock based compensation of   
the details of the exploration expenses in each year may be found in the schedule of the audited consolidated annual financial statements  but are summarized here fiscal year tonopah project    spring valley project    pan project    burnt canyon project    thunder mountain project    gold rock project    golden eagle project    property investigations and abandoned properties   total    exploration levels are determined by the success of previous exploration programs on each project and in part by available cash to fund additional programs 
as discussed earlier barrick has been funding the spring valley project since the beginning of and the expenses reported by the company related to activities not funded by barrick 
salaries and benefits charged to administration totalled    which includes non cash stock based compensation of   
we use an option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
it is difficult to estimate the value of options that we grant 
we use the black scholes merton model  which requires considerable judgment selecting the subjective assumptions that are critical to the results produced by the model  to calculate the estimated fair value 
we record the estimated fair value as an expense on a pro rata basis over the vesting period of the options 
the increase in the cash component of salaries and benefits is attributable to an increase in the number of employees  as of december  compared to as of december the income tax recovery of    and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of    which is included within the foreign exchange gain of    relate to the us dollar denominated future income tax liability recorded upon the acquisition of pan nevada and the tonopah and spring valley projects 
us gaap requires the value of share purchase warrants issued with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than the company s canadian dollar functional currency to be considered as a liability and this liability is stated at fair value for each reporting period 
the share purchase warrants included in the public offering of units that closed in november   had an exercise price of us 
at november   the fair value of the warrants and the resulting warrant liability was  and at december  the fair value of the warrants and the warrant liability was  with the difference of  recorded as a loss on warrant liability in midway subsequently accelerated the expiry date of these warrants and by march    of the us share purchase warrants had been exercised and  warrants expired unexercised 
as a result  the warrant liability was extinguished in the first quarter of financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of  consisting of current assets of  and current liabilities of  this represents an increase of  from the working capital balance of  as of december  and reflects the proceeds of recently completed equity sales 
our current assets consist primarily of cash  some of which is deposited in short term  interest bearing accounts 
consistent with our plans  we continued to consume working capital to fund our exploration activities and other operating expenses  and we replenished our working capital through the sale of common shares 
we have never received revenue from gold or other mineral sales 
any revenue generated from the sale of gold or silver will be used to pay for operating costs first and then to supplement our existing cash for construction  additional exploration and other working capital needs 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the foreseeable future 
in addition to the cash balance held as of december   midway plans to undertake financing in to fund exploration activities and operations through the next twelve months 
the company s ability to continue on a going concern basis beyond the next twelve months depends on its ability to successfully raise additional financing for the substantial capital expenditures required to achieve planned principal operations 
while the company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing  there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
we have historically primarily relied on equity financings to fund our operations 
from inception through december   we received  in cash  services  stock options  and other consideration through the issuance of our common shares 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
management will be reviewing cash expenditures on an ongoing basis  and may be seeking to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that management will succeed in obtaining additional financing  now or in the future 
the current market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for management to raise necessary funds to meet the company s capital requirements 
failure to raise additional financing on a timely basis could cause the company to suspend its operations and eventually to forfeit or sell its interest in its properties 
in the past  management has been successful at raising funds to continue work on its mining properties 
however  there is no certainty that management will be able to raise additional funding on reasonable terms if at all  in which case the property may be joint ventured  sold or abandoned 
the company s financial statements do not reflect adjustments that would be necessary if the going concern assumption were not appropriate 
on april   the alberta  british columbia and ontario securities commissions issued a final receipt for the company s short form prospectus  which along with the company s s shelf registration statement under the securities act of  as amended  declared effective by the sec on february  jointly the prospectus  allows the company to offer and sell  from time to time over a twenty five month period  up to us  of the company s common shares  without par value  with or without warrants to purchase common shares  or any combination thereof in one or more transactions under the prospectus 
the company may also offer under the prospectus any common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants 
on june   the company issued  common shares upon the close of a bought deal public offering at a purchase price of us per share for gross proceeds to the company of  us 
on september   the company announced that it had established an at the market atm issuance program under which it may sell up to a maximum of  of its common shares 
the atm issuance program is available to the company on an as needed basis 
subject to market conditions and funding requirements  the company may  at its discretion  from time to time sell all  some  or none of the reserved shares during the term of the atm program 
any common shares issued under the atm program will be sold through atm issuances in the united states 
no atm issuances will be made through the facilities of any canadian exchange 
any atm issuances will be made at market prices prevailing at the time of the sale and  as a result  prices may vary 
during  the company issued  shares pursuant to the atm program 
proceeds received on the  common shares issued totalled as of march   there are  stock options outstanding at prices ranging from to and  share purchase warrants at 
while it is probable that some of these options and share purchase warrants will be exercised  it is not possible to predict the timing or the amount of funds which might be received 
net cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december   compared to  during  an increase of  the significant increase in is primarily attributable to an increase in our net loss of  and an increase in our future income tax recovery of  this was offset by an increase of non cash stock compensation of 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  although most of our exploration stage expenditures are recorded as an expense rather than an investment  we capitalize the acquisition cost of land and mineral rights and certain equipment that has alternative future uses or significant salvage value  including rolling stock  furniture  and electronics  and the cost of these capitalized assets is reflected in our investing activities 
during  we invested in a residential building  residential land parcels and vehicles 
during  we acquired additional vehicles 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  consisting of net proceeds from the sales of our common shares 
during  all of the cash from financing activities related to the sale of our common shares 
the balance of cash and equivalents increased to  as of december  from  as of december   a net increase in cash of  off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the company has an obligation under an operating lease for its corporate offices in denver  colorado until december as follows 
future minimum lease payments for non cancellable leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year are included 
fiscal year operating leases total  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as of december   we have accrued  us  related to reclamation and other closure requirements at our properties  compared to  us  at december  these liabilities are covered by a combination of surety bonds and restricted cash totaling  us  at december   us 
we have accrued as a current liability what management believes is the present value of our best estimate of the liabilities as of december   however  it is possible that our obligations may change in the near or long term depending on a number of factors 
critical accounting policies we believe that application of the following accounting policies  which are critical to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates that are critical to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the identification and valuation of proven and probable reserves  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  estimates related to asset impairments of long lived assets and investments  classification of expenditures as either an asset or an expense  valuation of deferred tax assets  and the likelihood of loss contingencies management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are revised periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period it is determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
proven and probable reserves the definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in sec industry guide proven reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in addition  reserves cannot be considered proven and probable until they are supported by a feasibility study  indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic  technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable at the time of the reserve determination 
mineral acquisition costs the costs of acquiring land and mineral rights are considered tangible assets 
significant acquisition payments are capitalized 
general  administrative and holding costs to maintain an exploration property are expensed as incurred 
if a mineable ore body is discovered  such costs are amortized when production begins using the units of production method 
if no mineable ore body is discovered or such rights are otherwise determined to have diminished value  such costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made 
exploration costs exploration costs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs to identify new mineral resources  to evaluate potential resources  and to convert mineral resources into proven and probable reserves are considered exploration costs 
design  construction  and development costs certain costs to design and construct mine and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves 
under these circumstances  we classify such projects as an exploration stage project and expense substantially all costs  including design  engineering  construction  and installation of equipment 
certain types of equipment  which have alternative uses or significant salvage value  may be capitalized 
if a project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  costs incurred in anticipation of production can be capitalized 
such costs include development drilling to further delineate the ore body  removing overburden during the pre production phase  building access ways  constructing facilities  and installing equipment 
interest costs  if any  incurred during the development phase  would be capitalized until the assets are ready for their intended use 
the cost of start up activities and on going costs to maintain production are expensed as incurred 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
if a project commences commercial production and the project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  amortization and depletion of capitalized costs is computed on a unit of production basis over the expected reserves of the project based on estimated recoverable gold equivalent ounces 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform additional analysis to quantify the amount by which capitalized costs exceed recoverable value 
the periodic evaluation of capitalized costs is based upon expected future cash flows  including estimated salvage values 
as of december   some of our mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven and probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions 
accordingly  recoverability of capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values  or alternative future uses 
property and equipment all items of property and equipment are carried at cost not in excess of their estimated net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings while expenditures for major maintenance and betterments are capitalized 
gains or losses on disposition are recognized in operations 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for the fair value of stock options that are granted 
expense is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting periods  if any  of the options 
the fair value of stock options at their grant date is estimated by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
income taxes income taxes are computed using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and the effect of net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances have been established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets in recognition of significant uncertainties regarding their ultimate realization 
further  the evaluation has determined that there are no uncertain tax positions required to be disclosed 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations  primarily the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec  and the emerging issues task force eitf  to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and the impact on the company 
recently adopted accounting standards on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu compensation stock compensation topic effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades 
this asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods for fiscal years beginning on or after december  this asu added to or amends sections of accounting codification standards acs topic these amendments and additions impact the accounting treatment as follows a a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades shall not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition and  therefore shall not be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for equity classification 
b if an award is indexed to a factor in addition the entity s share price 
if that factor is not a market  performance  or service condition eg  indexed to the market price of a commodity such as gold  the award shall be classified as a liability 
recently issued accounting standards updates accounting standards update no 
fair value measurements update in may  the fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements as a result of the fasb and the iasb working together to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments will add new disclosures  with a particular focus on level measurements 
the objective of these amendments is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively 
the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application is not permitted 
the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards update no 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
under asu  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under both options  an entity will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu  which deferred the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income while the fasb further deliberates this aspect of the proposal 
the amendments contained in asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments also do not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
asu  as amended by asu  is effective for us on january  the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
