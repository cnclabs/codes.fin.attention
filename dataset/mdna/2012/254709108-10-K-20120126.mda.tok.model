our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers  merchants and issuers 
the primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs interest expense  loan loss provisions  customer rewards  and expenses incurred to grow  manage and service our loan receivables and networks

change in accounting principle related to off balance sheet securitizations beginning with the first quarter  we have included the trusts used in our securitization activities in our consolidated financial results in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

 amendments to fasb interpretations no 
r statement no 
codified under asc section  consolidation  which were effective for us on december   the beginning of our fiscal year 
under statement no 
 the trusts used in our securitization transactions are no longer exempt from consolidation 
statement no 
prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated in our financial statements 
based on our assessment  we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent the trusts and accordingly  we began consolidating the trusts on december  using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by statement no 
 we recorded a billion increase in total assets  a billion increase in total liabilities and a billion decrease in stockholders equity comprised of a billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of billion in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the significant adjustments to our statement of financial condition upon adoption of statements no 
and are outlined below consolidation of billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors  reclassification of billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables  recording of a billion allowance for loan losses  not previously required under gaap  for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables  derecognition of the remaining billion value of the interest only strip receivable  net of tax  recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash  loan receivables and other assets  and recording of net deferred tax assets of billion  largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables 

table of contents beginning with the first quarter  our results of operations no longer reflect securitization income  but instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
also  there are no gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities 
notwithstanding this accounting treatment  our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from discover bank  and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts  even in insolvency  receivership or conservatorship proceedings 
we do  however  continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts 
reconciliations of gaap to non gaap as adjusted data to enable the reader to better understand our financial information by reflecting period over period data on a consistent basis  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presents our financial information as of and for the years ended november  and as compared to non gaap as adjusted results of operations data for the year ended november   and  where necessary  we have also provided certain information as of and for the year ended november  and on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
management believes the non gaap as adjusted financial information is useful to investors as it aligns with the financial information used in management s decision making process and in evaluating the business 
the following describes the adjustments made to arrive at the non gaap as adjusted financial information settlement income adjustments the non gaap as adjusted amounts remove the impact of income received in connection with the settlement of our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard during the years ended november  and  which resulted in unusually large amounts in other income and affect comparability of results between periods 
special dividend interest adjustments the non gaap as adjusted amounts exclude the interest charge related to our dispute with morgan stanley regarding the special dividend agreement  which  among other things  specified how proceeds of the antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard were to be shared 
statements no 
and adjustments the non gaap as adjusted amounts show how our financial data would have been presented if the trusts used in our securitization activities were consolidated into our financial statements for historical periods prior to fiscal year we did not retrospectively adopt statements no 
and and  therefore  the consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report as of and for the years ended november  and reflect the new accounting requirements  but the historical statement of income and statement of cash flows for the year ended november  continue to reflect the accounting applicable prior to the adoption of the new accounting requirements 
the impacts of statements no 
and on our earnings summary  detail of other income and direct banking segment information are reflected in two steps in the reconciliations of gaap to non gaap as adjusted data in the tables below 
first  we made securitization adjustments to reverse the effect of loan securitization by recharacterizing securitization income to report interest income  interest expense  provision for loan losses  discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income in the same line items as non securitized loans 
these adjustments result in a managed basis presentation  which we have historically included in our quarterly and annual reports to reflect the way in which our senior management evaluated our business performance and allocated resources 
then  in addition to the adjustments to remove the litigation settlement income and the interest related to the special dividend paid to morgan stanley  adjustments were made to reflect results as if the trusts used in our securitization activities had been fully consolidated in our historical results 
these adjustments include elimination of interest income and interest expense related to certificated retained interests classified as investment securities and associated intercompany debt  an adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the change in securitized loan receivables  elimination of the revaluation gains or losses associated with the interest only strip receivable  which was derecognized upon adoption of statements no 
and  and an adjustment to reflect the income tax effects related to these adjustments 

table of contents the impacts of statements no 
and on our effective tax rate  loan receivables and average balance sheet information and certain other selected financial data are reflected in one step  rather than two  in the reconciliations of gaap to non gaap as adjusted data set forth in the tables below as there is no meaningful difference between such information on a historical managed basis as compared to on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
the following tables display a reconciliation between gaap  previously reported managed results  and non gaap as adjusted amounts that reflect the exclusion of litigation settlement proceeds and interest related to the morgan stanley special dividend  which were unrelated to the adoption of statements no 
and  and reflect the full impact the consolidation of our trusts would have had if we had adopted statements no 
and retrospectively

table of contents highlights net income in was billion as compared to net income of million in discover card sales volume showed strong year over year growth of totaling billion in as compared to billion in this growth was driven primarily by an increase in spending by both new and existing customers partially due to increased marketing 
the delinquency rate for our credit card loans over days past due improved dramatically during  reaching an all time low at november  of  which was down from the prior year rate of 
the primary reason for this decline was the improvement throughout in the underlying credit quality of our portfolio as the us economy stabilized following an extended period of increasing unemployment levels 
our total loan portfolio increased year over year to billion  mainly due to the acquisition of the student loan corporation slc in december  which added approximately billion of private student loans to our portfolio  and the acquisition of approximately billion of private student loans from citibank  na citi in september in addition  billion is attributed to an increase in credit card loans due to higher volumes and lower charge offs 
payment services continued to produce strong results with pretax income of million  up over the prior year 
transaction volume for the segment was billion  an increase of as compared to the prior year 
we repurchased million shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock for million in and highlights our revenues were unfavorably impacted in by the implementation of certain provisions of the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act  which included limitations on our ability to reprice accounts  the elimination of overlimit fees and a reduction in the amount of standard late fees 
we settled our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard for billion in through  we received a total of billion billion after tax from visa for its portion of the settlement 
at the time of our spin off  we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared  among other things 
in  we paid morgan stanley a dividend of million under an amendment to that agreement 
recent developments on december   we entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our remaining million of federal student loans currently classified as loans held for sale 
the majority of these loans were pledged as collateral against a long term borrowing and  as part of this transaction  these borrowings are expected to be assumed by the purchaser 
these transactions  which are subject to customary closing conditions  including the receipt of governmental approvals  are expected to close in february effective december   we terminated our billion unsecured committed credit facility 
this facility had no borrowings against it as of november  for more information  see liquidity and capital resources liquidity management 
on january   we paid a dividend of per share of our common stock  which was an increase from the per share dividend that we paid in the previous quarter 
outlook credit performance continued to improve through as we approached historical lows in delinquency and net charge off rates 
in  we do not expect reserve releases to continue at previous levels and we anticipate that growth in our loan portfolio will lead to increases in loan loss reserves 
we are focused on growing our card receivables in through new account acquisitions and wallet share gains resulting from marketing and advertising efforts as well as increased acceptance by merchants in the us and major international destinations for us travelers 
we are also targeting solid growth and strong returns in our private student and personal loan portfolios  while continuing to pursue other opportunities to diversify our direct banking business  such as our pending acquisition of the mortgage origination business of tree 
com  inc we anticipate further total yield compression in due to the continuing effects of card act implementation  an increase in promotional offers and the expected growth in personal and private student loans  which tend to carry lower interest rates than our card receivables 
we expect this yield compression to be somewhat offset by continued funding cost improvements 
funding costs are expected to continue to decline over the next year as we benefit from the interest rate environment and replace higher priced time deposits with lower cost borrowings 
net interest margin is expected to remain relatively stable through as in  we intend to continue to maintain a strong capital level while targeting investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program 

table of contents our payments business had strong volume growth in we continue to focus on investments to build brand awareness and acceptance globally through support of our diners club network and arrangements with other networks and merchant acquirers 
recently  we have been successful in developing relationships with leading merchant acquirers in key markets  including canada  the united kingdom and western europe  to further increase acceptance and volumes 
pulse  our debit card network  in preparation for the april  effective date of the federal regulations mandating that debit and prepaid card issuers participate in two or more unaffiliated payment networks  has increased its processing capacity for potential additional volume 
regulatory environment and developments overview the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets 
the reform act addresses risks to the economy and the payments system  especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms 
bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets covered companies  including discover  are considered systemically significant under the reform act and are subject to heightened prudential standards to be established by the federal reserve 
certain provisions of the reform act that may have a significant impact on us are described in more detail below under the headings consumer financial services  payment networks  capital and liquidity and asset backed securities 
the reform act also provides for restrictions on and additional disclosure of executive compensation  additional corporate governance requirements and far more stringent requirements with respect to affiliate transactions and mergers and acquisitions 
the effect of the reform act and other regulatory initiatives on our business and operations could be significant  depending upon final implementing regulations  the actions of our competitors and the behavior of consumers and other marketplace participants 
the reform act  other legislative and regulatory changes  and enhanced scrutiny by our regulators could have a significant impact on us by  for example  requiring us to limit or change our business practices  limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities  requiring us to invest valuable management time and resources in compliance efforts  imposing additional costs on us  limiting fees we can charge for services  requiring us to meet more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements including those under basel iii  increasing our cost or ability to access the securitization markets for our funding  impacting the value of our assets  or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses 
for additional information regarding the impact of the reform act and other regulatory initiatives on us  see risk factors 
consumer financial services the reform act established the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  which regulates consumer financial products and services provided by certain financial services providers  including discover 
in july  many consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other agencies transferred to the cfpb 
the cfpb is authorized to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practices and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair  transparent and competitive 
the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the reform act and other federal consumer financial services laws including the card act  as well as broad supervisory  examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services  such as discover 
state officials are authorized to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb and other requirements of the reform act 
the cfpb is already engaged in consumer education  supervision  examination and investigatory activities 
in late  it began tracking consumer complaints for credit cards and mortgages via an online process that is expected to expand to student loans in there is significant legislative and regulatory focus on the student loan market  including by the cfpb  which has made the student loan market a priority area of focus 
under the reform act  the cfpb and department of education doe are required to prepare a report on private education loans and private educational lenders by july that examines  among other things  the private education loan market  underwriting criteria used by lenders  loan terms  conditions and pricing  consumer protections available to borrowers  and fair lending considerations 
the reform act also created a private education ombudsman within the cfpb to receive and attempt to informally resolve complaints about private student loans  and the cfpb plans to receive such complaints via its online consumer complaint system 
in addition  the obama administration has made changes to the federal student loan program intended to make college more affordable and make it easier for students to repay their federal student loans 
congress or the administration may take actions that impact the student loan market in the future  including as a result of the cfpb and doe study 
the possible impact of heightened scrutiny of the student loan market and its participants  including any resulting legislative and regulatory initiatives  is uncertain and may adversely impact the profitability and growth of our private student loan portfolio 

table of contents our banking regulators have introduced and continue to introduce new regulations and supervisory guidance and practices in response to the heightened congressional and regulatory focus on consumer financial services generally  increasing their scrutiny over us and the industry 
also  additional legislative or regulatory action that may impact our businesses may result from the multiple studies mandated under the reform act  such as the cfpb and doe study of private student loans referenced above 
we are unable to predict whether any additional changes to statutes or regulations affecting the consumer financial services industry  including the interpretation or implementation thereof  will occur in the future 
payment networks certain reform act provisions require that interchange fees paid to or charged by payment card issuers on debit card and certain prepaid transactions be reasonable and proportional to the issuer s cost in connection with such transactions  as determined by the federal reserve 
the reform act also prohibits debit and prepaid card networks and issuers from requiring debit and prepaid card transactions to be processed solely on a single payment network  or two or more affiliated payment networks 
in addition  provisions of the reform act prohibit credit debit network rules that restrict merchants from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment  or from setting minimum transaction amounts of or less for use of credit cards  as long as such merchant practices do not differentiate on the basis of the issuer or network 
the federal reserve issued final implementing regulations with respect to the interchange fee and routing provisions in june  some of which became effective in october regulations mandating that debit and prepaid card issuers participate in two or more unaffiliated payment networks take effect april  discover network and pulse have modified operating rules  interchange fee schedules and existing agreements to ensure consistency with the reform act and federal reserve implementing regulations 
pulse has increased its processing capacity for potential additional volume 
the ultimate impact of these laws and regulations will depend upon the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants 
for example  the national retail federation  the food marketing institute  the national association of convenience stores and two retailers have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the federal reserve implementing regulations and  in particular  the interchange fee provisions  on the grounds that  among other things  the federal reserve did not properly apply the reform act 
it is uncertain how pulse s business practices  network transaction volume  revenue  and prospects for future growth  as well as the debit card market as a whole  may be impacted by the industry s competitive response to these new requirements 
capital and liquidity consistent with reform act requirements to impose enhanced prudential standards on covered companies  in november  the federal reserve issued a final rule requiring covered companies to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve for its review and non objection 
a capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon at least nine quarters  beginning with the quarter preceding the quarter in which the covered company submits its capital plan that reflects the company s size  complexity  risk profile  and scope of operations  assuming both expected and stressful conditions 
the capital plan must include a calculation of regulatory capital ratios over the planning horizon under expected conditions and under a range of stressed scenarios and discussion of how the company will maintain capital above each minimum capital ratio  including a pro forma tier common ratio meaning the ratio of tier common capital to total risk weighted assets above  under these scenarios 
the instructions accompanying the federal reserve s final rule regarding capital plans indicate that the federal reserve expects covered companies to show that they can achieve readily and without difficulty the ratios required by the basel iii framework as they would come into effect in the united states 
basel iii refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee in december  the rules text released in december and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements 
implementation of basel iii in the us will require implementing regulations and guidelines by us banking regulators  which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
it is unclear how us banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of basel iii 
we continue to monitor the implementation of basel iii in the us based on current industry expectations regarding the content of the regulations to be implemented and our capital profile  we currently anticipate that we will be able to meet the regulatory requirements 
under the federal reserve s final capital plan rule  covered companies with capital plans viewed as unsatisfactory by the federal reserve will face limits on their ability to make capital distributions  including share repurchases and dividends 
further  a covered company generally will be required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve to make capital distributions in certain other cases  including if after giving effect to the distribution the covered company would not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio  including a tier common ratio of at least  the capital distribution would exceed the amount set forth in the covered company s approved capital plan or the federal reserve makes certain determinations 
a covered company must update and re submit its capital plan to the federal reserve within calendar days subject to extension if there has been or will be a material change in the company s risk profile  financial condition  or corporate structure  and will generally not be able to make a capital distribution unless the federal reserve has approved such distribution 

table of contents in addition  on december   the federal reserve issued proposed rules to implement reform act heightened prudential standards requirements related to risk based capital and leverage  liquidity  single counterparty credit limits  overall risk management and risk committees  stress tests  and a debt to equity limit for covered companies that the financial stability oversight council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability 
the proposal also includes rules to implement the early remediation requirements in the reform act related to establishing measures of financial condition and remediation requirements that increase in stringency as the financial condition of a covered company declines 
the capital  leverage and stress test proposals work in tandem with the federal reserve s annual capital plan requirements by establishing a framework for capital stress testing under which the federal reserve would  on an annual basis  conduct an analysis of a covered company s capital  taking into account all relevant exposures and activities of the covered company to evaluate the ability of the covered company to absorb losses and continue to function as a credit intermediary as a result of adverse and severely adverse economic and financial market conditions 
the federal reserve will conduct its analysis using a minimum of three different sets of economic and financial conditions scenarios  including baseline  adverse  and severely adverse conditions  and will make public a summary of the results  including company specific information 
further  covered companies will be required to perform one or more company run capital stress tests each year using a baseline  adverse  and severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve as well as a baseline  adverse and severely adverse scenario developed by the covered company  and to make a summary of the results public 
in the initial phase  covered companies will be subject to the federal reserve s capital plan rule  described above  including the requirement to maintain a tier common ratio greater than 
the federal reserve states that  in a second phase  it intends to supplement the enhanced risk based capital requirements contained in its capital plan rule with a subsequent proposal to implement a quantitative risk based capital surcharge for covered companies or a subset of covered companies 
the quantitative risk based capital surcharge would be based on the basel committee s approach and implementation timeframe  which contemplates adopting implementing rules in and requiring global systemically important banks to meet the capital surcharges on a phased in basis from the federal reserve also notes that it and the other us federal banking agencies are continuing to work on implementing the other basel iii capital requirements in the united states but  other than with respect to the capital surcharge  does not provide further details with respect to such implementation 
the federal reserve proposed rules related to liquidity would subject covered companies to a set of enhanced liquidity risk management standards  including liquidity stress testing 
the proposal would require covered companies to conduct internal stress tests at least monthly to measure their liquidity needs during times of instability in the financial markets and to hold highly liquid assets that would be sufficient to cover day stressed net cash outflows under their internal stress scenarios 
covered companies also would be required to meet specified corporate governance requirements around liquidity risk management  to project cash flow needs over various time horizons  to establish internal limits on certain liquidity metrics  and to maintain a contingency funding plan that identifies potential sources of liquidity strain and alternative sources of funding when usual sources of liquidity are unavailable 
the federal reserve indicates that  in a second phase  it and the other us federal banking agencies plan to issue one or more proposals to implement quantitative liquidity requirements based on basel iii that would be applicable to all or a subset of covered companies 
on january   the fdic approved a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the provisions of the reform act that require state nonmember banks with consolidated assets of more than billion  such as discover bank  to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests 
in terms of its requirements  the notice of proposed rulemaking is substantively similar to the federal reserve s december  proposed rules described above 
also on january   the fdic approved a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with billion or more in total assets  such as discover bank  to submit to the fdic periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institution s failure 
this final rule follows an interim final rule relating to insured depository institution resolution plans and separate joint rulemaking with the federal reserve that the fdic approved in september pursuant to section d of the reform act requiring bank holding companies with billion or more in consolidated assets including us and certain other financial companies to submit a resolution plan or so called living will to the fdic  the federal reserve  and the financial stability oversight council for their rapid and orderly liquidation in the event of material financial distress or failure 
the fdic s final rule and the separate joint rulemaking rules are meant to be complementary and use the same staggered submission schedule 
under the rules  the initial resolution plans for us and discover bank are required to be submitted on or before december  thereafter  we and discover bank are required to update such plans annually and  in certain circumstances  more frequently 
asset backed securities the reform act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets  some of which may impact our ability and or desire to utilize those markets to meet funding and liquidity needs 
for more information regarding these and other changes related to asset backed securities that may impact us  see risk factors if we are unable to securitize our receivables  it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cost of funds and overall financial condition  liquidity and capital resources funding sources credit card securitization financing and liquidity and capital resources credit ratings

for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity  it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period 
for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions  significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain cases  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses  the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost  the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  estimates of future cash flows associated with purchased credit impaired loans and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses we base our allowance for loan loss on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date 
while our estimation process includes historical data and analysis  there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance 
we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables 
management also estimates loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts 
the considerations in these analyses include past performance  risk management techniques applied to various accounts  historical behavior of different account vintages  current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies  bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates  and forecasting uncertainties 
given the same information  others may reach different reasonable estimates 
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses  the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in management s estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at november   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses 
see loan quality and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses 
customer rewards cost we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program  pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer s purchases 
the liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity 
the liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
in determining the forfeiture estimate  we consider historical rewards redemption and forfeiture behavior  the level of recent customer purchase activity and the terms of the current rewards programs 
we generally recognize reward costs as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
if management used a different estimate of forfeitures  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed 
for example  a basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of november   could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million 
the corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue 
see other income and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost 
goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets 
in addition  we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business 
as required by gaap  we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  management must estimate the fair value of the business unit s to which the goodwill relates 
because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable 
table of contents businesses typically are not readily obtainable  other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses 
similarly  in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models 
in applying these techniques  management considers historical results  business forecasts  market and industry conditions and other factors 
we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques 
the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance  revenue and expense growth  discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature 
if economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations  we may be exposed to an impairment loss that  when recognized  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
at november   there were no reporting units or intangible assets that were at reasonable risk for failing the respective impairment evaluations 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations  primarily the united states  its states and municipalities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes  interpretations of tax laws  the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken 
when such changes occur  the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
purchased credit impaired loans the estimate of expected future cash flows on purchased credit impaired pci loans determines the amount of yield we can recognize in future periods and impacts whether a loan loss reserve must be established for these loans 
we re evaluate the amount and timing of expected cash flows quarterly using updated loan portfolio characteristics as well as assumptions regarding expected borrower default and prepayment behavior 
because estimates of expected future cash flows on pci loans involve assumptions and significant judgment  it is reasonably possible that others could derive different estimates than ours for the same periods 
in addition  changes in estimates from one period to the next can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
a decrease in expected cash flows involving an increase in estimated credit losses would result in an immediate charge to earnings for the recognition of a loan loss provision 
increases or decreases in expected cash flows related solely to changes in estimated prepayments or to changes in variable interest rate indices would result in prospective yield adjustments over the remaining life of the loans 
an increase in expected cash flows due to a reduction in expected credit losses would result first in the reversal of any previously established loan loss reserve on pci loans through an immediate credit to earnings and then  if needed  a prospective adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the loans 
if management used a different estimate of expected borrower defaults  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed 
for example  a increase in the expected borrower default rate of each pci loan pool as of november  could have resulted in an impairment of up to million 
this impairment would have been reflected as an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in the carrying value of the pci loans 
the accounting and estimates used in our calculations are discussed further in note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents net interest income the tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income  net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets 
we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin interest income  net of interest expense  as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interest bearing assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets 
we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources  along with the income generated by our liquidity investment portfolio  on net interest income 
our interest earning assets consist of i loan receivables  ii cash and cash equivalents  which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve  certain highly rated certificates of deposit  and triple a rated government mutual funds  iii restricted cash  iv short term investments and v investment securities 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  both direct to consumer and brokered  and long term borrowings  including amounts owed to securitization investors 
net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables  including the proportion of credit card loans to other consumer loans  as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates  the credit performance of our loans  particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges  which reduce interest income  the terms of long term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering  including maturity and interest rate  the level and composition of other interest bearing assets and liabilities  including our liquidity investment portfolio  changes in the interest rate environment  including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices  such as the prime rate  the federal funds rate and libor  the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program  and the difference between the carrying amount and future cash flows expected to be collected on pci loans 
for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest margin rose slightly for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in this was driven by an increase in yield on our liquidity portfolio  as well as a decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total loans  partially offset by a decline in yield related to loans 
interest income on loan receivables increased during the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november   as an increase in interest income from other consumer loans was partially offset by a decline in interest income from credit card loans 
the increase in interest income from other consumer loans for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of slc during the first quarter of  as well as growth in personal loans 
for the year ended november   the decline in interest income from credit card loans was mostly driven by a decline in yield caused by an increase in promotional rate balances and a decrease in customers who carry a balance on their cards  partially offset by lower interest charge offs 
furthermore  the decline in yield was also impacted by the card act that was implemented in  which led to restrictions on imposing default interest rates on existing balances 
interest income on other interest earning assets  which largely relates to investment income on our liquidity investment portfolio  increased primarily due to a shift in the mix of our liquidity investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of from cash and cash equivalents to investments in securities of the u 
s treasury and us government agencies  which typically have a higher yield than cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense declined in the year ended november  as compared to the same period in this was primarily due to a decline in interest expense related to maturities of deposits bearing higher interest rates 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on securitized borrowings  primarily due to the acquisition of three slc securitization trusts in the first quarter of which have higher funding costs than our credit card securitizations 

table of contents for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest income was billion for the year ended november   a decline of as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
the decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a decline in net interest margin 
net interest margin was for the year ended november   down basis points as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
this reflects a greater proportion of lower rate student loans in our loan portfolio for much of the year  lower rates earned on higher balances in our liquidity investment portfolio and higher rates paid on long term borrowings  partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and an improvement in credit card yield 
yield on credit card loan receivables improved as a result of fewer promotional rate balances and higher interest rates earned on standard balances  partially offset by the impact of legislative changes related to restrictions on increasing interest rates on existing balances beginning in february although the yield on credit card loan receivables was higher for the full year as compared to on a non gaap as adjusted basis  the credit card yield during the fourth quarter was lower than the fourth quarter on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
the level of net interest income also declined during the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis  because of a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables  which was driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate 
this was partially offset by an increase in the level of student loans and a higher average level of liquidity 
interest expense declined slightly for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis largely as a result of lower interest expense on securitized debt and deposits offset by higher expense associated with subordinated debt issuances in late and april interest expense on securitized debt declined because of a significant level of maturities in the first half of interest expense on deposits declined as the decline in deposit interest rates more than offset the higher level of deposit borrowings  which replaced the maturing asset backed securities

provision and allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date 
factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer  including unemployment levels  bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  changes in our loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio  the level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs  the credit quality of the loan portfolio  which reflects  among other factors  our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts  and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance 
in calculating the allowance for loan losses  we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics  such as credit card and other consumer loans 
for consumer loans  we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts which adds an additional element to the identification of loss emergence 
we use these analyses together to determine our allowance for loan losses 

table of contents for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses decreased billion as compared to the year ended november  this decrease was primarily due to improved credit performance  which resulted in a decline in the level of net charge offs  discussed in net charge offs below 
improvements in credit performance were also evidenced by a decline in the delinquency rate for the year  which was the primary driver of the reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
at november   the allowance for loan losses was billion  a decrease of billion from november  for the year ended november   the provision for loan losses decreased billion as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
this decrease was attributable to lower net charge offs and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
the reduction in the allowance for loan losses was due to improved delinquency statistics  which resulted in lower loan loss reserve rates  as well as a billion decline in the level of credit card loans 
more specifically  our allowance at november  was billion  a decline of million as compared to november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
this full year net reduction in the allowance includes a million increase to the allowance in the first quarter upon management s consideration of refined analytics that expanded its ability to identify loss emergence 
at november   the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans increased by million as compared to november  mainly due to the increase in private student loan receivables as well as the seasoning of the loan portfolio 
at november   the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans decreased by million as compared to november  this was largely attributable to a decline in our personal loan reserve rate due to credit improvement in that portfolio 
this was partially offset by a reserve increase related to a higher level of private student loans

see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the accounting for charge offs on pci loans 
the net charge off rate on our credit card loan receivables decreased basis points for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  the decrease in net charge offs was attributable to improvement in both contractual and bankruptcy related charge offs subsequent to a peak in the level of charge offs in the first quarter of furthermore  during the year ended november  there were higher levels of recoveries as compared to the same periods in as relatively few newly originated student loans had entered repayment in  the net charge off rate on student loans remained low in similar to the prior year 
the amount of charge offs on credit card loans decreased for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
the level of contractual and bankruptcy charge offs had peaked by the end of the first quarter of and then declined throughout as a result of improvement in the economic environment 
however  the net charge off rate on our credit card loans increased slightly for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis due to a lower average level of credit card loans 
the seasoning of our personal loan portfolio led to higher charge off amounts during the year ended november  as compared to similar to  there were low levels of student loans in repayment in and thus minimal levels of net charge offs

since a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and aggregate expectation of cash flows  the past due status of a pool  or that of the individual loans within a pool  is not meaningful 
because we are recognizing interest income on a pool of loans  it is all considered to be performing 
information related to credit card loan receivables for years prior to is presented on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
no adjustments have been made for personal loan or private student loan receivables 
see reconciliation in reconciliations of gaap to non gaap as adjusted data 
restructured loans include million  million and million for the years ended november   and  respectively  that are also included in loans over days delinquent or more 
data not available for the years ended november  and both credit card and personal loan receivables delinquency rates at november  have generally declined as compared to november  due to continued improvement in customer financial performance  which has resulted in improvements in both over day and over day delinquency balances 
the decline is also attributable to proactive customer account management 
the rate for over day delinquency balances increased for private student loan balances due to the seasoning of our loan portfolio for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in the rate for over day delinquency balances for private student loan balances was flat for the year ended november  as compared to loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of bankruptcies 
restructured credit card loans at november  increased to billion from million at november  because we began accounting for credit card loans modified through temporary hardship and external programs as troubled debt restructurings during 
table of contents the delinquency rates of credit card loans over day and over day delinquent have both decreased at november  as compared to november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
the delinquency rates on personal loans also experienced improvement in as compared to similar to  the decline in delinquency rates for both credit card and personal loans is due to improvements in customer financial performance and proactive customer account management 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased as compared to november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis  as a result of a decrease in bankruptcy notifications 
restructured loans at november  increased as compared to november  due to the volume that entered a permanent program as a result of an increased focus on collection in maturities and sensitivities of loan receivables to changes in interest rates our loan portfolio had the following maturity distribution at november  dollars in thousands due one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years total credit card loans personal loans private student loans excluding pci pci private student loans other consumer loans total loan portfolio because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns  the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments 
historically  actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and  therefore  the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments 
at november   approximately billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately billion were fixed rate loans 
modified and restructured loans we have loan modification programs that provide for temporary or permanent hardship relief for our credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
the temporary hardship program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction  both lasting for a period no longer than twelve months 
the permanent workout program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than months and reducing the interest rate on the loan 
the permanent programs do not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal  but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments 
we also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources  such as a consumer credit counseling agency program 
these loans continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal  interest or fees 
for additional information regarding the accounting treatment for these loans as well as amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these loans  see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
for student loan borrowers  in certain situations we offer payment forbearance to borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties and are willing to resume making payments 
when a delinquent borrower is granted a second forbearance period  we classify these loans as troubled debt restructurings 
approximately million of loans in our student loan portfolio are considered troubled debt restructurings 
borrower performance after using forbearance is monitored and the method has proven effective in helping to prevent defaults and in assisting customers experiencing temporary financial difficulties 
we plan to continue to use forbearance  and as a result  we expect to have additional loans classified as troubled debt restructurings in the future 
for personal loan customers  in certain situations we offer various payment programs  including temporary and permanent programs 
the temporary programs normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than twelve months with a final balloon payment required at the end of the loan term 
the permanent program involves changing the terms of the loan in order to payoff the outstanding balance over the new term for a period no longer than four years 
the total term may not exceed nine years 
we also allow loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources  similar to our credit card customers discussed above 
payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency 
personal loans included in permanent programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings

the amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customer s outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized as earned 
fee products income increased for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended primarily due to lower chargeoffs related to these products 
fee products income increased slightly for the year ended november   as compared to the year ended november  on a non gaap as adjusted basis primarily due to an increase in revenue from our identity theft protection product 
loan fee income loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late  overlimit  cash advance  pay by phone and other miscellaneous fees 
however  as a result of legislative changes that became effective in  we no longer charge overlimit or pay by phone fees on consumer credit card loans and additional legislative changes also resulted in modifications to our late fee policy beginning august loan fee income was flat for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  although late fees decreased in due to the modifications discussed above  this was offset by higher overlimit fees in as there was a heightened amount of overlimit fee charge offs in although there was no material income relating to overlimit fees during  there was a significant amount of overlimit fees that were delinquent in february and were subsequently charged off 
in  loan fee income decreased substantially as compared to on a non gaap as adjusted basis  primarily due to the legislative changes mentioned above 
we had a minimal level of overlimit fees in as compared to million in on a non gaap as adjusted basis  which was the last year in which we charged overlimit fees throughout the entire year overlimit fees were million in on a gaap basis 
additionally  our late fee income declined by million in as compared to on a non gaap as adjusted basis 
this was due in part to the legislative changes mentioned above  but also due to a higher level of late payment incidences in as a result of the credit environment at that time 
merchant fees to broaden merchant acceptance of discover network cards  we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late we have also sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs 
as we have moved away from direct merchant relationships  our merchant fee income and related costs have declined to million in as compared to million in and million in the lower income per transaction is generally offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance 
transaction processing revenue transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing atm  debit and point of sale transactions over the pulse network  as well as various participation and membership fees 
switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis 
transaction processing revenue increased for as compared to  as well as for compared to  primarily due to continued higher transaction volumes at pulse partially offset by increased business development costs

total other expense increased million in as compared to this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of slc  growth and infrastructure investments made to expand the loan portfolio  network acceptance and deposits  and the associated impacts on headcount and compensation 
increased marketing and business development costs were primarily driven by higher investments in new credit card account acquisitions and new originations in student and personal loans enabled by the strong credit performance experienced in professional fees increased due to higher costs related to key technology and growth initiatives  along with costs related to the slc acquisition and higher costs related to recovering charged off accounts 
other expense increased compared to prior year due to higher fraud related costs and an increase in legal reserves related to pending litigation

employee compensation and benefits expense decreased as we reduced our cost base under uncertain economic conditions in and into information processing and communications expense was lower in than in due to our efforts to reduce costs associated with ongoing contracts 
other expense was lower in due to i a million nonrecurring benefit discussed above  ii a million restructuring charge recorded during the second quarter as a result of the reduction in headcount and iii a million decline in costs relating to fraud 
these declines in expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses  due to increased advertising and promotional marketing expenses and higher investments in account acquisition  and an increase in professional fees  due to higher collection fees and advisory expenses related to the acquisition of slc

table of contents liquidity and capital resources funding and liquidity we seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations 
in addition  we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile and utilize a cost effective mix of funding sources 
our primary funding sources include deposits  sourced directly from consumers or through brokers  term asset backed securitizations  private asset backed securitizations and long term borrowings 
funding sources deposits 
we offer deposit products  including certificates of deposit  money market accounts  online savings accounts and individual retirement account ira certificates of deposit  to customers through two channels i through direct marketing  internet origination and affinity relationships direct to consumer deposits  and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits 
at november   we had billion of direct to consumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits 
maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to ten years  with a weighted average maturity of months at november  the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity as of november  dollars in thousands total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months certificates of deposit in amounts less than  certificates of deposit in amounts of  to less than certificates of deposit in amounts of  or greater savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts total interest bearing deposits  represents the basic insurance amount previously covered by the fdic 
effective july   the basic insurance per depositor was permanently increased to  credit card securitization financing 
we use the securitization of credit card receivables as an additional source of funding 
we access the asset backed securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent  through which we issue asset backed securities both publicly and through private transactions 
the dcmt structure utilizes class a and class b certificates held by third parties  with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated class b certificates  cash collateral accounts and subordinated series ce 
the dcent structure utilizes four classes of securities with declining levels of seniority class a  b  c and d  with credit enhancement provided by the more subordinated classes of notes 
we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the seller s interest and subordinated security classes of dcmt and dcent 
the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
we refer to this as economic early amortization  which is based on excess spread levels 
excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period  including interest collections  fees and interchange  exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period  including interest expense  servicing fees and charged off receivables 
our excess spread previously included the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from series sd  which enhanced securities of both dcmt and dcent 
series sd matured on january   and as prescribed in amendments to the governing documents which became effective in january  the size of the class d note was increased 
in the event of an economic early amortization  which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a three month rolling average basis  we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received 
an early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity  and require us to utilize our available non securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources  which may or may not be available at the time 
as of november   the month rolling 
table of contents average excess spread was  however  the maturity of series sd on january  will have the effect of somewhat reducing the trusts excess spread in periods thereafter 
another feature of our securitization structure  which is applicable only to the notes issued from dcent  is a reserve account funding requirement in which  in limited circumstances  excess cash flows generated by the transferred loan receivables are held at the trust 
this funding requirement is triggered when dcent s three month average excess spread rate decreases to below  with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels to 
see note credit card and student loan securitization activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the structures of dcmt and dcent and for tables providing information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at november  at november   we had billion of outstanding public asset backed securities  billion of outstanding private asset backed securitizations and billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries at november  dollars in thousands total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of long term borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors at november   we had capacity to issue up to billion in triple a rated asset backed securities from dcent without the issuance of additional class b or class c notes as subordination 
the triple a rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based  in part  on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic  as conservator or receiver  will not  using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts  seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap 
pursuant to amendments to gaap related to transfers of financial assets  effective for us on december   certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities including discover bank s transfers of assets to the dcmt no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment 
however  on september   the fdic approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts  including the dcmt  so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december  other legislative and regulatory developments  namely the proposed sec regulation ab ii including the sec s july reproposal of certain of its provisions  the august sec advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the rule exempting securitization entities from being regarded as investment companies under the investment company act of  the securitization and rating agency provisions of the reform act and the rules promulgated or proposed thereunder  including proposed rules requiring us to retain risk in our securitization on an unhedged basis  may  however  impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
short term borrowings 
we primarily access short term borrowings through the federal funds market or through repurchase agreements 
in the past two years  we have rarely used short term borrowings  however  we have recently been borrowing overnight federal funds on an opportunistic basis 
total short term borrowings as of november  were million and the weighted average interest rate was 
information about our use of short term borrowings for the year ended november  is shown in the table below dollars in thousands november  maximum daily balance during the period overnight federal funds purchased overnight repurchase agreements corporate and bank debt 
at november   we had million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding and discover bank had billion in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding 
our senior unsecured notes are comprised of two issuances  each million in principal amount  with one issuance maturing in june and the other issuance maturing in july the senior unsecured notes would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade 
discover bank s subordinated notes are comprised of one million issuance due in november and a million issuance due in april for more information  see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other long term borrowings student loans 
at november   we had million of funding related to federal student loans  which are currently held for sale  and billion of funding related to private student loans 
we obtained million of funding in april  of which million is still outstanding as of november   through an agreement with an asset backed commercial paper conduit sponsored by the us department of education under the ensuring continued access to student loans act of however  upon sale of the related federal student loans  this loan facility will be repaid or assumed by the buyer 
we assumed billion principal amount outstanding of securitization debt in december as part of the slc acquisition  of which billion remained outstanding as of november  principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time 
additional funding sources private asset backed securitizations 
we have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset backed securitizations to support the funding of our credit card loan receivables 
under these arrangements  we had used million of capacity and had undrawn capacity of billion at november  federal reserve 
discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
as of november   discover bank had billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount of assets pledged 
we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets  including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt  may be affected by the credit ratings of discover financial services  discover bank and the securitization trusts 
downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations 
in addition to increased funding costs  deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets 
we also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require discover bank s debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies 
if discover bank s credit rating is reduced to below investment grade  we would be required to post additional collateral  which  as of november   would have been million 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

several rating agencies have announced that they will be evaluating the effects of the reform act in order to determine the extent  if any  to which financial institutions  including us  may be negatively impacted 
while we are currently unaware of any negative actions  there is no assurance that our credit ratings could not be downgraded in the future as a result of any such reviews

table of contents liquidity management we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations  fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under normal and stress conditions 
in addition to the funding sources discussed above  we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our investment portfolio 
we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity 
regular liquidity stress testing and contingency funding planning is performed as part of our liquidity management process 
we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 
these scenarios measure the liquidity position over a two year horizon by analyzing the stress on liquidity versus ability to generate contingent liquidity 
we maintain contingent funding sources  including our liquidity portfolio  private securitizations with unused capacity and federal reserve discount window capacity  which we could utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events 
we expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during the next months by utilizing our deposit channels  credit card asset backed securitizations and our contingent funding sources 
we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business  which is the responsibility of our asset and liability committee the alco 
we seek to balance the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity  which may limit financial flexibility and be costly  with having too little liquidity that could cause financial distress 
liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco  which is chaired by our treasurer and has cross functional membership 
the alco monitors positions and determines any actions that need to be taken 
at november   our liquidity portfolio was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality  liquid investment securities 
cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the federal reserve 
investment securities included credit card asset backed securities of other issuers and us treasury  us government agency and aaa rated corporate debt obligations issued under the temporary liquidity guarantee program that are guaranteed by the fdic  all of which are considered highly liquid 
in addition  we have the ability to raise cash by utilizing repurchase agreements and pledging certain of these investments

capital our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by our businesses and issuances in the capital markets 
we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses  meet regulatory requirements  adhere to rating agency guidelines and support future business growth 
within these constraints  we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders 
the level  composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment  strategic initiatives  and legislative and regulatory developments 
under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the fdic  the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies  we  along with discover bank  must maintain minimum levels of capital 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results 
we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance 
we maintain a substantial deferred tax asset on our balance sheet  and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels 
however  for regulatory capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income are currently limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on our projected future taxable income for that year  or ii of the amount of our tier capital 
at november   no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 
at november   discover financial services and discover bank met the requirements for well capitalized status  exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under basel i 
current or future regulatory initiatives may require us to hold more capital in the future 
in december  the federal reserve issued proposed rules to implement heightened prudential standards for large bank holding companies  including us  as required by the reform act  including risk based capital and leverage standards 
in november  the federal reserve issued a final rule requiring the submission of annual capital plans to the federal reserve for its review and non objection 
the instructions accompanying the federal reserve s final rule regarding capital plans also indicate that the federal reserve expects covered companies to show that they can achieve readily and without difficulty the ratios required by the basel iii framework as they would come into effect in the united states

the amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital levels  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors 
in addition  banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases 
for example  our ability to make capital distributions  including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock  is subject to the federal reserve s review and non objection of our annual capital plan 
in certain circumstances  we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the federal reserve has approved such distribution

our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of november  are summarized below dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years more than five years deposits borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases interest payments on fixed rate debt purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual obligations deposits do not include interest charges 
see note borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be million as of november   utilizing the current interest rates as of that date 
purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorship  software license  telecommunications agreements and global acceptance contracts 
purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants 
purchase obligations at november  reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition 
other liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans  discover bank s agreement with citi to purchase private student loans and the contingent liability associated with our equity method securities 
as of november  our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and approximately million of accrued interest and penalties 
since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty  as addressed in asc topic  income taxes  guidance formerly provided by fasb interpretation no 
 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations 
we extend credit for consumer and commercial loans  primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other consumer loan products  such as student loans  provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement 
at november   our unused commitments were billion 
these commitments  substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties 
the activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to its acquisition by discover bank on december   slc had an agreement with citi providing for the origination and servicing of private student loans 
citi would originate and fund such loans and  after final disbursement  slc would purchase the loans from citi 
this agreement between slc and citi was terminated on december   at which time discover bank entered into an agreement with citi to purchase i eligible private student loans originated by citi prior to december  and ii any private student loans originated by citi on or after december  under a new loan origination agreement entered into between citi and slc on december  discover bank has agreed to purchase the loans at the funded amount plus accrued interest and less any capitalized fees for any loans first funded prior to december  and  for any loans first funded by citi on december  or later  pay a premium equal to 
discover bank 
table of contents completed the first purchase of loan participations under this agreement on january  the agreement has been amended to extend to december   and was effective upon the closing of discover bank s purchase of private student loans from citi on september  although the agreement does not set forth a minimum or maximum amount of loans to be purchased  discover bank must purchase all eligible loans originated by citi  which the company estimates to be billion to billion over the life of the agreement  as amended 
as of november   discover bank had an outstanding commitment to purchase million of loans under this agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk 
we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers  as well as invest in other assets and our business 
these loans and other assets earn interest  which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed 
our net interest income and  therefore  earnings  will be negatively affected if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than increases to the interest rate we owe on our borrowings 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates  loan balances or deposit account activity 
we may face higher cost alternative sources of funding as a result  which has the potential to decrease earnings 
our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the mix of variable and fixed rate assets 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve our objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or liability from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate 
see note derivatives and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity 
we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from our reporting date  we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously  simultaneously and to the same degree 
our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio 
due to recently enacted credit card legislation  we now have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances 
at november   the majority of our credit card and student loans were at variable rates 
assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are considered to be rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index  such as federal funds or libor  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  also are considered to be rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimate that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimated that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
we have not provided an estimate of any impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels ie  prime and libor and  therefore  could not materially decrease further
