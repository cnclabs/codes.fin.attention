item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill reclamation costs pension and other postretirement benefits environmental compliance claims and litigation including self insurance income taxes we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates  however  these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
economic political risks both commercial and residential construction are dependent upon the overall us economy which has been recovering at a slow pace commercial and residential construction levels generally move with economic cycles 
when the economy is strong  construction levels rise and when the economy is weak  construction levels fall 
the overall us economy has been adversely affected by this recession 
although most economists believe that the us economy is now in recovery  the pace of recovery has been very slow 
since construction activity generally lags the recovery after down cycles  construction projects have not returned to their pre recession levels 
above average number of foreclosures  low housing starts and general weakness in the housing market could continue to negatively affect demand for our products in most of our markets  particularly florida and california  sales volumes have been negatively impacted by foreclosures and a significant decline in residential construction 
our sales volumes and earnings could continue to be depressed and negatively impacted by this segment of the market until the recovery in residential construction improves 
lack of a multi year federal highway bill and changes to the funding mechanism for highway funding could cause states to spend less on roads which may negatively impact our revenues the last multi year federal transportation bill  known as safetea lu  expired on september  since that time  funding for transportation projects  including highways  has been provided by a series of continuing resolutions 
the current continuing resolution expires on march  additionally  in january the us house of representatives passed a new rules package that repealed a longstanding point of order that had protected annual authorized highway funding levels from amendments that could subsequently reduce such authorized levels 
the rule change could potentially result in an authorized level of funding being subsequently reduced at some point in the legislative process 
both the lack of a multi year bill and the change in the funding mechanism increases the uncertainty regarding funds for highway projects 
this uncertainty could result in state departments of transportation failing to undertake large multi year highway projects which could  in turn  negatively affect our sales 
changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning  land use  environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities  a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures our operations are affected by numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations related to zoning  land use and environmental matters 
despite our compliance efforts  we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business 
these potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 
in addition  our operations are subject to environmental  zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits  which often require us to make significant capital and maintenance and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements 
stricter laws and regulations  or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations  may impose new liabilities on us  reduce operating hours  require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment  or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities

table of contents climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
such legislation or regulation  if enacted  potentially could include provisions for a cap and trade system of allowances and credits  among other provisions 
the environmental protection agency epa promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering greenhouse gas emissions from sources considered to be large emitters 
the epa has also promulgated a greenhouse gas emissions permitting rule  referred to as the tailoring rule  which requires permitting of large emitters of greenhouse gases under the federal clean air act 
we have determined that our newbery cement plant is subject to both the reporting rule and the permitting rule  although the impacts of the permitting rule are uncertain at this time 
the first required greenhouse gas emissions report for the newberry cement plant was submitted to the epa on march  other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events  shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities  and potential impacts from sea level changes 
there is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity 
the impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate 
however  climate change and legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
growth and competitive risks within our local markets  we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices  volumes and costs the construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets 
additionally  in most markets  we also compete against large private and public companies  some of which are more vertically integrated than we are 
therefore  there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate 
this significant competition could lead to lower prices  lower sales volumes and higher costs in some markets  negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows 
in certain markets  vertically integrated competitors have acquired a portion of our asphalt mix and ready mixed concrete customers and this trend may accelerate 
our long term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas 
if we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our earnings in the future construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and  therefore  difficult to transport efficiently 
because of the nature of the products  the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs 
therefore  except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail  barge or ship  the markets for our products tend to be very localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck 
new quarry sites often take a number of years to develop  therefore our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth 
additionally  in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate  it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance 
therefore  our future success is dependent  in part  on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites 
our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions  it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings the expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves 
disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions 
additionally  with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete  our future results will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations 
personnel risks our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel  particularly in sales and operations a significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel 
our success in attracting qualified personnel  particularly in the areas of sales and operations  is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions  the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions  and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages 
part i 
table of contents the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have risen in recent years 
continuing increases in such costs could negatively affect our earnings the costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits to our employees have increased substantially over the past several years 
we have instituted measures to help slow the rate of increase 
however  if these costs continue to rise  we could suffer an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other risks weather can materially affect our operating results almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry  and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors 
inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers short term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather 
therefore  our financial results can be negatively affected by inclement weather 
our products are transported by truck  rail  barge or ship  often by third party providers 
significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail  barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets 
the costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control  including rail service interruptions or rate increases  tariffs  rising fuel costs and capacity constraints 
additionally  inclement weather  including hurricanes  tornadoes and other weather events  can negatively impact our distribution network 
we use large amounts of electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation  which could affect our operating results and profitability in our production and distribution processes  we consume significant amounts of electricity  diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based resources 
the availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control 
our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability 
variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability 
we are involved in a number of legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty we are involved in several complex litigation proceedings  some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our chemicals business 
although we divested our chemicals business in june  we retained certain liabilities related to the business 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time 
subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency  and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
