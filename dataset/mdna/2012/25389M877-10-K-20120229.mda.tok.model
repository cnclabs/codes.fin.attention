item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services 
our products and services support a wide variety of uses  including defense  intelligence and homeland security applications  mapping and analysis  environmental monitoring  oil and gas exploration  and infrastructure management 
our principal customers are governments  including us and foreign defense and intelligence  and civil agencies and providers of location based services lbs 
additionally we serve a wide variety of companies in other vertical markets  such as energy  telecommunications  utility  forestry  mining  environmental and agricultural industries 
the imagery that forms the foundation of our products and services is collected daily via our three high resolution imaging satellites and managed in our content archive  which we refer to as our 
table of contents imagelibrary 
we believe our imagelibrary is the largest  most up to date and comprehensive archive of high resolution earth imagery commercially available  containing more than billion square kilometers of imagery  with new imagery added every day 
as of december   our collection capacity was approximately million square kilometers of imagery per year or roughly six times the earth s land surface area and offers intraday revisit around the globe 
revision of previously issued financial statements in connection with the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   errors were identified primarily relating to the year ended december  and the first three quarters of the year ended december  these errors were primarily related to the company s accounting for the direct access program dap  as described below 
the company has assessed the impact of these errors on each period involved  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 and has determined that the impact of the errors was not material  both individually and in the aggregate  to all previously issued financial statements 
while the company has also determined that the cumulative effect of correcting the errors in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  would not be material to the consolidated financial statements  the company has elected to revise its previously issued financial statements to facilitate comparisons among periods 
as part of its revision  the company has determined to reverse immaterial out of period adjustments that were previously recorded in the company s quarterly periods and to reflect those adjustments as corrections to the periods in which the errors originated 
the following is a description of the nature and the amount of the errors relating to the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the impact on the and quarterly financial information in three of the company s four current dap customer contracts  the up front payments contractually negotiated for the facility were less than the actual third party costs to manufacture the facility 
as each of the three facilities was brought into service  it was the company s accounting policy to amortize both the deferred revenue and deferred contracts costs over the estimated customer relationship periods  which periods are consistent with the estimated remaining useful life of the satellite being accessed 
however  the company has concluded that this accounting policy was in error and that it should have been recognizing the deferred contract costs in excess of the deferred revenues for each individual customer over the related initial contract period 
the impact of this error is an increase in cost of revenue of million 
certain costs for two dap customers were previously netted against the related revenue 
however  the company concluded that this was an error as the company acts as the principal in these arrangements 
the cost and revenue should have been recorded on a gross basis  with the effect being an increase in both revenue and cost of revenue of million 
the company incorrectly capitalized interest related to the construction of its direct access facilities and other discrete projects 
the impact of this error is an increase to interest expense of million 
the company previously recognized maintenance revenue for one dap customer over a one year period 
however  the company concluded that this was an error and that the revenue should have been recognized over the customer relationship period 
the impact of this error is to reduce revenue by million 
the company incorrectly calculated certain dap access minutes 
the impact of this error is to reduce revenue by million 
the company has also corrected other immaterial errors including i over or under capitalization of certain internal and external costs  ii the accounting for stock compensation  including under capitalization of stock compensation for certain assets under construction  iii the effects of properly reconciling certain accrued liability accounts  and iv the classification of payments received for a sales type lease from operating to investing cash flows 

table of contents products and services we offer earth imagery products and services that are comprised of imagery from our three high resolution satellite constellation as well as aerial and satellite imagery that we acquire from third party suppliers 
we process our imagery to varying levels according to our customers specifications and deliver our products using the distribution methods that best suit our customers needs 
customers can purchase satellite or aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary  or by placing custom orders  which require tasking of our satellites  for a specific area of interest  or as a bundle of imagery and data for a region or type of location  such as cities  ports and harbors or airports 
for example  our global basemap product features comprehensive color imagery of the earth s surface that is refreshed on a routine basis and is delivered to customers according to geographic need 
our imagelibrary currently houses what we believe to be the most comprehensive  up to date  high resolution archive of commercial earth imagery in the world 
it is a collection of substantially all imagery acquired by our quickbird  worldview and worldview satellites  whether tasked for a specific customer or collected on a speculative basis  as well as aerial imagery and other satellite imagery we have purchased to supplement our satellite imagery 
we collect and store hundreds of thousands of high resolution imagery scenes covering over billion square kilometers in the imagelibrary 
approximately of our revenue  excluding the nga sla  is generated from purchases from our imagelibrary 
customers specify how they want the imagery content that they are purchasing from us to be produced 
we deliver our satellite imagery content at three processing levels i basic imagery with the least amount of processing  ii standard imagery with radiometric and geometric correction  and iii ortho rectified imagery with radiometric  geometric  and topographic correction 
radiometric correction enables images to appear uniformly illuminated with the right level of brightness 
geometric correction allows a user to identify the latitudinal  longitudinal and altitudinal location of any point in an image 
topographic correction accounts for terrain and projects images onto the earth as they would be seen by the human eye 
all of our aerial imagery is delivered as ortho rectified imagery 
we also use enhanced processing to produce mosaic and stereo imagery products 
the mosaic process takes multiple imagery scenes  collected at different times and dates  and merges them into a single seamless imagery product 
we use specialized collection and enhanced processing to produce stereo imagery products 
stereo imagery products consist of two images collected from two different viewpoints along the satellite orbit track that are produced as basic products  but can be viewed in stereo d using specialized software 
stereo imagery products are used for the creation of digital elevation maps  for the more accurate creation of d maps and flight simulations 
we offer a range of on and off line distribution options designed to enable customers to easily access and integrate our imagery into their business operations and applications 
delivery options include desktop software applications  web services that provide for direct on line access to our imagelibrary  file transfer protocol ftp  and physical media such as cd  dvd  and hard drive 
we offer an additional distribution option through our direct access program dap that allows certain customers  approved by the us government  to task and download data directly from our worldview and worldview satellites within their regional area of interest 
dap is designed to meet the enhanced information and operational security needs of a select and limited number of defense and intelligence customers and certain commercial customers 
to date  we have signed five customer contracts for our dap  four of whom have been operational since the second half of the fifth customer is currently expected to come online in the first half of we sell our products and services through a combination of direct and indirect channels  a global network of resellers  strategic partners  direct enterprise sales and web services 
we generated of our revenue through direct sales and of our revenue from our reseller and partner network 

table of contents significant customer in september  we entered into the nextview agreement with the national geospatial intelligence agency nga under which we agreed to provide a minimum of million of imagery products and services from our worldview satellite 
of this amount  million was received between september and november  the date worldview became operational  and was used to offset the construction costs of the satellite 
the remaining million commitment was to be received upon the delivery of imagery once worldview achieved full operational capability foc 
in january  we amended the nextview agreement from image based ordering to a service level agreement sla and increased the amount we received under the nextview agreement from million to million nextview sla 
on june   the nextview sla agreement was further amended to extend the term from july  through march  in consideration for payment of an additional million  payable at million per month during the extended term 
on february  the nextview agreement was amended to provide nga with an option to extend the agreement for three months on the same terms from april  to june  and six additional options each for a one month period with the last option term expiring on december  on march   nga exercised the option to extend through june  on june   nga exercised its first monthly option to extend through july   and on july  exercised its second monthly option to extend through august  the nextview sla expired august  on august   we entered into the enhancedview contract with nga 
the sla portion of the enhancedview contract  enhancedview sla has an effective date of september   commencing upon the expiration of the nextview sla 
the enhancedview contract has a ten year term  inclusive of nine one year options exercisable by nga  and is subject to congressional appropriations and the federal budget process  and the right of nga to terminate or suspend the contract at any time 
for a discussion of the risk associated with our government contracts  see risk factors in part  item a 
the enhancedview sla portion of the award is sized at billion over the term of the contract assuming nga exercises all of its options and we perform as specified  million annually  or million per month  for the first four contract years  commencing september   with an increase to million annually  or million per month  for the remaining six years of the contract term 
the award also provides for up to million for value added products  infrastructure enhancements and other services  including the option for nga to require us to lower the altitude of worldview to an altitude of km at any time after september  we will be required to meet certain service level requirements related to the operational performance of the satellites comprising the worldview constellation and related ground systems 
to support requirements under this agreement  we have begun the procurement and construction of our next satellite  worldview  as well as certain other infrastructure improvements 
we recognize revenue for the billion in services to be provided under the enhancedview sla using a proportional performance method based upon the estimated capacity of our constellation made available to nga compared to the total capacity to be provided over the life of the contract 
the contract requires us to increase capacity of the constellation through the installation of additional remote ground terminals  which communicate directly with our satellites  as well as the addition of an entirely new satellite  worldview our worldview satellite is expected to be ready for launch in mid as capacity is added to our constellation  we recognize revenue in direct proportion to the amount of incremental capacity that is made available to nga 
commencing in september  we recognized approximately million of revenue monthly through august   under the enhancedview sla 
as of september   we increased the capacity of the constellation made available to nga and are now recognizing approximately million per month under the enhancedview sla 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of revenue and recorded million of deferred revenue related to the enhancedview sla contract 
as of december   there was million in total deferred revenue from the inception of the enhancedview sla 
given the significant amount of constellation capacity expected to be generated by worldview satellite and the increasing percentage of capacity that nga will acquire from us once worldview satellite becomes operational  we anticipate a material increase in revenue once worldview satellite reaches foc 

table of contents under the enhancedview sla  and assuming all option years under the agreement are exercised and funded  we will receive a consistent  monthly non refundable cash payment of approximately million from nga during the first four years of the enhancedview contract  with an increase to million per month in years five through ten 
each month is subject to a holdback  up to of the monthly payment scheduled  depending upon our performance against pre defined criteria 
if we have been certified as having performed all requirements in the agreement each month  no holdback will be applied to that month 
if funds are held back  we retain the cash  however  those funds can be applied to future products and services or will fund a pro rated extension beyond the current contract period 
accordingly  all amounts held back will cause us to defer recognition of a corresponding revenue amount until such additional products or services have been provided 
from september  to december   we satisfied all performance criteria under the agreement  and therefore had no holdback applied for the period 
during the year ended december   there was million of holdback  which occurred during the first quarter of  all of which has been applied to other products and recognized as revenue as of december  revenue our principal source of revenue is the licensing of our earth imagery products and services to end users and resellers and partners 
we conduct our business through two segments i defense and intelligence  and ii commercial 
we have organized our business into these two segments because we believe that customers in these two groups are functionally similar in terms of their areas of focus and purchasing habits 
our imagery products and services are comprised of imagery that we process to varying levels according to the customer s specifications 
we deliver our products and services using the distribution method that best suits our customers needs 
customers can purchase satellite or aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary 
customers can also order imagery content by placing custom orders  which require tasking of our satellites  for a specific area of interest  or as a bundle of imagery and data for a region or type of location  such as cities  ports and harbors or airports 
year ended december  revised in millions revenue defense and intelligence commercial total revenue revenue as a percent of total defense and intelligence commercial total revenue total us and foreign sales were as follows year ended december  revised in millions revenue us foreign total revenue 
table of contents defense and intelligence revenue our defense and intelligence segment consists of customers who are principally defense and intelligence agencies of us or foreign governments 
the us government  through nga  purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various entities within the us government  including the military commands and other government agencies 
we also sell to other us defense and intelligence customers including defense and intelligence contractors who provide an additional outlet for our imagery by providing value added services with our imagery to deliver a final end product to a customer 
our defense and intelligence customers focus on image quality  including resolution  frequency of area revisit and coverage  as well as ensuring availability of a certain amount of our capacity as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning 
our customers in this segment typically operate under contracts with purchase commitments  through which we receive monthly or quarterly payments in exchange for delivering specific orders to the customer 
our revenue from our defense and intelligence customers has historically been largely from tasking orders  with a smaller portion from sales of imagery from our imagelibrary 
we believe this trend will continue 
we sell to our defense and intelligence customers both directly and through resellers 
only one dap customer had been commissioned in by the second half of  we commissioned four of our current dap customers ground terminals and began generating revenue from providing satellite access time to these customers 
these four dap customers generated revenue for the entire year of the fifth dap customer is currently expected to come online in the first half of we earn revenue from sales of the dap facility hardware and software  as well as service fees to access our satellite constellation 
the revenues to access our satellite constellation are recognized over time based on minutes of actual usage 
the revenues and costs associated with the sales of a dap facility are deferred until we commission into operation the ground terminal and can provide contractually specified access to our operational satellites 
the revenues and costs are then recognized ratably over the customer relationship period  which is based on the estimated useful life of the satellite being accessed  except when deferred contract costs are in excess of deferred revenues  in which case the excess costs are recognized over the initial contract period 
if more than one satellite is used  the satellite with the longest remaining useful life is used as the basis for the amortization

table of contents commercial revenue our commercial segment consists of both traditional and location based services customers 
our traditional customers are primarily civil government agencies  and energy  telecommunications  utility and agricultural companies who  like our defense and intelligence customers  use our content for mapping  monitoring  analysis and planning activities 
providers of lbs  include internet portals  connected devices  and digital mapmakers  who use our imagery products and services to expand their products and services 
customers in other industry verticals are represented by financial services  oil and gas  telecommunications  utilities  environmental services and other industry verticals who use our imagery in a wide range of applications 
our commercial customers are located throughout the world 
they purchase our products and services on an as needed basis  or through multi year contracts  depending on the solution that best suits their application 
we sell to these customers directly and through resellers 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated approximately of our commercial revenue from paid tasking and from our imagelibrary 
for the years ended december   and  our top five commercial customers accounted for  and of our commercial revenue 
we believe that we will have additional growth opportunities internationally especially in countries with rapidly developing economies  such as brazil  china and russia  and  as a result  we expect that long term sales growth in our commercial segment will be higher outside of the united states 
year ended december  revised in millions commercial revenue americas international total commercial revenue revenue as a percent of total americas revenue international revenue reseller and direct sales direct sales resellers expenses most of our revenue is generated by the sale of products and services comprised of imagery from our quickbird  worldview and worldview satellites 
given that most of the costs of a satellite are related to the pre operation capital expenditures required to build and launch a satellite  there is no significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel  as well as the cost of operations directly associated with operating our satellites  retrieving information from the satellites  and processing the data retrieved 
costs of acquiring aerial imagery from third parties are capitalized and amortized on an accelerated basis as a cost of revenue 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor  benefits  travel  rent  insurance  utilities  telecommunications and related overhead costs  third party consultant payments  sales commissions and marketing expenses 
our total selling  general and administrative expenses have been increasing in recent years  and we expect the increase in costs to continue  as we expand our sales and administrative resources to enable our revenue growth and increase capacity for product sales and distribution 

table of contents the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses may be offset in future years by the capitalization of labor costs incurred in the development of new assets  especially during the construction of a new satellite 
with the initiation of worldview satellite and other capital investments related to the enhancedview program  we anticipate we will be capitalizing increasing amounts of direct labor costs that are associated with the development of these programs 
depreciation and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our satellites and other operating assets 
on january   when the worldview satellite reached foc  we began depreciating this asset at a rate of approximately million each quarter 
our interest charges consist primarily of interest payments on borrowings used to finance satellite construction and are capitalized as a cost of our satellite construction 
during  all interest incurred was capitalized to our worldview satellite and other assets under construction 
with the successful commissioning of worldview  the total capitalized interest amount was significantly smaller in  increasing our interest expense 
during  with the increase in capital projects  including worldview our capitalized interest expense has increased  decreasing our interest expense 
based on our capitalization policies  we expect our future interest expense to decrease due to capitalization of these costs to the construction of our worldview satellite and other infrastructure  until the anticipated commissioning of worldview in the costs of our satellites include capitalized interest costs incurred during the construction and development period of the satellite 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellites and related ground systems include internal direct labor costs incurred in their construction

the increase of million in commercial revenue to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   was due to a million increase in revenue from location based services customers in the americas and a million increase in international sales  primarily in europe 
cost of revenue increased million or  during the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributed to i a million increase in costs related to ground system operations due to the addition of four remote ground terminals brought into service during the year per the enhancedview contract  ii a million increase in labor related costs due to headcount growth and iii a million increase in deferred contract costs amortization as all four direct access facilities were operational for the full year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs increased million or  for the year ended december   to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to i a million increase in labor related costs  of which million was a one time  non cash stock compensation expense related to the departure of the prior ceo  ii a million increase in bad debt expense  primarily for two delinquent customers in asia  iii a million increase in consulting services  and iv a million increase in general software and maintenance fees 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in costs to insure our satellite constellation  primarily due to reduced insurance premiums for worldview as the satellite was in the second year of operation and benefitted from lower on orbit insurance 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million for the year ended december   to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to extending the life of the quickbird satellite during the second quarter of future changes in depreciation and amortization could be affected by commissioning of a new satellite  change in useful life of an existing satellite  or introduction of significant new capital assets 

table of contents interest expense  net of capitalized interest  decreased by million for the year ended december  to million from million during the year ended december  this decrease is attributed to approximately of our interest being capitalized to capital projects during the year ended december  as compared to in this increase is attributable to the construction in progress of our worldview satellite  which began during the third quarter of and is currently expected to continue until anticipated launch and commission of worldview in we anticipate that an increasing percentage of our interest will be capitalized until the worldview satellite is launched 
the benefit from income taxes in  is primarily due to loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
for the year ended december   we had an effective overall tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes and the effects of non deductible stock based compensation

the million increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to million of amortization of deferred contract costs arising from the construction  implementation and maintenance of the dap facilities and a million increase in subcontracting costs 
the cost of revenue increase also includes a million increase in labor related costs  primarily driven by headcount growth as well as the cost of employee labor which had previously been capitalized as part of the worldview development  but which has now been reallocated to other operating functions within the company 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in amortization of the purchased aerial imagery library 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative costs is attributable to a million increase in labor related costs  primarily driven by headcount growth as well as expensing of employee labor cost that previously had been capitalized as a part of worldview development 
other increases in selling  general and administrative costs include an increase of million from costs related to insuring worldview  an increase of million in consulting costs  a million increase in bonus expense due to increased headcount and a million increase in legal and accounting services 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in stock compensation expense  a million decrease in bad debt expense and a million decrease in third party commission expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  as compared to  primarily due to the commissioning of worldview on january  the worldview satellite is being depreciated over years and the incremental depreciation is approximately million per quarter 
interest expense  net was million  an increase from due to the commissioning of the worldview satellite on january   which resulted in the expensing of substantially all of the interest on our debt during approximately six percent of our interest was capitalized on capital projects during during the third quarter of  we started the construction of the worldview satellite  thus we expect our capital expenditures to increase in future reporting periods  resulting in more of our interest being capitalized 
the decrease in income tax is primarily due to a decrease in pre tax income 
for the year ended december   we had an effective overall tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differed from the 
table of contents statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes and the effects of non deductible stock based compensation 
balance sheet measures total assets increased million  or  from  million at december  to  million at december  total assets increased primarily as a result of an increase in property and equipment of million  from million at december  to  million at december  the increase in property and equipment results from an increase in worldview satellite construction and other infrastructure projects 
the increase in aerial image library costs from million at december  to million at december   is due to receipt of imagery acquired from a third party provider 
cash and cash equivalents increased million due to additional debt borrowings offset by increases in operating costs and increased capital expenditures related to world view total liabilities increased million  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was due to a net million increase in long term deferred revenue from million at december  to at december  primarily due to payments received from nga under the enhancedview sla  offset by the recognition of the pre foc payments received under the nextview agreement 
the company entered into a new debt facility on october   increasing our long term debt million  from million at december  to million at december  total accounts payable  other accrued liabilities and long term accrued liabilities increased by million from million at december  to million at december  the increase is primarily related to the timing of accruals for milestone payments on capital projects 
accrued interest decreased million from million at december  to million at december   due to the timing of interest payments under the new credit facility entered into in october of liquidity and capital resources we believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for the next twelve months 
our nextview agreement with nga was replaced by the enhancedview agreement which was signed during august we cannot assure you that the us government will continue to purchase earth imagery or other services from us at similar levels or similar terms 
all of our contracts with the us government agencies are subject to risks of termination or reduction in scope due to changes in us government policies and priorities  or reduced congressional funding level commitments 
pursuant to the contract terms  us government agencies can terminate  modify or suspend our contracts at any time with or without cause 
the us government accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  if the us government were not to renew or extend our contract at similar levels or similar terms  we believe we would be able to maintain operations at a reduced level with existing cash and cash equivalents for the next twelve months 
in summary  our cash flows were revised in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the million decrease in operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in net income due to the loss on extinguishment of debt offset by the increase in enhancedview deferred revenue as a result of payments received from nga during the year  and increased non cash stock compensation expense primarily due to the departure of the prior ceo 

table of contents cash used in investing activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the construction of the worldview satellite and related infrastructure 
as disclosed in the contractual obligations table  we have million that is contractually due to third party vendors 
these contractual obligations are primarily related to the procurement and construction of our worldview satellite  including launch vehicle and related ground systems 
cash provided by financing activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the new credit facility entered into on october  offset by the early extinguishment and repayment of the senior secured notes 
senior secured credit facility on october   we entered into a million  seven year senior secured term loan facility and a million  five year senior secured revolving credit facility  the terms of which are set forth in a credit and guaranty agreement dated as of october  among the company  the guarantors party thereto  the lenders named therein and jp morgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and as collateral agent the credit agreement 
we have borrowed the full amount of the term loan facility to fund our cash tender offer tender offer to purchase all of our senior secured notes and add liquidity for general corporate purposes 
we received net cash proceeds from the term loan facility of approximately million following the payment of approximately million for the tender of the senior secured notes  million in underwriter and other related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the credit agreement  and net of the term loan issuance discount of million 
the company paid million in fees related to the tender offer 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  during the fourth quarter of as a result of the tender offer  of all senior secured notes were tendered and retired by the company on october  we will use the remaining cash proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions and share repurchases 
as of the date of this filing  the revolving credit facility remains undrawn 
the obligations of the company under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the guarantors  subject to certain exceptions 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are usual and customary for a senior secured credit agreement 
the negative covenants include  among other things  limitations on asset sales  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  dividends  investments and transactions with our affiliates 
the credit agreement also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either an adjusted libor rate or a base rate  in each case plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is for adjusted libor loans or for base rate loans 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility may change depending on our leverage ratio  up to a maximum of 
the term loan facility currently bears interest based upon the libor based rate 
we will also pay a commitment fee of between to basis points  payable quarterly  on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility based on our leverage ratio 
senior secured notes on april   we issued million principal amount of our senior secured notes 
net proceeds of million were used to repay our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes in full and pay fees and expenses associated with the transaction 
the senior secured notes were scheduled to mature on may  the senior secured notes were guaranteed by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries and secured by nearly all of our assets  including the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries  and the quickbird  worldview

contractual obligations are remaining amounts due on long term contracts primarily relating to the procurement and construction of our worldview satellite  including the launch vehicle  and operational commitments related to our ground systems 
our operating leases are primarily for office space in the united states 
we generally believe leasing office space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate  for our existing operating locations 
the company has million of uncertain tax positions and does not anticipate a material change within the next months 
guaranty and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with resellers and others 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret or other intellectual property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against claims relating to property damage  personal injury or acts or omissions by us  our employees  agents or representatives

there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the 
table of contents difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours 
adjusted ebitda is a key measure used in internal operating reports by management and the board of directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and is also used by analysts  investment banks and lenders for the same purpose 
adjusted ebitda has also been a key driver of the company wide bonus incentive plan 
adjusted ebitda is a measure of our current period operating performance  excluding charges for capital  depreciation related to prior period capital expenditures and items which are generally non core in nature  and including enhancedview deferred revenue and enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga and excluding the amortization of pre foc payments related to our nextview contract 
enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga represent an irrevocable right to be paid in cash by nga 
we believe that the elimination of material non cash  non operating items enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations 
in addition  we believe that elimination of these items in combination with the addition of the nonrefundable enhancedview deferred revenue and enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga as well as the elimination of amortization of pre foc payments related to nextview  facilitate comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry 
we believe this adjusted ebitda measure is particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours  in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures 
the cost to construct and launch a satellite and build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another  depending on the satellite s size  type and capabilities 
for example  our quickbird satellite  which we are currently depreciating  cost significantly less than our worldview and worldview satellites 
current depreciation expense is not indicative of the revenue generating potential of the satellite 
adjusted ebitda excludes interest income  interest expense  income taxes and loss on early extinguishment of debt because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash stock compensation expense  because these items are non cash expenses and loss on derivative instrument and disposal of assets because these are not related to our primary operations 
we use adjusted ebitda in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance and we do not place undue reliance on this measure as our only measure of operating performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the licensing of earth imagery products and services for end users and resellers 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and the collection of funds is reasonably assured 
our revenue is generated from i sales of or royalties arising from licenses of imagery  and ii subscription services and other service arrangements 
sales of licenses 
revenue from sales of imagery licenses is recognized when the images are physically delivered to the customer or  in the case of electronic delivery  when the customer is able to directly download the image from our system 
in certain customer arrangements  we must satisfy certain acceptance provisions 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized upon acceptance by these customers 
revenue is recognized net of contractually agreed discounts 
royalties 
revenue from royalties is based on agreements or licenses with third parties that allow the third party to incorporate our product into their value added product for commercial distribution 
revenue from these 
table of contents royalty arrangements is recorded in the period earned or on a systematic basis over the term of the license agreement 
for those royalties that are due to third parties based on our revenue sharing arrangements  we report royalty revenue on a net basis 
subscriptions 
we sell online subscriptions to our products 
these arrangements allow customers access to our products via the internet for a set period of time and a fixed fee 
the subscription revenue is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
in addition  we have other arrangements in which customers pay for their subscription to one of our web based products by paying for a predetermined amount of access for example  each time users click on an image of their home 
in the case of prepayment  each time a product is accessed  a portion of the customer s prepayment is earned 
these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue when received and the revenue is recognized based on the number of times the product is accessed 
revenue is recognized net of contractually agreed discounts 
service level agreements sla 
we recognize service level agreement revenue net of any allowances resulting from failure to meet certain stated monthly performance metrics 
net revenue is either recognized ratably over time for a defined and fixed level of service  or based on proportional performance when the level of service changes based on certain criteria stated in the agreement 
multiple deliverable arrangements 
we enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our product and service offerings based on the needs of our customers 
these arrangements may include products delivered at the onset of the agreement  as well as products or services that are delivered over multiple reporting periods 
in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we concurrently adopted asu and asu prospectively on january  asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
asu excludes software that is contained in a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
we have generally been unable to establish vsoe for any of our products due to our infrequently selling each deliverable separately or only having a limited sales history  such as in the case of new or emerging products 
as of december   we have been unable to establish tpe for any of our offerings due to the unique nature of our products and services and the limited number of competitors 
as we are unable to establish price on the basis of vsoe or tpe  we use besp to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors  including but not limited to market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  product technology lifecycles  pricing practices and our go to market strategy 
the adoption of asu and asu was not material to our financial results for the year ended december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified multiple element arrangements transacted in any given period 
while multiple deliverable arrangements occur throughout our business  the enhancedview contract with nga and the dap make up the majority of our multiple deliverable arrangement activity 
enhancedview and four of our dap agreements were entered into prior to the january  adoption of asu and asu and none have been subsequently materially modified 
as we adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis  the agreements will continue to be accounted for under the pre adoption guidance unless they are materially modified 
the following is a description of the accounting for these arrangements 

table of contents enhancedview 
the enhancedview contract contains multiple deliverables  including an sla  infrastructure enhancements  and other services 
we determined that these deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting due to a lack of standalone value for the delivered elements and a lack of objective reliable evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
we recognize revenue on a single unit of accounting using a proportional performance method based on the estimated capacity of our constellation made available to nga compared to the total estimated capacity to be provided over the life of the contract 
direct access program 
revenue under the direct access program includes construction of the direct access facility and an arrangement to allow the customer access to the satellite to task and download imagery 
in these arrangements the facility is delivered upon completion and customer acceptance  and the maintenance and access services occur over several subsequent reporting periods 
these arrangements have generally been treated as a single unit of accounting due to a lack of standalone value for the delivered elements and a lack of objective reliable evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered items 
accordingly  all funds received are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
as the direct access facilities are brought into service  the deferred revenue is amortized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period  which is consistent with the estimated remaining useful life of the satellite being used 
asset valuation and estimated useful lives of satellites asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill  capitalized contract and related satellite costs and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate or if our other assumptions are not met  our actual bad debt expense could exceed our estimate 
we capitalize interest  an allocated portion of launch insurance premiums  contract costs and internal direct labor costs incurred 
once a satellite is operational  we depreciate the asset over the expected operational life 
changes in the estimates of the operational life of the asset are reflected in subsequent periods as adjustments to future depreciation expenses 
following each launch  and at least annually thereafter  we review the expected operational life of our satellites 
we determine a satellite s expected operational life using a complex calculation involving the probabilities of failure of the satellite s components from design or manufacturing defects  environmental stresses or other causes 
the expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of construction  the supply of fuel  the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels and other components  levels of solar radiation  the durability of various satellite components and the orbits in which the satellites are placed 
income taxes the current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax laws is recognized as an adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period is equal to the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence  it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
as of december   there are no income tax positions for which we currently believe that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next twelve months 
tax years still open for examination by federal and major state agencies as of december  are through 
table of contents federal and state agencies may disallow research tax carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and other carryforwards previously claimed 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future federal and state taxable income 
if not used  the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times during the period from to the internal revenue code places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss carryforwards  which can be utilized  if certain changes in the company s ownership occur 
included in the company s federal net operating loss carryforward is million that is subject to a million annual irc limitation  which is expected to be fully utilized in future periods 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the cost of our satellites and related ground systems include capitalized interest costs incurred during their construction and development period  as well as  capitalized costs for internal direct labor costs incurred in the construction and development 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
while under construction  the costs of our satellites are capitalized during the construction phase  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the satellite 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss were to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop software for internal use 
we expense the costs of developing computer software until the software has reached the application development stage and capitalize all costs incurred from that time until the software is ready for its intended use  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
determination of when the software has reached the application development stage is based upon completion of conceptual designs  evaluation of alternative designs and performance requirements 
costs of major enhancements to internal use software are capitalized while routine maintenance of existing software is charged to expense as incurred 
the determination of when the software is in the application development stage and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain factors  including  but not limited to  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology 
internal use capitalized software costs are amortized over their expected useful life  which is generally three to five years 
software costs that are directly related to a satellite are capitalized with the satellite and amortized over the satellite s useful life 
amortization expense related to capitalized software costs  exclusive of software costs amortized as part of the cost of our satellites  was million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  such as three to seven years for computer equipment and five to eleven years for most other assets  including the satellite and ground stations 
leasehold improvements and assets used pursuant to capital lease obligations are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their useful lives or lease terms  such amortization is included in depreciation expense 
upon sale or retirement  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
accounting for stock options we apply the fair value recognition provisions of stock based compensation expense and measure stock compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant for purposes of calculating the fair value of our stock option grants  we utilize the most recent publicly traded stock price on the grant date 

table of contents we established a peer group of comparable publicly traded companies 
annually  we review the companies that comprise the peer group and that from time to time have changed the composition of the peer group  based on changes to our business or the business of the comparable companies and other factors outside of our control  such as mergers and consolidations 
at each stock option grant date  we utilized the peer group data to calculate our expected volatility 
expected volatility was based on comparable companies four year history for options granted prior to  and five year history for options granted after expected term and forfeiture rate were based on existing employee exercise patterns and our historical pre vested forfeiture experience 
the risk free rate was based on an average of the yields of the treasury note with a maturity corresponding to the expected term of the option assumed at the grant date 
changes to the underlying assumptions  including increased forfeiture rates  may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
this authoritative guidance permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and earlier adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the implementation of this authoritative guidance to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
this guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted  and should be applied retrospectively 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance will only change the presentation of comprehensive income and will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this authoritative guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
this authoritative guidance also expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
the new guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this authoritative guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this authoritative guidance becomes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates under our senior secured facility 
the facility provides for a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
at the closing of the facility  we borrowed the full amount of the term loan facility 
as of december   we had not drawn any amounts under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either an adjusted libor rate or a base rate  in each case  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility is for adjusted libor loans or for base rate loans 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility may change depending upon our leverage ratio  up to a maximum of 
our term loan facility currently bears interest based upon the libor based rate 
based upon the amounts outstanding under the term loan facility as of december  and assuming that the facility is outstanding for a full calendar year  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in our annual interest expense under the facility of approximately million 
we may decide in the future to engage in various hedging transactions in order to hedge the interest rate risk under our senior secured credit facility but have not done so at this time 
we are exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
we do not currently have any material foreign currency exposure 
our revenue contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and the majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars
