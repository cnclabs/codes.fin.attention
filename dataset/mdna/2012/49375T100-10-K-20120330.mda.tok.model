our telephone number is products our infant and juvenile product line currently consists of approximately  products that principally focus on children of the age group newborn to three years 
we have also recently begun to expand the age range of our addressable consumer market by developing and marketing certain products for children of ages three through seven  including toddler bedding and beds as well as food preparation and kitchen products 
kids line products  which are marketed primarily under the kids line  carter s and disney brands  and cocalo products  which are marketed primarily under the cocalo baby  cocalo couture  and cocalo naturals tm brands  each consist primarily of infant bedding and related nursery accessories and d cor such as blankets  rugs  mobiles  nightlights  hampers  lamps and wall art  as well as specified kitchen and nursery appliances  diaper bags and spa bath products 
lajobi products  which are marketed primarily under the babi italia  europa baby  bonavita  graco and serta brands  consist primarily of cribs  mattresses and other nursery furniture 
sassy products  which are marketed primarily under the sassy  carter s and garanimals brands  consist primarily of developmental toys and feeding  bath and baby care items with features that address the various stages of an infant s early years 

table of contents most of our infant and juvenile products have wholesale selling prices between and  with the exception of lajobi furniture products  which have wholesale selling prices of to product sales are highly diverse and no single item represented more than of our consolidated net sales in the company currently categorizes its sales in five product categories soft good basics  hard good basics  toys and entertainment  accessories and d cor  and other 
soft good basics includes bedding  blankets and mattresses 
hard good basics includes cribs and other nursery furniture  feeding  food preparation and kitchen products  baby gear and organizers 
toys and entertainment includes developmental toys  bath toys and mobiles 
accessories and d cor includes hampers  lamps  rugs and d cor 
other includes all other products that do not fit in the above four categories 
the following table sets forth the company s consolidated net sales by product category  as a percentage of total consolidated net sales  for the years ended december    and year ended december  soft good basics hard good basics toys and entertainment accessories and d cor other total design and production we maintain a continuing program of new product development 
we design most of our own products  although certain products are designed by independent designers or are licensed from other third parties 
items are added to the product line only if we believe that they can be sourced and marketed on a basis that meets our profitability standards 
generally  a new design is brought to market in less than one year after a decision is made to produce the product 
sales of our products are  in large part  dependent on our ability to anticipate  identify and react quickly to changing consumer preferences and to effectively utilize our sales and distribution systems to bring new products to market 
we occasionally engage in market research and test marketing to evaluate consumer reactions to our products 
research into consumer buying trends often suggests new products 
we assemble information from retail stores  our sales force  focus groups  industry experts  vendors and our product development personnel 
we continually analyze our products to determine whether they should be adapted into new or different products using elements of the initial design or whether they should be removed from the product line 
substantially all of our products are produced by independent manufacturers  generally in eastern asia  under the quality review of approximately individuals in the prc  thailand  hong kong and vietnam who monitor the production process with responsibility for the quality  safety and prompt delivery of our products  as well as certain compliance and product development issues 
we have established subsidiaries in the prc  hong kong and thailand to oversee our quality assurance activities in asia  and have retained the full time services of such individuals  either directly through such subsidiaries  or through third party outsource agencies 
see the company s quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  the september q for a discussion of our east asia quality control staff  a description of the previous retention of certain of these individuals through a company affiliated with the former president of lajobi and various members of his family  and the potential impact of such prior staffing and related payment practices 
our products are designed  manufactured  packaged and labeled to conform to all applicable safety requirements under us federal and other applicable laws and regulations  various industry developed voluntary standards and product specific standards 
during  we utilized numerous manufacturers in eastern asia for our operations  with facilities primarily in the prc and other eastern asia countries 
during  approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our operations was attributable to manufacturing in the prc 
members of our eastern asia and us product development staff make frequent visits to such manufacturers 
the prc currently enjoys permanent normal trade relations pntr status under us tariff laws  which generally provides a favorable category of us import duties 
the loss of such pntr status would result in a substantial increase in the import duty for products manufactured for us in the prc and imported into the united states and would result in an increase in our sourcing costs 
in addition  certain categories of wooden bedroom furniture previously imported from the prc by our lajobi subsidiary were also subject to anti dumping duties 
for a discussion of charges taken for anticipated anti dumping duties and related interest and other actions resulting from lajobi s prior import practices  including a restatement of specified financial statements and a liability in the approximate amount of million recorded in connection therewith  see item  legal proceedings  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have discontinued the practices that resulted in these anticipated anti dumping duties and have established alternate vendor arrangements for the relevant product in countries that are not subject to such anti dumping duties 
also see risk factors any failure to fully comply with the laws of various asian jurisdictions could cause potential liability and have other adverse effects 
in  the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of the purchases for our operations accounted for approximately of such purchases  and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate 
we believe  however  that there are alternate manufacturers for our products and sources of raw materials 
see item a  risk factors we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products  as well as note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations 

table of contents marketing and sales our products are marketed through our own direct sales force of full time employees  as well as through independent manufacturers representatives and distributors to retail customers in the united states and certain foreign countries including  but not limited to  mass merchandisers  baby superstores  specialty stores  department stores and boutiques 
during  we maintained a direct sales force and distribution network for our operations in the united states  the united kingdom and australia 
we also maintain relationships with several independent representatives to service select domestic and foreign retail customers  as well as international distributors to service certain retail customers in several foreign countries 
our sales attributable to foreign based operations were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our consolidated foreign sales from operations  including export sales from the united states  aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to  among other things  revenues from external customers and total assets for each of the years ending december   and  respectively  as well as specified geographic information 
during  we sold infant and juvenile products to approximately  customers worldwide 
toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately  wal mart stores  inc walmart accounted for approximately  and target corporation target accounted for approximately of our consolidated gross sales during the loss of any of these customers  the loss of certain other large customers  or a significant reduction in the volume of business conducted with any such customers  could have a material adverse affect on us 
see item a  risk factors our business is dependent on several large customers and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we reinforce the marketing efforts of our sales force through an active promotional program  including showrooms at our principal facilities  participation in trade shows  and trade and consumer advertising  as well as a growing set of internet based promotional activities 
we also seek to further capture synergies between our businesses by cross marketing products and building upon the strong customer relationships developed by each of our subsidiaries  as well as by consolidating certain operational activities 
customer service is an essential component of our marketing strategy 
we maintain customer service departments that respond to customer inquiries  investigate and resolve issues and generally assist customers and or consumers 
our general terms of sale are competitive with others in our industry 
sales are typically made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
however  commencing in late  we occasionally elect to participate in an auction program initiated by one of our largest customers  which permits us to offer an additional discount on all or a portion of the outstanding accounts receivable from such customer in return for prompt  accelerated payment of all or the relevant portion of such receivable 
the amount of the additional discount is subject to acceptance  is determined in part by the aging of the receivable and is within the range of customary discounts for early payment 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
notwithstanding the foregoing  in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions or  on occasion  accept returns 
distribution many of our customers  particularly mass merchandisers  pick up their goods at our regional distribution centers  which are located in south gate  california  cranbury  new jersey  and kentwood  michigan 
we also use common carriers to arrange shipments to customers who request such arrangements  including smaller retailers and specialty stores 
cocalo distributes its products through a third party logistics provider unaffiliated since january  
lajobi also utilizes the services of independent third party logistics providers in california for a portion of its distribution requirements  and our subsidiaries in australia and the uk utilize the services of independent third party logistics providers in their respective jurisdictions 
seasonality we typically do not experience significant seasonal variations in demand for our products  although we typically do experience slightly higher sales during the second half of the fiscal year 
in  approximately of our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
sales to our retail customers may be higher in periods when retailers take initial shipments of new products  as these orders typically incorporate enough products to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year and whether there are any mid year product introductions 

table of contents competition the infant and juvenile products industry is highly competitive and is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products and includes numerous domestic and foreign competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have financial and other resources greater than ours 
we compete with a number of different competitors  depending on the product category  and compete against no single company across all of our product categories 
our competition includes large infant and juvenile product companies and specialty infant and juvenile product manufacturers 
we compete principally on the basis of proprietary product design  brand name recognition  product quality  innovation  and relationships with major retailers  customer service and price value relationship 
in addition  certain of our potential customers  in particular mass merchandisers  have the financial and other resources necessary to buy products similar to those that we sell directly from manufacturers in eastern asia and elsewhere  thereby potentially reducing the size of our potential market 
see item a  risk factors competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
copyrights  trademarks  patents and licenses we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights  patents  licenses and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property 
we believe our intellectual property has significant value  though we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on such intellectual property due to the availability of substitutes and our ability to create new designs  and the variety of products that we sell 
intellectual property protections are limited or even unavailable in some foreign countries and preventing unauthorized use of our intellectual property can be difficult even in countries with substantial legal protection 
in addition  the portion of our business that relies on the use of intellectual property is subject to the risk of challenges by third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights 
see item  risk factors trademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs 
we enter into license agreements relating to trademarks  copyrights  patents  designs and products which enable us to market items compatible with our product line 
we believe that our license agreements are important assets for our business 
we currently maintain license agreements with  among others  the william carter company carter s  disney enterprises  inc  graco children s products  inc  serta  inc  and garanimals 
our license agreements are typically for terms of two to five years with extensions possible if agreed to by both parties 
royalties are paid on licensed products and  in many cases  advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements 
although we do not believe our business is dependent on any single license  the graco license which expires on december   subject to renewals and the carter s license which expires on december   subject to renewals are each material to and accounted for a material portion of the net revenues of lajobi and kids line  respectively  as well as a significant percentage of the net revenues of the company  in each case for each of the last three years 
in addition  the serta license which expires on december   subject to renewals is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of lajobi  the disney license which expires on december   subject to renewals is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of kids line  and the garanimals license which expires on december  is material to and accounted for a significant percentage of the net revenues of sassy  in each case other than garanimals which commenced in for the last three years ended december  while historically we have been able to renew the license agreements that we wish to continue on terms acceptable to us  the loss of any of the foregoing and or other significant license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  at least until such time  if ever  that appropriate replacements can be secured and related products marketed on commercially acceptable terms 
see item a  risk factors competition for licenses could increase our licensing costs or limit our ability to market products and the loss of any significant license could adversely affect our business 
in connection with the sale of kid s former gift business to the russ companies  inc trc  a limited liability company wholly owned by kid the licensor executed a license agreement the license agreement with trc permitting trc to use specified intellectual property  consisting generally of the russ and applause trademarks and trade names the retained ip 
pursuant to the license agreement  trc was required to pay the licensor an annual royalty of  kid received  in respect of the royalty payment due march  under the license agreement  which was recorded as other income in the first quarter of  but did not receive any other royalty payments due thereunder 
on april   trc and trc s domestic subsidiaries collectively  the debtors  filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey the bankruptcy court 
on june   the bankruptcy court entered an order which  among other things  approved a settlement with the secured creditors of the debtors  including kid the settlement 
among other things  the settlement allows us to retain ownership of the retained ip 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the settlement 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed approximately persons 
in addition  we currently utilize the full time services of approximately individuals in the prc  thailand  hong kong and vietnam  a portion of which are employed directly by the company s asian subsidiaries and the remainder of which are employed through third party outsource agencies 
see  business design and production  risk factors any failure to fully comply with the laws of various asian jurisdictions could cause potential liability and have other adverse effects and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
most of our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement  although approximately sassy employees  representing approximately of our total employees  were represented by a collective bargaining agreement as of december  government regulation certain of our products are subject to the provisions of  among other laws  the federal hazardous substances act  the federal consumer product safety act and the federal consumer product safety improvement act 
those laws empower the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to protect consumers from certain hazardous articles by regulating their use or excluding them from the market and requiring the recall of products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
the cpsc s determination is subject to judicial review 
similar laws exist in some states and cities in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold 
we maintain a quality control program in order to comply with such laws  and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all the foregoing laws 
notwithstanding the foregoing  no assurance can be made that all products are or will be free from hazards or defects  or that rapidly changing safety standards will not render unsaleable products that complied with previously applicable safety standards 
see item a  risk factors product liability  product recalls and other claims relating to the use of our products could increase our costs

risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below constitute the material risks pertaining to our business 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
in such cases  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
our net sales and profitability depend on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market products that appeal to consumers 
the introduction of new products is critical in our industry and to our growth strategy 
a significant percentage of our product line is replaced each year with new products 
our business depends on our ability to continue to conceive  design and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of our product offerings 
rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends make it difficult to predict how long consumer demand for our existing products will continue or which new products will be successful 
our current products may not continue to be popular or new products that we introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
a decline in consumer demand for our products  our failure to develop new products on a timely basis in anticipation of changing consumer preferences or the failure of our new products to achieve and sustain consumer acceptance could reduce our net sales and profitability 
in addition  changes in customer preferences leave us vulnerable to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
thus  our ability to manage our inventories properly is an important factor in our operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales and brand loyalty 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to the excessive discounts and markdowns that might be necessary to reduce inventory levels 
our inability to effectively manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents gross margin could be adversely affected by several factors 
gross margin was adversely affected in and may be adversely affected in the future by increases in vendor costs including as a result of increases in the cost of raw materials  labor or other costs or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume or freight rates  price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
for example  increased costs in the prc  primarily for labor  raw materials  and the impact of certain tax laws  as well as the appreciation of the chinese yuan against the us dollar  have at times  including during  negatively impacted our gross margins 
we currently expect prc labor and other costs to continue to rise in the near term 
in addition  pressure from major retailers  primarily as a result of continued challenging economic conditions  to offer additional mark downs and other credits or price concessions to clear existing inventory and secure new product placements  or to accept additional returns  have and may continue to negatively impact our margins 
economic conditions  such as rising fuel prices and currency exchange fluctuations  may also adversely impact our margins 
our kids line and cocalo businesses use significant quantities of cotton  either in the form of cotton fabric or cotton polyester fabric 
cotton is subject to ongoing price fluctuations because it is an agricultural product impacted by changing weather patterns  disease and other factors  such as supply and demand considerations  both domestically and internationally 
in addition  increased oil prices affect key components of the raw material prices in many of our products 
significant increases in the prices of cotton or oil have and could adversely affect our gross margins and our operations 
in addition  charges pertaining to anti dumping duties that we anticipate will be owed by our lajobi subsidiary to us customs  and charges pertaining to customs duties we anticipate will be owed by our kids line and cocalo subsidiaries to us customs have affected gross margins and net income for specified periods see the explanatory note above and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the restatement of prior financial statements herein  as described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  had a positive impact on previously reported results of operations for and  and a negative impact on previously reported results of operation for prior periods 
as the customs matters have not been concluded  however  it is possible that the actual amount of duty owed for the relevant periods could be higher than currently accrued amounts  and in any event  additional interest will continue to accrue until payment is made 
in addition  we may be assessed by us customs a penalty of up to of any customs duty owed  as well as possibly being subject to additional fines  penalties or other measures from us customs or other governmental authorities 
any amounts owed in excess of the accruals recorded will adversely affect our gross margin and net income for the period s in which such amounts are recorded and could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the lajobi anti dumping duty matters and the kids line cocalo customs duty matters 
we have discontinued the practices that resulted in the charge for anticipated anti dumping duties  and have established alternate vendor arrangements for the relevant product in countries that are not subject to such anti dumping duties 
we believe that our ability to procure the affected categories of furniture has not been materially adversely affected 
our business is dependent on several large customers 
the continued success of our infant and juvenile businesses depends on our ability to continue to sell our products to several large mass market retailers 
in particular  toys r us  inc and babies r us  inc considered together  wal mart and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated gross sales for the calendar year 
while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  we typically do not have long term contracts with our customers and our agreements with these customers do not require them to purchase any specific number or amount of our products 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  returns  cooperative advertising or special promotions or allowances  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each customer 
no assurance can be given that these or other customers will continue to do business with us or that they will maintain their historical levels of business  and the loss of one or more of the foregoing customers or one or more of our other large customers could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  our success depends upon the continuing willingness of large retailers to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
our access to shelf space at retailers for our products may be reduced by store closings  consolidation among these retailers  competition from other products or stricter requirements for infant and juvenile products by retailers that we may not be able to meet 
an adverse change in our relationship with  or the financial viability of  one or more of our large customers could reduce our net sales and profitability 

table of contents competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
certain of our competitors have greater brand recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  we may face competition from new participants in our markets because the infant and juvenile product industry has limited barriers to entry 
many of our principal customers are large mass merchandisers 
the rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers  together with changes in consumer shopping patterns  have contributed to the formation of dominant multi category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers 
current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers  demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times 
other trends are for retailers to import products directly from factory sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with our products 
the combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which our principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use  resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for consumer meaningful brands  the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products  continuing improvements in customer service  and the maintenance of strong relationships with large  high volume purchasers 
we also face the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of our major retailer customers  such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation 
the resulting risks include possible loss of sales  reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases 
we also experience price competition for our products  competition for shelf space at retailers and competition for licenses  all of which may increase in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully in the future  our net sales and profitability will likely decline 
to compete successfully  we must develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands 
our ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on our ability to develop and maintain consumer meaningful brands so that our retailer customers will need our products to meet consumer demand 
the development and maintenance of such brands requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives  although any such investment may not deliver the anticipated results 
the state of the economy may impact our business 
our business and results of operations are affected by international  national and regional economic conditions 
the united states and many other international economies experienced a major recession in recent periods  with continuing effects for our industry 
the end users of our products are individual consumers 
a hesitant recovery in the u 
s economy  high unemployment  volatile capital markets  depressed housing prices and tight consumer lending practices have resulted in considerable negative pressure on consumer spending and consumer confidence  which we believe has resulted in lower birth rates and could result in reduced demand for our products 
in the event that current economic conditions worsen  current and potential consumers of our products may be inclined to delay their purchases  and further tightening of credit markets may restrict our customers both direct and indirect ability and willingness to make purchases 
in addition  continuing adverse global economic conditions in our markets could result in increased price competition for our products  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased risk in the collectability of accounts receivable from our direct customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  delays in signing or failing to sign direct customer contracts or signing customer agreements at reduced purchase levels  and limitations in the capital resources available to us and others with whom we conduct business 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents we are currently party to litigation that could be costly to defend and distracting to management  and if decided against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the company received a letter on july  from counsel to lawrence bivona demanding payment of the lajobi earnout consideration to mr 
bivona in the amount of million  and a letter from counsel to mr 
bivona alleging that mr 
bivona s termination by lajobi for cause violated his employment agreement and demanding payment to mr 
bivona of amounts purportedly due under such employment agreement 
on december   mr 
bivona initiated an arbitration proceeding with respect to these and related issues seeking damages in excess of million 
on february   the company and lajobi filed an answer thereto  in which they denied any liability  asserted counterclaims against mr 
bivona  and asserted a third party complaint against mr 
bivona s brother and the lajobi seller 
because the restatement of the prior financial statements results in the technical satisfaction of the formulaic provisions for the payment of a portion of the lajobi earnout under the agreement governing the purchase of the lajobi assets  applicable accounting standards require that the company record a liability in the amount of the formulaic calculation  without taking into consideration the company s affirmative defenses  counterclaims and third party claims 
accordingly  in connection with the restatement of the prior financial statements herein  the company recorded a liability in the approximate amount of million for the year ended december  million in respect of the lajobi earnout and million in respect of a related finder s fee  with an offset in equal amount to goodwill  all of which goodwill was impaired as of december  while we intend to vigorously defend against all of mr 
bivona s claims  and believe that we will prevail  based on  among other things  our affirmative defenses  counterclaims and third party claims in which case we will be able to reverse such liability  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
an adverse decision in the arbitration that requires any significant payment by us to mr 
bivona or the lajobi seller could result in a default under our credit agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants below 
also see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the august refinancing of the company s senior secured financing facility  including a discussion of conditions precedent to any lajobi earnout payment requirements and the impact of any such payment on our required financial covenants 
in march  a purported class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of persons who allegedly purchased our common stock between march  and august  the complaint  among other things  alleged one claim for relief pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and rule b promulgated thereunder  and a second claim pursuant to section a of the exchange act  claiming generally that we and or other specified defendants issued materially false and misleading statements during the relevant time period regarding compliance with customs laws  our financial reports and internal controls 
on march   the complaint was dismissed without prejudice in a decision that cited the complaint s failure to meet applicable pleading standards 
the plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint  within sixty days  in a manner consistent with the court s decision 
to date  no amended complaint has been filed 
in addition  in may  a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed by the city of roseville employees retirement system in the united states district court of the district of new jersey  alleging that specified defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allegedly failing to oversee and disclose alleged misconduct at kid s lajobi subsidiary related to lajobi s compliance with us customs laws 
in addition to asserting the breach of fiduciary duty claim  the complaint also asserted claims of gross mismanagement  abuse of control and commission of corporate waste and for unjust enrichment 
on october   the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss without prejudice in a decision that cited the complaint s failure to meet applicable pleading standards required to bring a shareholder derivative claim 
the plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint in a manner consistent with the court s decision 
as of the date of this report  such plaintiff has initiated a books and records inspection  to which the company is responding 
additional litigation may be initiated against us based on the alleged items at issue in the complaints described above  or based on the restatement of specified financial statements as described in the explanatory note above 
in addition  the plaintiffs may amend the putative class action and or derivative complaints in a manner consistent with the decisions of the applicable court 
we cannot predict the final outcome of such lawsuits or the likelihood that further proceedings will be instituted against us 
although we believe that the claims in the putative class action and putative shareholder derivative action are covered by insurance and that the applicable deductible has been satisfied  there can be no assurance that this is the case 
accordingly  the cost of defending against such lawsuits  other lawsuits pending against the company  or any future lawsuits or proceedings may be high and  in any event  these legal proceedings may result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from our business 
in the event that there is an adverse ruling in any legal proceeding  we may be required to make payments to third parties that could harm our business  financial results or reputation 
see item  legal proceedings for more detail with respect to these and other material legal proceedings to which the company or its subsidiaries are parties 
our debt covenants may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions  incur debt  make investments  sell assets  merge or complete other significant transactions 
our current credit agreement includes provisions that place limitations on a number of our activities  including our ability to incur additional debt  create liens on our assets or make guarantees  make certain investments or loans  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  dispose of or sell assets  or enter into acquisitions  mergers or similar transactions 
these covenants could restrict our ability to pursue opportunities to expand our business operations 
we are required to make prepayments of our debt upon a sale of the assets or membership interests in the licensor or the real estate owned by sassy 

table of contents inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants 
our ability to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our current credit agreement is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our business model and our ability to generate cash from operations  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions 
see the state of the economy may impact our business above and the other factors discussed in this risk factors section 
if an event of default in such covenants occurs and is continuing  among other things  the lenders may accelerate the loans  declare the commitments thereunder to be terminated  seize collateral or take other actions of secured creditors 
if the loans are accelerated or commitments terminated  we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
such alternative measures may not be available or successful 
also  our bank covenants may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
even if we are able to restructure or refinance our indebtedness  the economic terms may not be favorable to us 
in addition  an event of default under our credit agreement could result in a cross default under certain license agreements that we maintain 
all of the foregoing could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the sections captioned liquidity and capital resources and debt financing  as well as note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
the loans under our credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at a specified base rate or eurodollar rate  plus applicable margins  which vary between and on eurodollar borrowings and 
and on base rate borrowings 
at december   the applicable margins were for eurodollar borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
increases in the interest rate under our credit agreement will increase our interest expense  which could harm our profitability and cash flow 
deviations from expected results of operations and or expected cash requirements could result in a default under our credit agreement and or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our bank facility 
our operating activities generally provide sufficient cash to fund our working capital requirements and  together with borrowings under our bank facility  are expected to be sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months including expected customs duty assessments and related interest  based on current assumptions regarding the timing of such expenditures and anticipated cash flows 
based on our current expectations  we anticipate that availability under our bank facility  which is based on  among other things  a quarterly maximum consolidated leverage ratio  which is the ratio of the company s indebtedness to covenant ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for the most recently completed four quarters  will be substantially lower during the first two fiscal quarters of than it has been historically  or that we anticipate it will be in the second half of accordingly  any significant deviation in actual results from our expected results of operations  any significant deviation in the timing of material expenditures from current estimates  or any significant earnout payments  significant business or product acquisitions  or other significant unanticipated expenses including customs duty assessments and related interest in excess of current accruals  and or any related penalties could result in a default under our credit agreement  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and or may result in the need for additional debt or equity financing 
any significant payment by us in respect of the lajobi earnout consideration could result in a default under our credit agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants and we are currently party to litigation that could be costly to defend and distracting to management  and if decided against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business above 
see also debt financing new credit agreement in item below for conditions precedent contained in our credit agreement with respect to the payment of any earnout consideration  as well as the impact of any such payment on our required financial covenants 
more generally  if actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differ from judgments  assumptions and estimates made or used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amount of recoverability of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities including accruals for income taxes and liabilities and or other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents further potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if sufficient internal funds are not available from our operations  we may be required to further rely on the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as were experienced during and much of  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facility 
our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to such facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives  or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  and reducing or eliminating discretionary uses of cash 
the restatement of our specified historical financial statements may affect shareholder confidence  may consume a significant amount of our time and resources and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
as is described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and the explanatory note above  the company has restated specified financial statements in this k to reflect the recording of anticipated anti dumping duty payment requirements of the company s lajobi subsidiary and anticipated customs duty payment requirements of the company s kids line and cocalo subsidiaries and related interest in each case in the respective periods to which such liabilities relate 
we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken since we completed the restatement process will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future 
the restatement may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures  may raise reputational issues for our business  and may result in a decline in share price and shareholder lawsuits related to the restatement 
the restatement process was also highly time and resource intensive and involved substantial attention from management and significant legal and accounting costs 
although we have now completed the restatement other than with respect to quarterly reports during  we cannot guarantee that we will not receive inquiries from the sec or the new york stock exchange the nyse regarding our restated financial statements or matters relating thereto 
any future inquiries from the sec or the nyse as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will  regardless of the outcome  likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself 
we have received a letter regarding an informal investigation by the sec  as well as a request for information by the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey  and such investigation and request may require a significant amount of management resources and result in adverse consequences to the company 
on june   we received a letter from the new york regional office of the sec informing us that the sec was conducting an informal investigation  and requesting that we provide certain documents on a voluntary basis 
we believe we have fully cooperated and will continue to fully cooperate with the sec 
we are currently unable to predict whether a formal investigation will be initiated or what consequences any further investigation may have on us 
furthermore  we are unable to predict the likelihood of or potential outcomes from regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to the matters under investigation 
the resolution of these matters could be time consuming and expensive  further distract management from other business concerns and harm our business 
we cannot provide assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity  fines or penalties  as well as other sanctions or other contingent liabilities or adverse customer or market reactions in connection with the resolution of this matter  which could harm our business and financial condition 
in addition  on august   the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao contacted company counsel  requesting information relating to lajobi previously provided by the company to us customs and the sec  as well as additional documents 
we have and continue to cooperate with the usao on a voluntary basis 
we are currently unable to predict the duration  the resources required or outcome of the usao investigation or the impact such investigation may have on the company 

table of contents product liability  product recalls and other claims relating to the use of our products could increase our costs 
we face product liability risks relating to the use of our products 
we also must comply with a variety of product safety and product testing regulations 
in particular  our products are subject to  among other statutes and regulations  the consumer product safety act  the federal hazardous substances act  or the fhsa  and the consumer product safety improvement act  or the cpsia  which empower the consumer product safety commission  or the cpsc  to take action against hazards presented by consumer products  including adjudication and promulgation of regulations and uniform safety standards 
with expanded authority under the cpsia  the cpsc has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to substantially all of our products 
these new regulations have and are expected to further significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of infant and juvenile products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada  australia and europe  as well as certain other countries 
while we take the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future  or that rapidly changing safety standards will not render unsaleable products that complied with previously applicable safety standards 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  or if we face product liability claims  we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage  we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements  and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  concerns about potential liability or potential future changes in product safety regulations may lead us to recall voluntarily or otherwise discontinue selling selected products which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
recalls  post manufacture repairs of our products  or product liability claims could also harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future or take other actions that may adversely impact infant and juvenile products  including the categories of products that we produce and sell 
in addition  one or more of our customers might require changes or impose their own standards for our products  such as the non use of certain materials or a refusal to sell certain products 
complying with existing or any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business 
similarly  increased penalties for non compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations 
furthermore  substantially all of our licenses give the licensor the right to terminate the license agreement if any products marketed under the license are subject to a product liability claim  recall or similar violations of product safety regulations or if we breach covenants relating to the safety of the products or their compliance with product safety regulations 
a termination of a license could adversely affect our net sales 
even if a product liability claim is without merit  the claim could harm our reputation and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
if we lose key personnel we may not be able to achieve our objectives 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of various members of senior management  as well as senior executives of several of our subsidiaries 
if for any reason  these or other key members of management do not continue to be active in management  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain senior executives or other personnel necessary for the continued success of our business 
if additional intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
we test goodwill and our other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
we conduct testing for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded non cash impairment charges of approximately i million to goodwill  constituting all of the goodwill we were required to record as of december  in connection with the liability we were required to record with respect to potential lajobi earnout consideration and a related finder s fee as a result of the restatement of the prior financial statements  and the impact of such restatement on the formulaic provisions for the payment of a portion of the lajobi earnout under the agreement governing the purchase of the lajobi assets  ii million for the impairment of the lajobi trade names  and iii million for the impairment of our kids line customer relationships 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis  and we may incur additional impairment charges  which could be substantial and could adversely affect our financial results 
impairment assessments inherently involve judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to prices  costs  holding periods or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
factors that might reduce the fair value of an intangible asset below its carrying value include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 

table of contents we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our major retail customers 
certain of our retail customers purchase large quantities of our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our largest customers 
our profitability may be harmed if one or more of our largest customers were unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due or demand credits or other concessions for products they are unable to sell or for other reasons 
competition for licenses could increase our licensing costs or limit our ability to market products 
we market a significant portion of our products through licenses with other parties 
sales of licensed products represented of our net sales in fiscal year these licenses are generally limited in scope and duration and generally authorize the sale of specific licensed products on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis 
our license agreements often require us to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments that may exceed the amount we are able to generate from actual sales of the licensed products 
any termination of or failure to renew our significant licenses  or inability to develop and enter into new licenses  could limit our ability to market our licensed products or develop new products  and could materially reduce our net sales and profitability 
competition for licenses could require us to pay licensors higher royalties and higher minimum guaranteed payments in order to obtain or retain attractive licenses  which could increase our expenses 
in addition  licenses granted to other parties  whether or not exclusive  could limit our ability to market products  including products we currently market  which could cause our net sales and profitability to decline 
we rely on foreign suppliers  primarily in the prc  to manufacture most of our products  which subjects us to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in eastern asia  principally in the prc 
approximately of our dollar volume of purchases for our operations in were attributable to manufacturers in the prc 
the supplier accounting for the greatest dollar volume of purchases for our operations accounted for approximately and the five largest suppliers accounted for approximately in the aggregate during while we believe that there are many other manufacturing sources available for our product lines  difficulties encountered by one or several of our larger suppliers such as a fire  accident  natural disaster or an outbreak of illness eg  hn  sars  avian or other flu at one or more of their facilities  could halt or disrupt production at the affected facilities  delay the completion of orders  cause the cancellation of orders  delay the introduction of new products or cause us to miss a selling season applicable to some of our products 
in addition  our international operations subject us to certain other risks some of which are discussed in the following two risk factors and below  including economic and political instability  restrictive actions by foreign governments  changing international political relations  labor availability and cost  changes in laws  including tax or labor laws  or changes in regulations  treaties and policies  changes in shipping costs and availability of sufficient cargo capacity  changes in the availability and cost of raw materials  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights  changes in import duties or import or export restrictions including changes that could be imposed retroactively  delays in shipping of product and unloading of product through ports  as well as timely rail truck delivery to our warehouses and or a customer s warehouse  complications in complying with the laws and policies of the united states affecting the importation of goods  including duties  quotas and taxes see gross margin could be adversely affected by several factors above  
table of contents complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws  and the effects of terrorist activity  armed conflict and epidemics 
any of these risks could disrupt the supply of our products or increase our expenses 
the costs of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws may increase our expenses and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
in addition  the introduction or expansion of certain social programs in the prc or otherwise will likely increase the cost of doing business for certain of our manufacturers  which would likely increase our manufacturing costs 
with most of our manufacturers located in eastern asia  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately  we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders on a timely basis or in liquidating excess inventories 
another recent development affecting many companies importing goods from the prc is that it has become increasingly difficult to secure cargo capacity on a timely basis and at contracted prices 
this may signal a trend of higher ocean freight transportation prices in coming periods 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  labor in the prc has been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in north america 
the prc has experienced rapid social  political and economic change in recent years 
there is no assurance labor will continue to be available in the prc at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on product costs in the prc 
if our suppliers suffer labor shortages  this may result in future supply delays and disruptions and drive a substantial increase in labor costs 
any failure to fully comply with the laws of various asian jurisdictions could cause potential liability and have other adverse effects 
as previously disclosed  most recently in the september q  the asia staffing and related payment practices utilized by our lajobi subsidiary during may have violated a criminal law in thailand that requires certain disclosures in connection with wire transfers into that country  and likely violated a criminal law in hong kong  in the category of a petty violation  that requires registration by foreign companies doing business in that country 
in addition  lajobi may have violated certain foreign regulatory  administrative and civil laws in connection with its previous payment and employment practices in asia 
however  we currently do not believe that such matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case  and we have not accrued any amounts to date in connection therewith 
lajobi has since discontinued the payment and staffing practices in question  and we believe our asia operations are currently in compliance with applicable laws of the relevant asian countries 
however  there can be no assurance that applicable governmental authorities will not impose taxes or penalties or other measures with respect to such practices previously utilized by lajobi  or that our licensors  vendors and or retail partners will not take adverse action under applicable agreements with us or otherwise as a result of such potential compliance issues although we are unaware of any such actions to date 
our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions 
our operations in non us jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than united states law 
laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the united states  and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under united states law 
moreover  enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable  which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business 
as a result  our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non united states jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if united states law governed these operations 
we may have difficulty establishing adequate management  legal and financial controls in the prc and other asian countries 
the prc and certain other asian jurisdictions have historically had fewer or less developed management and financial reporting concepts and practices  as well as modern banking  computer  and other control systems 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and or retaining a sufficient number of qualified individuals in such jurisdictions 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in establishing management  legal  and financial controls  collecting financial data and preparing financial statements  books of account  and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet business standards such as those in the united states 

table of contents we may be unable to recover all or any portion of amounts owed to us by trc as a result of the filing by trc and its domestic subsidiaries of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under the united states bankruptcy code the code and the execution of a settlement agreement in connection therewith 
on april   trc  the acquirer of our former gift business  and trc s domestic subsidiaries  filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey 
as a subordinated lien holder with respect to a note payable to kid from trc in the original principal amount of million  kid may be able to recover a portion of amounts owed thereunder from trc s estate to the extent assets remain available for such payment under the code after payment in full of trc s senior lender 
we may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery of amounts owed to us as a secured creditor of trc  however  and will likely obtain only limited recovery  if any recovery at all 
in addition  licensor may be able to recover a portion of the royalties owed to it under the license agreement from trc s estate to the extent assets remain available under the code for payment to trc s general unsecured creditors  although we believe that it is unlikely that unsecured creditors of trc will realize any recovery 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the settlement agreement entered into by kid and the trc debtors 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses 
our net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  except for a small amount of net sales denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars and euros 
our purchases of finished goods from eastern asian manufacturers are denominated in us dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are denominated in chinese yuan or other eastern asian currencies 
as a result  any material increase in the value of the yuan or such other currencies relative to the us or australian dollars or the uk pound would increase the prices at which we purchase finished goods and therefore could adversely affect our profitability 
we are also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars or euros from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
trademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs 
we have from time to time received claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property relating to certain of our products  and we may face similar claims in the future 
the defense of intellectual property litigation can be both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management  even if the claim is without merit 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation 
in addition  these claims could materially harm our brand name  reputation and operations 
if our products are copied or knocked off  our sales of these products may be materially reduced and our profitability may be negatively affected 
occasionally in the infant and juvenile industry  successful products are knocked off or copied by competitors 
while we strive to protect our intellectual property  we cannot guarantee that knock offs will not occur or that they will not have a significant effect on our business 
the costs incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights could be significant  and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully protect our rights see preceding risk factor 
we may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we may pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our mission and enable us to leverage our competitive strengths 
the integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks including possible failure to maintain customer  licensor and other relationships after the closing of the transaction of the acquired company  the acquired business may experience losses which could adversely affect our profitability  unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses  difficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net sales  diversion of management s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations  and unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition  or 
table of contents possible failure to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer of licenses or other agreements of the acquired company 
additionally  we financed our acquisitions of kids line  lajobi and cocalo with senior debt financing 
this debt leverage  or additional leverage that may be incurred with any other future acquisitions  could adversely affect our profitability and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities 
disruptions in our current information technology systems or difficulties in implementing our new information technology system could harm our business 
system failure or malfunctioning in our information technology systems may result in disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions and could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we commenced the implementation in december of a new consolidated information technology system for the company  which we believe will provide greater efficiencies and greater reporting capabilities than those provided by the current separate systems in place across our individual infant and juvenile companies which includes functionality enhancements beyond the original project concept 
in connection with such implementation  we anticipate incurring aggregate costs of approximately million  of which million has been incurred as of december  we anticipate the balance of the costs to be incurred as follows million in and million in such costs have been financed to date with borrowings under our credit facility  and are intended to be so financed in the future 
our business may be subject to transitional difficulties as we replace the current systems 
these difficulties may include disruption of our operations  loss of data  and the diversion of our management and key employees attention away from other business matters 
the difficulties associated with any such implementation  and our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from the implementation  could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot assure our shareholders that our share repurchase program will enhance long term shareholder value  and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash availability 
on november   our board approved a share repurchase program 
under the program  we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock  in the open market or privately negotiated transactions  at times and prices considered appropriate by them depending upon prevailing market conditions and other corporate considerations  up to an aggregate purchase price of million 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows  price  corporate and regulatory requirements  and other market conditions  including limitations under our current credit agreement which  in addition to limits on revolver availability and a stricter consolidated leverage ratio for this purpose x less than the maximum then permitted  limits the aggregate amount that can be expended on share repurchases and dividends to million until the lajobi focused assessment has been concluded and all duty amounts required thereby have been paid 
the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our share price and increase its volatility 
the existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our share price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock 
additionally  repurchases under our share repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves and or availability under our current revolver  which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares 
any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price 
although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long term shareholder value  short term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program s effectiveness 
to date  no repurchases have been made under the new program 
our hosted software and web based services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
our hosted software and web based services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our software and web based services  we may be affected by such efforts in the future 
further  despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems  resulting in the potential misappropriation of our proprietary information or interruptions of our services 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could substantially disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services 

table of contents unauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by our customers or third parties  whether through breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party  employee theft or misuse  or otherwise  could harm our business 
the difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information has been a significant issue when engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our business relies on using the internet to transmit confidential information 
we believe that any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter companies from using the internet for these purposes 
our services present the potential for embezzlement  identity theft  or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties 
if there was a disclosure of confidential information  or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the confidential information we possess  our operations could be seriously disrupted  our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to claims pursuant to our agreements with our customers or other liabilities 
in addition  if this were to occur  we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds  documents  or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability or regulatory action 
a claim that is brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could harm our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources 
changes in our effective tax rate or changes in tax laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future effective tax rate and the amount of our provision for income taxes may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation expense  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations  or interpretations thereof  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  the resolution of issues arising from uncertain positions and tax audits with various tax authorities  and penalties and or interest expense that we may be required to recognize on liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world 
in preparing our financial statements  we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate  however  may be higher due to numerous factors  including those enumerated above 
a significantly higher effective income tax rate could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and liquidity 
officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business  including the united states  have proposed  or announced that they are reviewing tax increases and other revenue raising laws and regulations 
any resulting changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions  costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may affect our results of operations and financial condition  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors 
the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices  and requires ongoing review of our internal control procedures 
these developments have increased our legal compliance and financial reporting costs  and to the extent that we identify areas of our disclosures controls and procedures and or internal controls requiring improvement such as the material weakness in internal controls as of december  discussed in item a herein  we may have to incur additional costs and divert management s time and attention 
any such action could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we have not yet fully determined the potential financial and compliance impact of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which was enacted in july as a public entity  the company expects these new rules and regulations to increase compliance costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
delays or a failure to comply with the new laws  rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions  the assessment of other penalties and civil suits 
these laws and regulations make it more expensive for us under indemnities provided by the company to our officers and directors 
in addition  these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors or as executive officers 

table of contents the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future

item legal proceedings lajobi focused assessment in late december  the company s lajobi subsidiary was selected by us customs for a focused assessment an evaluation by us customs of a company s ability to comply with customs requirements  and not an enforcement audit or a program intended to discover wrongdoing  of its import practices and procedures  which focused assessment commenced on january  in preparing for the focused assessment  the company found certain potential issues with respect to lajobi s import practices 
as a result  the board initiated an investigation  supervised by a special committee of three non management members of the board 
the board s investigation found instances at lajobi in which incorrect anti dumping duties were applied on certain wooden furniture imported from vendors in the prc  resulting in a violation of anti dumping laws 
on the basis of the investigation  the board concluded that there was misconduct involved on the part of certain lajobi employees in connection with the incorrect payment of duties  including misidentifying the manufacturer  shipper and description of products 
as a result  effective march   lajobi s then president  lawrence bivona  and lajobi s then managing director of operations were both terminated from employment 
promptly upon becoming aware of the issues and related misconduct described above  the company voluntarily disclosed its findings to the sec on an informal basis and is cooperating with the staff of the sec 

table of contents the company expects to complete a voluntary prior disclosure to us customs identifying certain underpayments of anti dumping duty  and remit payment of duty not paid  with interest thereon see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of anticipated anti dumping duties and related interest  including the recordation of an additional aggregate amount of  in the periods to which such amounts relate based on current assumptions and information 
the aggregate amount accrued by the company during the period commencing april  through december  with respect to anti dumping duties and related interest that it anticipates will be owed to us customs by lajobi is  which amount includes approximately  in interest 
as the focused assessment is still pending  it is possible that the actual amount of duty owed for the period covered thereby will be higher than currently accrued amounts upon completion thereof  and in any event  additional interest will continue to accrue on the amounts the company currently anticipates the company will owe until payment is made 
in addition  it is possible that the company may be assessed by us customs a penalty of up to of such duty owed  as well as possibly being subject to additional fines  penalties or other measures from us customs or other governmental authorities 
with respect to the actual amount of duty owed  and additional fines  penalties or other measures  the company cannot currently estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss  if any  in connection therewith 
the company has discontinued the practices that resulted in the charge for anticipated anti dumping duty  and the company believes that its ability to procure the affected categories of wooden bedroom furniture has not been materially adversely affected 
the company is committed to working closely with us customs to address issues relating to incorrect duties 
this combined impact of the adjustments to and the addition of specified line items in the prior financial statements resulting from the restatement is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
bivona arbitration as a result of the accrual recorded in the fourth quarter and year ended december  for anticipated duty and interest thereon owed by lajobi to us customs which accrual has been restated in the applicable periods in this k as described in the explanatory note above and the facts and circumstances discovered in the company s preparation for the focused assessment and in its related investigation into lajobi s import practices described above including misconduct on the part of certain employees at lajobi  the company concluded that no earnout with respect to the lajobi acquisition and therefore no related finder s fee was payable 
accordingly  prior to the restatement of the prior financial statements herein  the company had not recorded any amounts related thereto in the company s financial statements 
the company had previously disclosed a potential earnout payment of approximately to million in the aggregate relating to its acquisitions of lajobi and cocalo  substantially all of which was estimated to relate to lajobi 
on july   the company received a letter from counsel to lawrence bivona demanding payment of the lajobi earnout to mr 
bivona in the amount of million 
in addition  on july   the company received a letter from counsel to mr 
bivona alleging that mr 
bivona s termination by lajobi for cause  effective march   violated his employment agreement and demanding payment to mr 
bivona of amounts purportedly due under such employment agreement 
on december   mr 
bivona initiated an arbitration proceeding under the auspices of jams  with respect to these issues  as well as a claim for defamation  seeking damages in excess of million 
on february   the company and lajobi filed an answer thereto  in which they denied any liability  asserted counterclaims against mr 
bivona  and provided a third party complaint against mr 
bivona s brother and the lajobi seller 
because the restatement of the prior financial statements results in the technical satisfaction of the formulaic provisions for the payment of a portion of the lajobi earnout under the agreement governing the purchase of the lajobi assets  applicable accounting standards require that the company record a liability in the amount of the formulaic calculation  without taking into consideration the company s affirmative defenses  counterclaims and third party claims 
accordingly  in connection with the restatement of the prior financial statements herein  the company recorded a liability in the approximate amount of million for the year ended december  million in respect of the lajobi earnout and million in respect of the related finder s fee  with an offset in equal amount to goodwill  all of which goodwill was impaired as of december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we intend to vigorously defend against all of mr 
bivona s claims  and believe that we will prevail  based on  among other things  our affirmative defenses  counterclaims and third party claims in which case we will be able to reverse such liability  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
an adverse decision in the arbitration that requires any significant payment by us to mr 
bivona or the lajobi seller could result in a default under our credit agreement and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we are currently party to litigation that could be costly to defend and distracting to management  and if decided against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business and inability to maintain compliance with the bank covenants

table of contents customs compliance investigation following the discovery of the matters described above with respect to lajobi  our board authorized a review  supervised by the special committee and conducted by outside counsel  of customs compliance practices at the company s non lajobi operating subsidiaries  consisting of kids line  cocalo and sassy the customs review 
in connection therewith  the special committee has identified instances in which these subsidiaries filed incorrect entries and invoices with us customs as a result of  in the case of kids line  incorrect descriptions  classifications and valuations of certain products imported by kids line and  in the case of cocalo  incorrect classifications of certain products imported by cocalo 
as a result of these findings to date  the company currently estimates that it will incur aggregate costs of approximately  pretax which includes  in interest relating to customs duty for the years ended through prior to the restatement of the prior financial statements  the company recorded million in cost of sales and million in interest expense for the three and six months ended june  the period of discovery and an additional  in interest expense for the three months ended september  as a result of the restatement of the prior financial statements herein as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  the amounts previously recorded in the three and six months ended june  and interest amounts for subsequent periods have now been recorded in this k in the periods to which they relate 
in addition  based upon current assumptions and information  the company has revised its calculations of the total amount of customs duty that it anticipates will be owed to us customs and in connection therewith  has recorded additional custom duties charges in the aggregate amount of  all of which have been recorded in the periods to which they relate as part of the restatement of the prior financial statements  and has also recorded in the quarter ended december  a charge for additional accrued interest of  as the customs review is still pending  however  it is possible that the actual amount of duty owed will be higher upon its completion and  in any event  additional interest will continue to accrue until payment is made 
in addition  it is possible that the company may be assessed by us customs a penalty of up to of any such duty owed  as well as possibly being subject to additional fines  penalties or other measures from us customs or other governmental authorities 
with respect to the actual amount of duties owed  and additional fines  penalties or other measures  the company cannot currently estimate the amount of loss or range of loss  if any  in connection therewith 
promptly after becoming aware of the foregoing  the company submitted voluntary prior disclosures to us customs identifying such issues 
following the completion of the customs review  the company intends to remit to us customs the amount of duties owed and any interest and penalties thereon 
our board has also authorized an investigation  supervised by the special committee and conducted by a second outside counsel  to more fully review the customs practices at these operating subsidiaries  including whether there was any misconduct by personnel the customs investigation 
the company has also voluntarily disclosed to the sec the existence of the customs review and the customs investigation
