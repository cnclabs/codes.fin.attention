while we offer our customers a range of purchasing and deployment options  from on demand subscription to on premise term license  our business and revenue model is focused on recurring revenue 
recurring revenue growth during we continued to build on the progress made in  achieving four consecutive quarters of revenue growth  or a total of eight consecutive quarters since the beginning of recurring revenue continued to dominate our sales transactions  representing of total revenue and our saas revenue grew to a record level of million  representing growth from we continue to expect recurring revenues to run at approximately of revenues going forward 
customer retention rates in both saas and maintenance remained strong  above the level 
we believe our high retention rates are also an indication to the quality of service we provide and the quality of our customer base 
total revenues for the year were million  up million  or  from the prior year 
this increase reflects our business model change completed in  and the strategic acquisitions that broadened our market opportunity and expanded our horizon for growth in and thereafter 
total perpetual license revenue for the year was million  an increase of million from services revenue increased by from million in to million in improved operating results during we continued to manage our operating expenses carefully to ensure proper alignment with our on demand business model 
although our operating expenses increased by million  or 
table of contents  to million in  mainly due to our acquisitions  we completed during  our operating expenses are better aligned to enable us to grow our revenue and business profitability 
non gaap operating results to supplement our operating results presented on a basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  we use the following non gaap measures of operating results 
non gaap operating results are derived from gaap loss from operations adjusted for noncash or nonrecurring expenses 
we believe non gaap operating results are useful as one of the bases for measuring our operating performance  comparing the impact of our cost control measures between periods  and our ability to invest in new business opportunities 
we believe that measuring our operations using non gaap results provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and ongoing results 
we use these measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses  for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation  and for budget and planning purposes 
these measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to our board of directors 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures serve as an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
we do not consider such non gaap measures in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with gaap 
the principal limitation of such non gaap financial measures is that they exclude expenses that are required by gaap 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about certain expenses that are excluded from the gaap financial measures 
our presentation of non gaap operating results excludes stock based compensation  restructuring expenses  amortization of acquired intangible assets  patent litigation costs  acquisition related costs  and impairment of an acquired intangible asset 
in order to compensate for these limitations  we present our non gaap financial measures in connection with our gaap results 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
years ended december  in thousands gaap loss from operations exclude stock based compensation restructuring expenses amortization of acquired intangibles impairment of acquired intangible asset patent litigation costs acquisition related costs patent settlement costs non gaap income loss from operations 
table of contents our non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense consists of expenses for stock options and stock awards that we began recording in accordance with asc during the first quarter of these expenses are excluded in our non gaap financial measures because stock based compensation amounts are non cash and are difficult to forecast 
this is due in part to the magnitude of the charges which depends upon the volume and timing of stock option grants  which can vary dramatically from period to period  and external factors such as interest rates and the trading price and volatility of our common stock 
we believe that this exclusion provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because these non gaap financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for future periods with results from past periods 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses were excluded because they are not related to ongoing operations  as we believe their exclusion facilitates a more meaningful comparison to our prior year s results and to the results of other companies in our industry 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in accordance with gaap  operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets which are amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non gaap financial measures because they are non cash as we believe that this facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of other companies in our industry 
impairment of an acquired intangible asset 
we recorded a non cash impairment expense in as a result of our impairment test for long lived assets 
patent litigation costs 
patent litigation costs consist of legal expenses incurred by us in response to litigation alleging patent infringement 
we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of our peer companies 
acquisition related transaction costs 
acquisition related transaction costs consist of legal and travel expenses  earn out payments in connection with the continued employment of certain personnel  and other professional services costs 
we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of our peer companies 
patent settlement costs 
on march   callidus entered into a settlement and patent license agreement with versata and clear technology versata 
in exchange for million in cash  versata granted callidus a nonexclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid up  royalty free  worldwide license  and releases  acquits and forever discharges callidus from the claims asserted by versata against callidus 
we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of our peer companies

challenges and risks in response to market demand over the past few years  we shifted our primary business focus from providing perpetual software licenses to providing on demand software as a service 
toward the end of we also began offering our on premise products under term license arrangements 
we believe that these offerings better addresses the needs of our customers  and at the same time  provides more predictable revenue streams 
we expect perpetual license revenues to decrease in the future as customers convert to our on demand service 
while we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our transactions 
we believe one of our major challenges continues to be increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our suite of products 
during  in order to expand our product offerings and customer base we completed six acquisitions  and we recently completed an acquisition in the first quarter of we expect our revenues and expenses to increase as result of our acquisitions 

table of contents in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve  stock based compensation  valuation of acquired intangible assets  goodwill impairment  long lived asset impairment  contingent consideration and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for a more detailed discussion of these accounting policies and our use of estimates  refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we recognize 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve we estimate the uncollectability of accounts receivable  and record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of future service claims 
when providing for service remediation reserves  the company analyzes historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
if our actual service claims are higher than expected  additional service remediation 
table of contents reserves may be needed and our future results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense for restricted stock units rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we measure the value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the options  taking into account projected exercises  our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
changes in these variables could materially affect the stock based compensation in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized  but instead goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and under certain circumstances 
we perform such testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year  or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted new accounting guidance which simplifies goodwill impairment testing 
the new accounting guidance allows us to conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we then conduct a two step test for impairment of goodwill 
the first step of the test for goodwill impairment compares the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we will perform the second step of the test for impairment of goodwill 
during the second step of the test for impairment of goodwill  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value  the excess amount will be recognized as an impairment loss 
we have one reporting unit and evaluate goodwill for impairment at the entity level 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to years 
generally  amortization is based on the higher of a straight line method or the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 

table of contents contingent consideration we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration issued in business combinations using a probability based income approach 
the fair value of our liability classified contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period  with any changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense 
contingent acquisition consideration payable is included in accrued liabilities and on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for income taxes income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of those laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures for tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of newly adopted accounting pronouncements on our financial statements

services revenues  which consist of integration and configuration of the company s products as well as training  decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease from the prior year was expected as we completed our transition to our on demand subscription business model  which requires shorter and less expensive implementations 

table of contents license revenues 
license revenues  which only include perpetual license revenues  decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to the transition in our business model 
as a result  our perpetual license business in north america and emea continued to diminish in importance 
we expect to continue to enter into perpetual licenses in emerging markets  such as asia pacific and latin america  which have been slower to adopt on demand services 
we expect license revenues to fluctuate from period to period and in any case we do not expect perpetual license revenue to return to historical levels 
cost of revenues cost of recurring revenues 
cost of recurring revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased infrastructure cost attributable to the growth in on demand subscription revenue coupled with increased amortization expense of intangible assets attributable to increased costs of third party technology supporting our on demand subscription business 
the costs of recurring revenues as a percentage of related revenues remained flat at on a year over year basis 
the costs associated with supporting our on demand subscription offering are generally higher than the cost of maintenance related to our on premise license customers  as we are responsible for the full operation of the software in our hosting facility

as a result of the transition  we allocate a lower portion of the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products 
gross profit gross profit 
our overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in this was primarily because our on demand subscription revenues  which have a higher gross profit than our service revenues  accounted for the majority of total revenue in as compared to in our recurring revenues accounted for of total revenues  as compared to of total revenues in our recurring revenues gross profit remained relatively flat at for and as noted above  the cost of recurring revenues in absolute dollars increased to support the increase in on demand subscription revenues  but remained flat on a year over year basis as a percentage of revenues which increased due to sizable growth in on demand subscription revenues and our term licenses 
services gross profit decreased from in to negative in the negative services margin reflects lower than forecasted utilization due to certain customers delaying the start of our implementation projects and a decrease in our average billing rate for the first half of  offset in part by higher utilization and average billing rate in the second half of license gross profit remained relatively flat on a year over year basis

sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from to the decrease was primarily attributable to the cost cutting measures we instituted in to better align our cost base and our resources with our recurring revenue business model 
the decrease is also due to lower personnel related expenses from headcount reductions as well as a decrease in commission payments of million attributable to the decline in license revenues 
for financial reporting purposes  commission expenses associated with on demand subscription arrangements are deferred and then amortized over the term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized  whereas commission expenses related to perpetual license sales are incurred in the period the transaction occurs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates  as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines establish  among others  credit quality standards and limits on exposure to i any one security issue or issuer and ii the type of instrument 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk are short term investments  long term investments and trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we mitigate market risk by monitoring ratings  credit spreads and potential downgrades for all bank counterparties on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk  we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties as necessary 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high quality corporate debt obligations  us government obligations  and auction rate securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately months  and all investment securities had remaining maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity year or less more than year total principal amount total fair value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our non united states operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for our operations outside the united states  we generally transact business in various other currencies 
for and  approximately and of our total revenue was denominated in foreign currency 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable was denominated in foreign currency 
our exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized losses on foreign exchange transactions of million 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in us dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the 
table of contents impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  nor any losses related to forward exchange contracts for we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot make assurances that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows
