equipment 
gulf island s main yard houses its bertsch model and model plate bending rolls  a computerized vernon brace coping machine used for cutting steel in complex geometric sections  a frye wheelabrator and a us filter grit blast system  a hydraulic plate shear  a hydraulic press brake  and various other equipment needed to build offshore structures and fabricate steel components 
gulf island s west yard has a bertsch model plate bending roll  a computerized vernon brace coping machine  and various other equipment used in our fabrication business 
the brace coping machine installed in gulf island s west yard can handle pipe up to  pounds per foot and inch outer diameter compared to the capacity of the current machine in the main yard  which is  pounds per foot and inch outer diameter 
the brace coping machine in the west yard provides additional efficiencies because it can cut degrees without repositioning itself 
also  by having two machines  gulf island can double its capacity to cut braces thereby reducing idle production time in the yard 
gulf island has a computerized numeric controlled plasma arc cutting system that cuts and bevels steel up to one inch thick at a rate of two hundred inches per minute 
the system can also etch into steel for piece markings and layout markings at a rate of three hundred inches per minute 
gulf island also owns crawler cranes  which range in tonnage capacity from to tons each and service both of gulf island s yards 
gulf island may rent additional cranes on a monthly basis in times of very high activity levels 
gulf island owns rubber tired  hydraulic modular transporters kamag type that allow fabricated deck sections that weigh as much as  tons to be transported around the facility 
the transporters allow easier load out of smaller decks and provide more agility for the movement of deck sections throughout the yard than cranes 
these units are identical to the units owned by gulf marine  are easily truckable and  when used in tandum  have a capacity of  tons 
gulf island owns a deck barge which gives it the ability to move material and equipment to and from the various facilities more conveniently and reduce the cost of barge rentals and certain other transportation costs 
gulf island performs routine repairs and maintenance on all of its equipment 
gulf island s plate bending rolls allow it to roll and weld into tubular pipe sections approximately  tons of plate per year 
by having such capacity at its fabrication facility  gulf island is able to coordinate all aspects of platform construction  thereby reducing the risk of cost overruns  delays in project completion  and labor costs 
in addition  these facilities allow gulf island to participate as subcontractor on projects awarded to other contractors 
gulf island has a state of the art  fully enclosed  and environmentally friendly blast and coating facility that can operate twenty four hours a day 
the facility is automated and provides blasting and coating activities in support of our houma fabrication projects 
the design output of the facility also allows us to provide blast and paint services to the local shipbuilding industry 
the use of this equipment provides gulf island a competitive advantage by reducing labor costs 
gulf island marine owns a  ton dry dock used to supplement our marine construction operations in houma 
the dry dock is feet long by feet wide and feet wide between the wing walls 
the bottom is feet deep with foot walls above the bottom 
the dry dock is used for maintenance and repairs to third party marine vessels  as well as to launch vessels being fabricated at our facilities 
gulf island marine s panel line system  located in its west yard  consists of six individual in line fully automated systems utilized to cut  weld  and assemble panels to be used in marine vessel construction 
the first station consists of an esab avenger plasma cutting table for high speed cutting and beveling of steel plates and shapes 
the second station incorporates an ogden model osws single sided welder complete with an electro magnetic plate holding system whereby two steel plates are automatically welded together in a single pass utilizing a multiple sub arc welding process 
this process can be repeated up to four times with a result of a single panel having an overall dimension of by feet 
an esab avenger plate marking and cutting machine is positioned at the third station which lays out the welded panels  marks the applicable locations for stiffeners installation  and cuts the plate to required configurations 
the fourth station utilizes an ogden model sf stiffener fitting system to properly align and tack in place the plate stiffeners 
the fifth station consists of an ogden model sw multiple stiffener welding system whereby three longitudinal plate stiffeners can be automatically welded both sides in a single operation performing continuous or intermittent welding of the

index to financial statements stiffeners 
there is also an automated conveyor system that operates along the panel line which transfers the panels from station to station 
the sixth station is a vertical lifting system that elevates the fabricated panels to the required height for transportation to the field 
dolphin services owns three spud barges for use in connection with its inshore construction activities 
each barge is equipped with a crane with a lifting capacity of to tons 
dolphin services also owns cranes  which range in tonnage capacity from to tons each 
dolphin also owns a model tug boat with two horsepower engines 
this boat is feet long by feet wide and is used to push our three spud barges and to reduce costs on tug rentals 
gulf marine also owns crawler cranes  which range in tonnage capacity from to tons each 
gulf marine s pipe mill is equipped with a haeusler quad roll  and bertsch model  model and model plate bending roll machines for diameters ranging from foot inches to feet and one large diameter plate bending roll machine  the haeusler quad roll  for diameters ranging from feet to feet 
the two romar cnc controlled flame planers  each with four torch stations two torches per station  are used to cut steel plate up to feet wide and feet long 
the gulf marine paint facility is equipped with a pangborn shot blast machine   square feet of climate controlled staging area and feet by feet by feet paint booth that can operate hours a day 
gulf marine owns six rubber tired  hydraulic modular transporters kamag type that allow fabricated deck sections that weigh as much as  tons to be transported throughout the facility 
these transporters allow easier load out of small decks and provide more agility for the movement of deck sections throughout the yard than cranes 
these units are identical to the units used by our gulf island facilities  are easily truckable and  when used in tandum  have a capacity of  tons 
gulf marine has recently completed the installation of a panel line system in its south yard 
materials and supplies the principal materials and supplies we use in the fabrication business are standard steel shapes  steel plate  welding gases  fuel oil  gasoline and paint  all of which are currently available from many sources  and we do not depend upon any single supplier or source 
recently  prices for raw materials used to produce steel  such as iron ore and coal  have increased 
demand for steel has also increased both domestically and abroad 
standard delivery from domestic steel mills is running about to weeks on as rolled steels versus anywhere from to weeks for heat treated steels 
due to the inability of domestic mills to produce our customer s required steel grades  we are often forced to procure material from foreign steel mills 
the delivery from these foreign mills  including transit time  is currently running approximately to weeks 
steel prices have fluctuated from january to now and have increased in both january and february  but are currently very similar to market prices this time last year 
to mitigate our risk of increasing cost of materials  we often negotiate escalation clauses in our contract terms to increase the contract price with a corresponding increase of cost of materials purchased during the life of the contract 
safety and quality assurance management is concerned with the safety and health of our employees and maintains a stringent safety assurance program to reduce the possibility of accidents 
our safety department establishes guidelines to ensure compliance with all applicable state and federal safety regulations and provides training and safety education through orientations for new employees and subcontractors  daily crew safety meetings and first aid and cpr training 
we also employ in house medical personnel 
we have a comprehensive drug and alcohol program and conduct periodic employee health screenings 
a safety committee  whose members consist of one management representative and peer elected field representatives  meets once a month to discuss safety concerns and suggestions that could prevent accidents 
we also reward our employees through a safety recognition award program distributed throughout the year 
we fabricate to the standards and regulations of the american petroleum institute  the american welding society  the american society of mechanical engineers  american bureau of shipping  united states coast 
table of contents 
index to financial statements guard and customer specifications 
we use welding and fabrication procedures in accordance with the latest technology and industry requirements 
training programs have been instituted to upgrade skilled personnel and maintain high quality standards 
in addition  we maintain on site facilities for the non destructive testing of all welds  a process performed by an independent contractor 
the quality management systems of gulf island  gulf island marine  dolphin services and gulf marine are certified as iso programs 
iso is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management overseen by the international standard organization based in geneva  switzerland 
the certification is based on a review of our programs and procedures designed to maintain and enhance quality production and are subject to annual review and recertification 
customers and contracting our customers are primarily major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
we also may perform sub contract work for one or more of our competitors 
over the past five years  sales of structures and related services used in the gulf of mexico by oil and gas exploration and production companies accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our international sales fluctuate from year to year depending on whether and to what extent our customers require installation of fabricated structures outside of the united states 
sales of fabricated structures installed outside the united states comprised between and of revenue during each of the last five years  and accounted for   and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a large portion of our revenue has historically been generated by several customers  although not necessarily the same customers from year to year 
for example  our largest customers those which individually accounted for more than of revenue in a given year accounted for of revenue in all for chevron corporation  of revenue in for eni us operating co 
inc  for american electric power service corporation and for versabuild  llc  and of revenue in for bluewater industries  inc and for eni us operating co 
inc 
in addition  at december   of our backlog  which consists of work remaining on commitments received through february   was attributable to projects involving customers 
of our backlog on december   is for two customers for two deepwater projects 
the level of fabrication that we may provide to any particular customer depends  among other things  on the size of that customer s capital expenditure budget devoted to project construction plans in a particular year and our ability to meet the customer s delivery schedule 
thus  customers that account for a significant portion of revenue in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenue in subsequent years 
while customers may consider other factors  including the availability  capability  reputation and safety record of a contractor  we believe price and the ability to meet a customer s delivery schedule are the principal factors weighed by customers in awarding contracts 
our contracts generally vary in length from one month to months depending on the size and complexity of the project 
generally  our contracts and projects are subject to termination at any time prior to completion  at the option of the customer 
upon termination  however  the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
most of our projects are awarded on a fixed price  unit rate  alliance partnering or cost plus basis 
under fixed price contracts  we receive the price fixed in the contract  subject to adjustment only for change orders approved by the customer 
as a result  we retain all cost savings but are also responsible for all cost overruns 
under a unit rate contract  material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure 
the unit rates of measure will generally be amount of dollars per ton  per foot  per square foot  per item installed  etc 
a typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure that all accumulate to determine the total contract value 
profit margins are built in to the unit rates and  similar to a fixed price contract  we retain all cost savings but are also responsible for all cost overruns 
under typical alliance partnering arrangements  the parties agree in advance to a target price that includes specified levels of labor and material costs and profit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements margins 
if the project is completed at less cost than that targeted in the contract  the contract price is reduced by a portion of the savings 
if the cost of completion is greater than that targeted in the contract  the contract price is increased  but generally to the target price plus the actual incremental cost of materials and direct labor costs 
accordingly  under alliance partnering arrangements  we have some protection from cost overruns but also share a portion of any cost savings with the customer 
under cost plus arrangements  pursuant to which we receive a specified fee in excess of our direct labor and material costs  we are protected against cost overruns but do not benefit directly from cost savings 
because we generally price materials as pass through items on our contracts  the cost and productivity of our labor force are the primary factors affecting our operating costs 
consequently  it is essential that we control the cost and productivity of the direct labor hours worked on our projects 
as an aid to achieving this control  we place a single project manager in charge of the production operations related to each project and give significant discretion to the project manager  with oversight by the applicable subsidiary s president and our president 
as an incentive to control costs  each of gulf island  gulf island marine  dolphin services and gulf marine give bonuses to its employees totaling to of their separate company income before taxes depending on job position 
seasonality although high activity levels in the oil and gas industry and capacity limitations can somewhat diminish the seasonal effects on our operation  our operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours 
since most of our construction activities take place outdoors  the number of direct labor hours worked generally declines during the winter months due to an increase in rainy and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
in addition  our customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of the milder weather during such months for the installation of their platforms 
in recent years  seasonality has had less of an impact on income  mainly due to our ongoing investment in machinery and equipment and covered fabrication areas 
competition the offshore platform fabrication industry is highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of the control of offshore platform fabrication companies 
platform fabrication companies compete intensely for available projects  which are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis with customers usually requesting bids on projects one to three months prior to commencement 
our marketing staff contacts engineering companies and oil and gas companies believed to have fabrication projects scheduled to allow us an opportunity to bid for the projects 
although we believe price and the contractor s ability to meet a customer s delivery schedule are the principal factors in determining which qualified fabricator is awarded a contract for a project  customers also consider  among other things  the availability of technically capable personnel and facility space  a fabricator s efficiency  condition of equipment  reputation  safety record and customer relations 
we currently have two domestic competitors  including j 
ray mcdermott  sa and kiewit offshore services  for the fabrication of deepwater projects such as hulls  tendons  and or deck sections of floating production platforms 
in addition to these companies  foreign shipyards also compete for deepwater projects destined for both the gulf of mexico and international waters 
we believe that our competitive pricing  expertise in fabricating offshore structures and the certification of our facilities as iso fabricators will enable us to continue to compete effectively for projects destined for international waters 
we recognize  however  that foreign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create jobs where oil and gas production is being developed 
in addition  the increased transportation costs that are incurred when exporting structures from the us to foreign locations may hinder our ability to successfully bid for projects against foreign competitors 
because of subsidies  import duties and fees  taxes on foreign operators  lower wage rates in foreign countries  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  the possible imposition of tariffs on raw materials imported into the united states and other factors  we may not be able to remain competitive with foreign contractors for projects designed for use in international waters  as well as those designed for use in the gulf of mexico 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also have several domestic competitors  including j 
ray mcdermott  sa and kiewit offshore services  for platform jackets for intermediate water depths from feet to feet 
a number of other companies compete for projects designed for shallower waters 
certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we believe that while new competitors can enter the market for smaller structures relatively easily  it is more difficult to enter the market for jackets designed for use in water depths greater than feet 
this difficulty results from the substantial investment required to establish an adequate facility  the difficulty of locating a facility adjacent to an adequate waterway due to environmental and wetland regulations  and the limited availability of experienced supervisory and management personnel 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to those projects a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on preliminary engineering and design specifications by the customer and are refined together with the customer 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete a project and the price of a project at completion is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
in addition  customers have the ability to delay the execution of projects 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  including commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported as of december  of our backlog at december   is for two customers as compared to for one customer at december  million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  at december  million  or  represented projects destined for foreign locations compared to million  or  at december  depending on the size of the project  the termination or postponement of any one of our deepwater projects could significantly reduce our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on revenue  net income and cash flow 
as of december   we expect to recognize revenues from our backlog of approximately million  or  during the calendar year  and million during calendar year recognition of revenue of the backlog as presented above is based on management estimates of the application of the direct labor hours of the backlog during the current projected timelines to complete the projects 
certain factors and circumstances  as mentioned above  could cause changes in the period when the backlog is recognized as revenue 
as a result  the timing of backlog revenue recognition could differ from the periods presented 

table of contents 
index to financial statements based on the activity of the major oil and gas companies and certain engineering companies  we believe that there could be one or two deepwater projects awarded during the latter part of  with another three or four deepwater projects awarded in the last half of given the current level of deepwater projects  the potential to increase the backlog in the near term continues to come from marine related projects  where bidding activity remains steady 
government and environmental regulation many aspects of our operations and properties are materially affected by federal  state and local regulations  as well as certain international conventions and private industry organizations 
the exploration and development of oil and gas properties located on the outer continental shelf of the united states is regulated primarily by the bureau of ocean energy  management and enforcement boem of the department of interior doi 
this agency replaced the former minerals management service 
the secretary of the interior  through the boem  is responsible for the administration of federal regulations under the outer continental shelf lands act requiring the construction of offshore platforms located on the outer continental shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in compliance with these and all other regulations affecting the fabrication of platforms for delivery to the outer continental shelf of the united states 
in addition  we depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  can be affected by changes in taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry 
offshore construction and drilling in certain areas has also been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations 
until our acquisition of the gulf marine facilities  the houma navigation canal provided the only means of access from our facilities to open waters 
the houma navigation canal is considered to be a navigable waterway of the united states and  as such  is protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water borne traffic 
federal law also authorizes federal maintenance of the canal by the us corps of engineers 
the canal requires dredging to maintain its water depth and  while federal funding for this dredging has been provided for over years  there is no assurance that congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of the canal will be continued indefinitely 
if sufficient funding were not appropriated for that purpose  the houma navigation canal could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products and could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees 
these laws may provide for strict liability for damages to natural resources and threats to public health and safety  rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution 
certain environmental laws provide for strict  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances  as well as damage to natural resources 
in addition  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time we performed them 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended  and similar laws provide for responses to and liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
additionally  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the safe 
table of contents 
index to financial statements drinking water act  the emergency planning and community right to know act  each as amended  and similar foreign  state or local counterparts to these federal laws  regulate air emissions  water discharges  hazardous substances and wastes  and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances 
compliance with such environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities and compliance with various standards or procedural requirements 
we believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with current regulatory standards 
our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  primarily the occupational safety and health act and regulations promulgated thereunder 
in addition  various other governmental and quasi governmental agencies require us to obtain certain permits  licenses and certificates with respect to our operations 
the kinds of permits  licenses and certificates required by our operations depend upon a number of factors 
we believe that we have all material permits  licenses and certificates necessary for the conduct of our existing business 
our compliance with these laws and regulations has entailed certain additional expenses and changes in operating procedures  which during the last three years have resulted in annual expenditures between  and  we believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition for the foreseeable future 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation  more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies  or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may require additional expenditures by us  which expenditures may be material 
our employees may engage in certain activities  including interconnect piping and other service activities conducted on offshore platforms  activities performed on the spud barges owned or chartered by us  marine vessel fabrication and repair activities performed at our facilities  and operating vessels owned by us  that are covered in either the provisions of the jones act or us longshoreman and harbor workers act usl h 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and  instead  permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries  with generally no limitations on our potential liability 
our ownership and operation of vessels and our fabrication and repair of customer vessels can give rise to large and varied liability risks  such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures  sinkings  fires and other marine casualties  which can result in significant claims for damages against us for  among other things  personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
in addition  our operations are subject to extensive government regulation by the united states coast guard  as well as various private industry organizations such as the american petroleum institute  american society of mechanical engineers  american welding society and the american bureau of shipping 
insurance we maintain insurance against property damage caused by fire  flood  explosion and similar catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction to our facilities 
all policies are subject to deductibles and other coverage limitations 
we also maintain a builder s risk policy for construction projects  general liability insurance and maritime employer s liability insurance which are also subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
the company and our subsidiaries  gulf island  dolphin services and gulf island marine are self insured for workers compensation and usl h claims except for losses in excess of  per occurrence 
gulf marine and gulf island resources workers compensation and usl h coverage is similar to that of gulf island  dolphin services and gulf island marine  except that the coverage is subject to a  per occurrence deductible 
dolphin steel sales workers compensation and usl h coverage is similar to gulf marine and gulf island resources except that the coverage is subject to no retention per occurrence 
although management believes that our insurance is adequate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates which management considers commercially reasonable  nor can there be any assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise

index to financial statements employees our workforce varies based on the level of ongoing fabrication activity at any particular time 
as of december  and  we had approximately  and  employees  respectively 
additionally  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
the number of contract laborers we used increased from to during the year 
due to the award of significant contracts at the end of and during  we focused on hiring employees in to meet the increasing level of activity 
none of our employees are employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
our ability to remain productive and profitable depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled construction workers  primarily welders  fitters and equipment operators 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends not only upon customer demand but also on our ability to increase our labor force 
the demand for such workers is high and the supply is extremely limited  especially during periods of high activity in the oil and gas industry 
while we believe our relationship with our skilled labor force is good  a significant increase in the wages paid by a wide range of other employers seeking similar skill sets could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates we pay  increase in our use of contract labor  or all of these 
additionally  reductions made  from time to time  in our labor force may make it more difficult for us to increase our labor force to desirable levels during periods of increased customer demand for our services 
if any of these occurred in the near term the profits expected from work in progress could be reduced or eliminated and in the long term  to the extent such wage increases could not be passed on to our customers  our production capacity could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 
in an effort to maintain our current workforce and attract new employees in periods of high activity  we have enhanced several incentive programs and expanded our training facility to train our employees on productivity and safety matters 
item a 
risk factors cautionary statement our business is subject to significant risks 
we caution readers that the following important factors could affect our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements contained in this report and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry 
our business depends primarily on the level of activity by oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
this level of activity has traditionally been volatile as a result of fluctuations in oil and gas prices and their uncertainty in the future 
the purchases of the products and services we provide are  to a substantial extent  deferrable in the event oil and gas companies reduce capital expenditures 
therefore  the willingness of our customers to make expenditures is critical to our operations 
the levels of such capital expenditures are influenced by  among other things oil and gas prices and industry perceptions of future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the ability of oil and gas companies to generate capital  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  local  federal and international political and economic conditions  and uncertainty regarding the united states energy policy  particularly any revision  reinterpretation or creation of environmental and tax laws and regulations that would negatively impact the industry 
although activity levels in production and development sectors of the oil and gas industry are less immediately affected by changing prices and as a result  less volatile than the exploration sector  producers 
table of contents 
index to financial statements generally react to declining oil and gas prices by reducing expenditures 
this has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will adversely affect the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
our backlog is subject to change and may be adversely affected by the loss of or failure to secure deepwater projects 
our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to  those projects as to which a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on preliminary engineering and design specifications by the customer and are refined together with the customer 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete and price at completion is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer  in that case  is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
in addition  a customer can potentially delay the execution of their project 
deepwater projects have historically represented a significant part of our backlog 
with respect to backlog at december   million  or approximately  represents mostly two projects destined for deepwater locations 
depending on the size of the project  the termination or postponement of any one of our deepwater projects could significantly reduce our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on revenue  net income and cash flow 
we might be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers 
our ability to remain productive and profitable depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled construction workers  primarily welders  fitters and equipment operators 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends not only upon customer demand  but also on our ability to increase our labor force 
the demand for such workers is high and the supply is extremely limited  especially during periods of high activity in the oil and gas industry 
while we believe our relationship with our skilled labor force is good  a significant increase in the wages paid by a wide range of other employers seeking similar skill sets could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates we pay  increase in our use of contract labor  or all of these 
additionally  reductions made  from time to time  in our labor force may make it more difficult for us to increase our labor force to desirable levels during periods of increased customer demand for our services 
if any of these occurred in the near term  the profits expected from work in progress could be reduced or eliminated and  in the long term  to the extent wage increases could not be passed on to our customers  our production capacity could be diminished and growth potential could be reduced 
the dangers inherent in our operations and the limits on insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability costs and materially interfere with the performance of our operations 
the fabrication of large steel structures involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and suspension of operations 
the failure of such structures during and after installation can result in similar injuries and damages 
in addition  our employees may engage in certain activities  including interconnect piping and other service activities conducted on offshore platforms  activities performed on the spud barges owned or chartered by us  marine vessel fabrication and repair activities performed at our facilities  and operating vessels owned by us  that are covered in either the provisions of the jones act or usl h 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and  instead  permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries  with generally no limitations on our potential liability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our ownership and operation of vessels can give rise to large and varied liability risks  such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures  sinking  fires and other marine casualties  which can result in significant claims for damages against both us and third parties for  among other things  personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
litigation arising from any such occurrences may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
in addition  due to their proximity to the gulf of mexico  our facilities are subject to the possibility of physical damage caused by hurricanes or flooding  as occurred in although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise 
claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability 
in addition  changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 
the availability of insurance that covers risks we and our competitors typically insure against may decrease  and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles  higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms

the dock will need to be drained to determine the extent of the damage and commence necessary repairs 
to prevent further flooding  the company has designed and is constructing a coffer cell to drain the dock and complete repairs to the slab so that it can be utilized during the fabrication stage of the williams gulfstar fps gs hull project 
the estimated cost to construct the coffer cell is approximately million and the cost to repair the slab is estimated between million and million  depending on the extent of damage 
however  the final repair costs will not be known until the dock can be drained and accordingly  the aggregate costs of repairs remains subject to change 
the company currently estimates that approximately million to million of the cost to build the coffer cell will only be used for the williams project and accordingly will be included in its estimated project cost 
the remaining cost will be capitalized as property as part of the graving dock or as inventory for use on future projects after its removal upon completion of the williams project 
the estimated costs to repair the slab to the dock will be expensed when incurred between march and june we fully intend to file one or more claims with our insurance carriers for what we believe are allowable costs under the terms of our policies 
recoveries under these policies will be recognized in the period when we have determined collection from the carriers is probable  which may be different than the periods that the costs are expended 
it is unknown at this time what  if any  portion of the cost to build the coffer cell or repair the slab will be covered by insurance 
at december   we incurred approximately  of costs related to the construction of the coffer cell and repair of the graving dock 
our industry is highly competitive 
the offshore platform industry is highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of our control 
contracts for our services are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis  and our customers consider many factors when awarding a job 
these factors include price  the contractor s ability to meet the customer s delivery schedule  and to a lesser extent  the availability and capability of equipment  and the reputation  experience and safety record of the contractor 
although we believe that our reputation for safety and quality service is good  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 
we compete with both large and small companies for available jobs  and certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  because of subsidies  import duties and fees  taxes imposed on foreign operators and lower wage rates in foreign countries  along with fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and other factors  we may not be able to remain competitive with foreign contractors for projects designed for use in international locations as well as those designed for use in the gulf of mexico 
see business and properties competition for more information regarding the competitive nature of our industry 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competitive pricing common in the marine construction industry may not provide sufficient protection from cost overruns 
as is common in the offshore platform fabrication industry  a substantial number of our projects are performed on a fixed price basis  although some projects are performed on an alliance partnering or cost plus basis 
under fixed price or unit rate contracts  we receive the price fixed in the contract  subject to adjustment only for change orders placed by the customer 
under a unit rate contract  material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure 
the unit rates of measure will generally be an amount of dollars per ton  per foot  per square foot  per item installed  etc 
a typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure that all accumulate to determine the total contract value 
profit margins are built in to the unit rates and  similar to a fixed price contract  we retain all cost savings but are also responsible for all cost overruns 
under typical alliance partnering arrangements  the parties agree in advance to a target price that includes specified levels of labor and material costs and profit margins 
if the project is completed at less cost than that targeted in the contract  the contract price is reduced by a portion of the savings 
if the cost to completion is greater than target costs  the contract price is increased  but generally to the target price plus the actual incremental cost of materials and direct labor 
accordingly  under alliance partnering arrangements  we have some protection against cost overruns but must share a portion of any cost savings with the customer 
under cost plus arrangements  we receive a specified fee in excess of our direct labor and material cost and thus are protected against cost overruns but do not benefit directly from cost savings 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
the revenue  costs and gross profit realized on a contract will often vary from the estimated amounts on which such contracts were originally based due to  among other things changes in the availability and cost of labor and material  variations in productivity from the original estimates  and changes in estimates or bidding 
these variations and the risks inherent in our industry may result in revenue and gross profits different from those originally estimated and reduce profitability or create losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  variations from estimated contract performance can have a significant impact on our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter or year 
see business and properties customer and contracting 
our method of accounting for revenue could result in an earnings charge 
most of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours worked to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we are required to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas 
our operations are directly affected by the seasonal differences in weather patterns in the gulf of mexico  as well as daylight hours 
since most of our construction activities take place outdoors  the number of direct labor hours worked generally declines in the winter months due to an increase in rainy and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
the seasonality of oil and gas industry activity as a whole in the gulf coast region also affects our operations 
our customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of the milder weather during such months for the installation of their 
table of contents 
index to financial statements platforms 
the rainy weather  tropical storms  hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast throughout the year  such as tropical storm lee in  may also affect our operations 
accordingly  our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  depending on factors outside of our control 
as a result  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we depend on key personnel 
our success depends to a great degree on the abilities of our key management personnel  particularly our corporate officers and other high ranking executives 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could adversely affect us 
we depend on significant customers 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of major and independent oil and gas companies  although not necessarily the same customers from year to year 
because the level of fabrication that we may provide to any particular customer depends  among other things  on the size of that customer s capital expenditure budget devoted to platform construction plans in a particular year and our ability to meet the customer s delivery schedule  customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenue in subsequent years 
for example  our largest customers those which individually accounted for more than of revenue in a given year accounted for of revenue in all for chevron corporation  of revenue in for eni us operating co 
inc  for american electric power service corporation and for versabuild  llc  and of revenue in for bluewater industries  inc and for eni us operating co 
inc 
the loss of a significant customer for any reason  including a sustained decline in that customer s capital expenditure budget or competitive factors  can result in a substantial loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance 
the nature of our industry subjects us to compliance with regulatory and environmental laws 
our operations and properties are materially affected by state and federal laws and other regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general  and are also subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees 
further  compliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex  stringent and expensive 
many impose strict liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety  rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to its negligence or fault 
certain environmental laws provide for strict  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances  as well as damage to natural resources 
in addition  we could be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
we believe that our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state pollution control and environmental protection laws and regulations 
we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations 
however  such environmental laws are changed frequently 
sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution 
we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will materially adversely affect our future operations and financial results 
see business and properties government and environmental regulations 
the demand for our services is also affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally 
offshore construction and drilling in certain areas has also been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
to the extent laws are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations 
our business is highly dependent on our ability to utilize the houma navigational canal 
the houma navigation canal provides the only means of access from our louisiana facilities to open waters 
the houma navigation canal is considered to be a navigable waterway of the united states and  as such  is protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water borne traffic 
federal law also authorizes federal maintenance of the canal by the united states corps of engineers 
the canal requires bi annual dredging to maintain its water depth and  while federal funding for this dredging has been provided for over years  there is no assurance that congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of the canal will be continued indefinitely 
if sufficient funding were not appropriated for that purpose  the houma navigation canal could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products and could result in material and adverse affects on our cash flow  operations and financial position 
our oil and gas fabrication operations may continue to be adversely affected by the deepwater horizon incident 
in april  the drilling rig deepwater horizon  which was engaged in deepwater drilling operations in the gulf of mexico  sank after an explosion and fire  resulting in one of the most significant oil spills in us history 
as a result  on may   the doi imposed a six month moratorium on offshore deepwater drilling operations  the enforcement of which was preliminarily enjoined 
on july   the doi imposed another similar moratorium set to expire november  as a result  deepwater drilling operations in the gulf of mexico were suspended 
on october   the doi lifted the moratorium on deepwater drilling 
although the moratorium has been lifted and permitting has resumed  the incident has resulted in increased exploration and production costs and increased regulation of deepwater drilling operations 
the incident also resulted in greater difficulty in obtaining drilling permits  which have been issued at a much slower pace than in the years before the incident 
any one or more of these may cause some of our customers to decrease or eliminate drilling activities in the gulf of mexico  which could have a material adverse effect on our business

direct labor hours are hours worked by employees directly involved in the production of our products 
our backlog is based on management s estimate of the number of direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenues to be recognized with respect to  those projects for which we have a signed contract and a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials 
the backlog as of each year end also includes commitments received following december st  as described in item 
table of contents 
index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii our ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii our ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends in oil and gas prices  expectations of future oil and gas prices  changes in technology and changes in the regulatory environment  including new permitting processes and increased regulation imposed on domestic oil and gas exploration by the bureau of ocean energy  regulation and enforcement 
we believe conditions brought on by the deepwater horizon incident in have improved and  with oil prices currently stable at between and per barrel  capital outlay and bidding activity by oil and gas producers have increased 
we believe margins will begin to improve as production volumes increase based on projects currently in our backlog 
cost reduction measures were taken during the last two years and will continue to be monitored as production levels increase 
we will continue to focus on managing the increasing costs of raw materials and maintaining our labor force 
in the longer term  demand for our products and services will continue to depend largely upon prices for oil and gas and our customer s cost of regulatory compliance  which at this time is difficult to predict 
backlog our backlog is based on management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete  and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to those projects a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to written contracts  letters of intent or other forms of authorization 
often  however  management s estimates are based on preliminary engineering and design specifications by the customer and are refined together with the customer 
as engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made  management s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete a project and the price of a project at completion is likely to change 
in addition  all projects currently included in our backlog are subject to termination at the option of the customer  although the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination and  in some instances  cancellation fees 
in addition  customers have the ability to delay the execution of projects 
as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  including commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported as of december  of our backlog at december   is for two customers as compared to for one customer at december  million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  at december  million  or  represented projects destined for foreign locations compared to million  or  at december  depending on the size of the project  the termination or postponement of any one of our deepwater projects could significantly reduce our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on revenue  net income and cash flow 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as of december   we expect to recognize revenues from our backlog of approximately million  or  during the calendar year  and million during calendar year recognition of revenue of the backlog as presented above is based on management estimates of the application of the direct labor hours of the backlog during the current projected timelines to complete the projects 
certain factors and circumstances  as mentioned above  could cause changes in when the backlog is recognized as revenue thus  the timing of backlog revenue recognition could differ from the periods presented 
based on the activity of the major oil and gas companies and certain engineering companies  we believe that there could be one or two deepwater projects awarded during the latter part of  with another three or four deepwater projects awarded in the last half of given the current level of deepwater projects  the potential to increase the backlog in the near term continues to come from marine related projects  where bidding activity remains steady 
workforce during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to contract laborers 
due to the award of significant contracts at the end of and during  we focused on hiring employees in to meet the increasing level of activity 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  we would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if a particular capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity  such as depreciation  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
these indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is probable 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable

this reduction in income caused a decrease in our estimated federal qualified production activities income deduction and an increase in louisiana state income tax apportionment in as compared to  reducing the overall income tax benefit recorded in compared to income tax expense recorded in comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the following factors contributed to the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  man hours worked have decreased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to million during the twelve month period ended december   representing a decrease of 
the most significant impact of the reduction in man hours worked was to our texas facility which is a direct result of the reduction in new job awards for deepwater projects 
since  the majority of the work performed at our texas facility was on larger deepwater projects 
the mindoc hull was the last large deepwater project fabricated in our texas facility and it sailed in november until november   the fabrication awards for the facility have been limited to large diameter tanks  multi size modules and a  ton lifting system 
consequently  the decrease in activity at our texas facility during contributed to the majority of the decrease in man hours

the reduction in general and administrative expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  was primarily due to a reduction in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs 
also contributing to the reduction of general and administrative costs was a reduction in professional service fees

the acquisition included fabrication  warehouse and office space totaling  square feet 
during the fourth quarter of  the graving dock flooded unexpectedly when soil washed out from under the graving dock floor  allowing water from the gulf intracoastal waterway to enter the dock through the floor and causing a portion of the graving dock slab to fracture 
the dock will need to be drained to determine the extent of the damage and commence necessary repairs 
to prevent further flooding  the company has designed and is constructing a coffer cell to drain the dock and complete repairs to the slab so that it can be utilized during the fabrication stage of the williams gulfstar fps gs hull project 
the estimated cost to construct the coffer cell is approximately million and the cost to repair the slab is estimated between million and million  depending on the extent of damage 
however  the final repair costs will not be known until the dock can be drained and accordingly  the aggregate costs of repairs remains subject to change 
the company currently estimates that approximately million to million of the cost to build the coffer cell will only be used for the williams project and accordingly will be included in its estimated project cost 
the remaining cost will be capitalized as property as part of the graving dock or as inventory for use on future projects after its removal upon completion of the williams project 
the estimated costs to repair the slab to the dock will be expensed when incurred between march and june the company does have insurance coverage available and fully intends to file a claim for what are determined to be allowable costs under the terms of these insurance policies 
recoveries under these policies will be recognized in the period when the company has determined collection from the carriers is probable  which may be different than the periods when the costs are expended 
however  it is unknown at this time what  if any  portion of the costs to build the coffer cell or repair the slab will be covered by insurance
