actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary statement and risk factors contained in item a above 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september for ease of presentation  september is utilized consistently throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to represent the fiscal year end date 
 and were all week fiscal years 
all date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year unless otherwise stated 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the rollmet product line  formerly included within the commercial systems segment  has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and therefore certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
unless otherwise noted  disclosures pertain to our continuing operations 
overview and outlook we have a diversified and balanced business  serving both government and commercial markets 
both of these businesses faced challenges during in government systems  a downturn in us defense spending contributed to the eight percent reduction in sales 
in commercial systems  we experienced strong growth in the air transport market  while sales to the business aviation market were impacted by the bankruptcy of one of our business jet manufacturing customers 
the seven percent increase in commercial systems revenues during was not enough to offset the reduction in our defense business  as total company sales declined two percent for the year 
despite the revenue decline  earnings per share from continuing operations increased five percent and both businesses improved segment operating margins over  with commercial systems posting a basis point increase from the prior year and government systems posting a basis point increase from the prior year 
as part of our continued response to these challenges we recorded a restructuring charge to reduce our cost structure and position us for improved performance in and beyond 
we also exercised the flexibility of our balance sheet during and issued million of percent fixed rate debt 
we used the proceeds from this debt  supplemented by available cash on hand  to repurchase approximately million shares of common stock during the year  reducing our outstanding share count by percent from in addition  in april our board of directors approved a percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend paid on common stock  raising the amount to per share 
we generated the following results for sales of billion diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of operating cash flow of million capital expenditures of million looking forward to  we anticipate the following total sales in the range of billion to billion diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of to cash provided by operating activities in the range of million to million capital expenditures of about million our company remains financially strong and looking out over the next three to five years  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of improved market conditions when they arrive 
in government systems  we expect us military budgets to eventually stabilize and we continue to enhance our international strategies and adjust our infrastructure when necessary 
in commercial systems  we have key positions on several air transport platforms with boeing and airbus and expect to benefit from strong order backlogs for these aircraft 
in the business and regional jet market  we have expanded our market share over the past several years  winning positions on a variety of aircraft with customers around the globe  including bombardier  embraer and gulfstream 
we believe our company has a proven ability both to react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans 
our fundamental strategies continue to serve us well the balance between our commercial and government businesses  the diversification of our customer base and product offerings  our focus on innovation through r d  and the integration of our business through our shared service operating model 
balance we feel our business is characterized by its balance  in terms of market segment  geographic regions and product and customer sales mix 
we strive to maintain a balance between our government and commercial systems businesses  believing that the segments are complementary to one another 
over the past three years  we have restored some of the balance between our business segments  as about percent of our sales were attributable to the government systems business in  compared to percent in looking forward to  we expect this trend to continue as we anticipate commercial systems to account for nearly half of our revenues 
diversification our business derives its revenue streams from a large number of customers  products  solutions  geographic regions and markets 
our government systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers  including the us department of defense  state and local governments  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
our commercial systems business serves customers ranging from the world s largest aircraft manufacturers and airlines to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace 
this diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios 
innovation a well funded and comprehensive r d program is a foundational aspect of our company 
our focus on developing unique solutions to address our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards r d programs 
this investment in r d has allowed us to develop new systems  products and software solutions for our customers which will continue to be the growth engine for our company 
integration we have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared service operating platform 
under our shared service operating model  certain functions and processes are utilized for the benefit of the entire organization 
the integrated nature of our business also allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry 
this integration is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays  communication  navigation and surveillance  through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both government and commercial systems 
our cost structure includes substantial investments in company funded r d expense  leased facility and equipment costs and other non variable items such as depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
by applying common tools and systems across our businesses  we can better manage our fixed cost structure and maximize our r d investments as technological advancements developed by one side of our business may be shared with the other 
one of the key metrics that we often use to describe changes in operating income for each segment is the incremental or reduced earnings derived from higher or lower sales volumes 
similarly  the variable gross margin derived from these incremental or reduced earnings is often used to describe changes in operating margins computed as segment operating earnings as a percent of segment sales 
by leveraging the fixed costs present in our shared service operating model  we typically can deliver higher earnings on incremental sales volumes as variable gross margins for our core products and services in commercial systems tend to be approximately to percent 
variable gross margins in our government systems business can often approximate those realized in commercial systems  as a significant portion of government systems revenues are derived from firm fixed price contracts with commercial terms 
the variable gross margin realized by government systems on cost reimbursable contracts and early stage development programs  however  tends to be lower 
we calculate our variable gross margin as segment sales less direct cost of sales  which includes direct materials  labor and applicable overhead allocations 
other components of cost of sales  such as company funded r d expense are excluded from variable gross margins 
in this regard  variable gross margins are typically in excess of total segment operating margins  as total segment operating earnings contemplate all segment costs  including company funded r d expense and selling  general and administrative costs

consolidated financial results sales in millions us non us total percent increase decrease sales are attributed to geographic region based on the location of our customers 
sales for compared to total sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a million reduction in government systems sales  partially offset by a million increase in commercial systems sales 
refer to a detailed discussion of sales by segment in and in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to lower sales to the us government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the government systems sales section below  and a reduction in sales to a domestic business jet manufacturer  hawker beechcraft  who declared bankruptcy in this reduction was partially offset by higher sales to boeing across various platforms and increased sales of aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers  as discussed in the commercial systems sales section below 
non us sales increased by million  or percent  as sales to non us aircraft manufacturers like airbus and bombardier increased and aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the us were higher 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in government systems sales resulting from lower sales to foreign ministries of defense 
sales for compared to total sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to a million increase in commercial systems sales partially offset by a million reduction in government systems sales 
incremental sales from acquisitions  principally the december acquisition of ar group  inc air routing  contributed million  or less than percentage point of revenue growth 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment in and is found in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales increased million  or percent  primarily attributable to higher commercial systems sales to boeing and increased sales of our aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers  including incremental service sales from the air routing acquisition  partially offset by lower sales to the us government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the government systems sales section below 
non us sales increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the combined impact of higher commercial systems sales to non us business original equipment manufacturers oems such as bombardier and increased aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the us cost of sales in millions total cost of sales percent of total sales cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes r d  raw material  labor  facility  product warranty  depreciation  amortization and other related expenses 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million decrease in cost of sales resulting from the million reduction in sales volume  as discussed in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation costs million reduction in company funded r d expense  as explained below above items were partially offset by million increase from higher restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in as compared to for  million of restructuring and asset impairment charges were classified within cost of sales  compared to million in  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements million increase primarily attributable to the million increase in warranty cost detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and higher retirement benefit expenses  as described in the retirement plans section below the decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower employee incentive compensation costs and reduction in company funded r d expense 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million increase resulted from the million of net sales growth discussed in the commercial systems and government systems financial results sections below million increase was attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses million increase resulted from the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in which were classified within cost of sales  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements above items were partially offset by a million reduction to cost of sales attributable to lower defined benefit pension expense  as discussed in the retirement plans section below the decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily due to a favorable change in sales mix resulting from higher commercial systems sales and lower government systems revenue 
research and development expense r d expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows in millions customer funded government systems commercial systems total customer funded company funded government systems commercial systems total company funded total research and development expense percent of total sales we make significant investments in research and development to allow our customers to benefit from the latest technological advancements 
total research and development expense is comprised of both company funded and customer funded r d expenditures 
customer funded r d expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are typically accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
company funded r d expenditures relate to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products and are expensed as incurred  as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
company funded r d expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in r d activities  engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs 
in addition to the r d expenditures shown in the table above  we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering effort incurred during the development phase of programs when the customer has provided us a long term supply arrangement and a contractual guarantee for reimbursement 
refer to the research and development section found in item and the critical accounting policies section found in item below for further discussion of our incremental investments in pre production engineering effort 
total r d expense decreased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense decreased million from to government systems accounted for million of this decrease  as certain development programs were terminated for convenience by the us government and spending on other programs slowed during a transition out of the development phase into production 
the million decrease in company funded r d was also driven by government systems and was attributable to the completion of development effort for networked communication  airborne communication and navigation products  as well as savings realized from our previously announced decision to cease further discretionary investments in the public safety vehicle product line 
total r d expense increased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased million from to  primarily due to a million increase within government systems that was largely attributable to effort on new development programs such as the kc a tanker  e special mission aircraft and the common range integrated instrumentation system criis programs 
an additional million increase resulted from commercial systems  driven by increased effort on various business and regional jet platforms 
the million increase in company funded r d was primarily within commercial systems and was largely driven by increased effort towards development of next generation avionics for business aircraft and incremental effort related to our content on the boeing aircraft 
looking forward to  total r d expense is expected to be approximately million 
we expect a reduction in customer funded r d expense  primarily within government systems  and anticipate company funded r d expenditures to be relatively flat when compared to in addition  we expect a million net increase in pre production engineering costs during refer to additional discussion of pre production engineering costs in the critical accounting policies section found in item below 
selling  general and administrative expenses in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of total sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or r d activities 
these activities include marketing and business development  finance  legal  information technology and other administrative and management functions 
total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million due to higher bad debt expense resulting from the customer bankruptcies described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements partially offset by a million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation and other savings attributable to headcount reduction and restructuring actions total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million from higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases million increase resulting from the combined impact of pursuing international business opportunities including the opening and staffing of new offices internationally  higher bid and proposal costs and an increase in other selling costs and activities million of incremental sg a expense from acquisitions  primarily air routing interest expense in millions interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to additional interest expense associated with the million of long term debt issued in november of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below for more detail regarding outstanding debt

income tax expense from continuing operations in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate as detailed below statutory tax rate state and local income taxes research and development credit domestic manufacturing deduction tax settlements other effective income tax rate the difference between our effective income tax rate in and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the benefit from the settlement of certain tax matters  the tax benefits derived from the federal research and development tax credit federal r d tax credit  which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental r d expenditures  and the domestic manufacturing deduction under section dmd  which provides a tax benefit on us based manufacturing 
the effective income tax rate in increased from primarily due to the differences in the availability of the federal r d tax credit which expired december  this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact in of the internal revenue service irs completing its examination of the taxable years ended september  and the effective income tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal r d tax credit which had previously expired on december  on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of was enacted which reinstated and extended the federal r d tax credit from january  to december  and reduced our effective income tax rate by about percent 
the effective income tax rates for  and include a tax benefit related to the dmd 
the dmd tax benefit available in was being phased in by statute and was therefore lower than the full dmd tax benefit which became effective beginning in fiscal year net income and diluted earnings per share in millions  except per share amounts income from continuing operations percent of sales income from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations diluted earnings per share weighted average diluted common shares net income for decreased percent to million from net income of million for diluted earnings per share increased percent to for compared to for the rate of increase in diluted earnings per share benefited from the positive impact of our share repurchase program 
net income and earnings per share for includes a million charge  or per share  attributable to the net restructuring and asset impairment charges described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income and earnings per share for includes a million gain per share from the divestiture of the rollmet product line and also includes an offsetting charge of million per share related to restructuring actions 
net income and earnings per share for benefited from higher earnings in commercial systems as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section below 
this benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense  as explained in the income tax section above  and the reduction in government systems segment earnings described in the government systems financial results section below 
net income for increased percent to million from net income of million for diluted earnings per share increased percent to for compared to for net income and earnings per share for includes a million gain per share from the divestiture of the rollmet product line and also includes an offsetting charge of million per share related to certain restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher earnings from commercial systems as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section below  partially offset by a reduction in government systems earnings as discussed in the government systems financial results section below 
the impact of the restructuring and asset impairment charge was included in income from continuing operations while the gain on sale of the divested rollmet product line was included in discontinued operations 
the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the positive impact of our share repurchase program 
segment financial results government systems overview and outlook our government systems business provides avionics  communication products  surface solutions and navigation products to the us department of defense  other ministries of defense  other government agencies and defense contractors around the world 
these systems  products and services support airborne fixed and rotary wing  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and non us governments  which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits 
in august  congress enacted the budget control act of which imposes spending caps and certain reductions in security spending over a ten year period through absent additional congressional action  further budget cuts or sequestration as outlined in the budget act will be implemented on january  if the sequestration process is implemented in january as currently mandated  there could be a significant adverse impact to our company and to the defense industry in general 
further  in years when the us government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year september  government operations typically are funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the us government to continue to operate  but does not authorize new spending initiatives 
during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  we may experience delays in procurement of products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods 
our fiscal year guidance for government systems incorporates the anticipated impact of sequestration 
we expect government systems revenues to decrease by approximately percent in as compared to  with about half of the year over year decline resulting from the impact of sequestration 
the remaining expected net decline is primarily driven by approximately million reduction resulting from programs transitioning out of the development phase  with full scale production not expected to occur until after lower product deliveries of our defense advanced gps receivers and satellite communication terminals delays in the eurofighter tranche iii and reductions from lower sales of joint helmet mounted cueing systems for military fixed wing aircraft items above are expected to be partially offset by increased deliveries of joint tactical radio system manpack radios and firestorm targeting systems and higher sales on tanker transport aircraft platforms we project government systems segment operating margins to be approximately percent  as the benefits from restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives should mostly offset the adverse impact from lower revenue 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include overall funding and prioritization of the us and us defense budgets  including unanticipated impacts of sequestration and other provisions of the budget control act of that are set to be implemented in january delayed  reduced or canceled funding for programs we have won potential impact of geopolitical and economic events our ability to execute to our internal performance plans and cost reduction initiatives our ability to win new business  successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements for additional disclosure on government systems segment results see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
government systems sales the following table presents government systems sales by product category in millions avionics communication products surface solutions navigation products total percent decrease beginning in  we began presenting sales for government systems based upon differences in the underlying product technologies and markets served 
government systems sales for the year ended september  have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
government systems sales for compared to avionics sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million increase resulting from the combined impact of development effort on the kc a  kc and kc tanker programs million increase in sales on the saudi f fighter program partially offset by reductions to revenue of million  primarily attributable to decreased sales for the kc global air traffic management program and lower deliveries on c transport  ch rotary wing and p special mission aircraft communication products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction due to the completion of a program to provide transportable cellular capabilities in afghanistan million decrease resulting from the combined impact of a program termination for ground mobile radios and reduced funding authorizations on the us department of defense fab t family of advanced beyond line of sight terminals initiative surface solutions sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the us government during million decrease resulting from the combined impact of fewer deliveries of iforce public safety vehicle systems as we exited this product line and a reduction in joint precision approach and landing system program revenues as it transitions from development into production remaining decrease of million was due to a variety of items  including fewer deliveries of soldier optronics products and a decline in electronic warfare solution program revenues navigation products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to an million reduction in revenue from fewer deliveries of our defense advanced gps receiver products as troop deployments wind down in afghanistan and iraq 
government systems sales for compared to avionics sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million increase resulting from the combined impact of low rate initial production sales on an e special mission aircraft program and development effort on the recently awarded kc a tanker program million increase from higher rotary wing avionics sales on various platforms above items were partially offset by a million reduction in sales from the completion of the kc global air traffic management program communication products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a million net reduction in satellite communication program revenues  driven by the combined impact of a recently completed upgrade program and the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the us government 
surface solutions sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the us government and lower sales of soldier system optronics products that were adversely impacted by delayed funding authorizations from the us government million decrease resulting from lower deliveries of iforce public safety vehicle systems above items were partially offset by million of increased development revenues for the common range integrated instrumentation system program navigation products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to lower sales of gps based products 
government systems segment operating earnings in millions segment operating earnings percent of sales government systems operating earnings for compared to government systems operating earnings were million  or percent of sales  for compared to operating earnings of million  or percent of sales  for the million decrease in government systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following million reduction in sales discussed in the government systems sales section above resulted in a million decrease to costs and a reduction to earnings of million 
the variable gross margin of percent reflects the absence of higher margin hardware sales for navigation products that occurred last year partially offset by a million benefit to operating earnings resulting from lower company funded r d expense  as explained in the cost of sales section above remaining variance of million was primarily attributable to a benefit from lower employee headcount and incentive compensation costs  partially offset by higher warranty expense and an increase in employee medical and retirement benefit costs  as explained in the cost of sales section above the increase in government systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was driven by the decline in company funded r d expense and lower employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by the adverse impact of lower sales 
government systems operating earnings for compared to government systems operating earnings were million  or percent of sales  for compared to operating earnings of million  or percent of sales  for the million decrease in government systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following million reduction attributable to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses driven by higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases as discussed in the sg a section above million reduction in sales volume discussed in the government systems sales section above resulted in a million reduction to costs and lower operating earnings of million  at a variable gross margin of percent above items were partially offset by a million net benefit to operating earnings resulting from the combined impact of lower pension costs  as discussed in the retirement plans section below  and a million reduction in warranty expenses primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in to reduce warranty reserves government systems operating earnings as a percent of sales were relatively flat from to commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  corporate profits and the financial condition of airlines worldwide 
we expect commercial systems sales to increase by about percent in compared to  primarily due to the following sales to aircraft oems are expected to increase by high single digits across both the air transport and business and regional markets 
sales to air transport aircraft oems should benefit from anticipated production rate increases for the boeing aircraft and other legacy boeing and airbus aircraft 
business and regional jet oem sales should also improve as the result of modest production rate increases across most oem customers aftermarket sales for are expected to increase by low double digits 
the sales increase is expected to be driven by initial revenue from airspace mandates  business jet cockpit upgrades and higher service and support revenue across both market segments partially offset by an expected decrease of approximately percent in sales of wide body in flight entertainment ife products and services due to our decision in to cease investing in this product area 
wide body ife relates to sales of twin aisle ife products and systems to customers in the air transport market and also includes related revenue from wide body service and support activities we expect the majority of the anticipated sales growth for commercial systems to occur in the second half of fiscal year this is primarily driven by year over year comparability issues with the timing of spares revenues on boeing aircraft  the lack of hawker beechcraft jet deliveries in and a concentration of anticipated mandate and retrofit activity towards the latter part of our fiscal we project commercial systems operating margins will expand by approximately basis points above the percent reported in  driven primarily by the anticipated revenue increase 
risks to the commercial systems business include turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel  airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event  including terrorism or a pandemic  that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market segment acceptance of our products and systems potential adverse impact from delays or reductions in oem aircraft production  including delays in the entry into service date for new aircraft for additional disclosure on commercial systems segment results see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

general corporate  net general corporate expenses that are not allocated to our business segments are included in general corporate  net 
these costs are included within cost of sales  sg a and other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
general corporate  net is summarized as follows in millions general corporate  net general corporate  net expense decreased million during as compared to primarily due to a reduction in employee incentive compensation costs  as discussed in the sg a section above 
general corporate  net expense decreased million during as compared to primarily due to a million decrease in defined benefit pension expense that is described in the retirement plans section below  partially offset by a million increase in certain sg a costs  including employee incentive compensation  as discussed in the sg a section above 
retirement plans net benefit expense income for pension benefits and other retirement benefits are as follows in millions pension benefits other retirement benefits net benefit expense income pension benefits in  we amended our us qualified and non qualified pension plans covering all salary and hourly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements to discontinue benefit accruals for salary increases and services rendered after september  concurrently  we replaced this benefit by supplementing our existing defined contribution savings plan to include an additional company contribution effective october  the supplemental contribution to our existing defined contribution savings plan was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
defined benefit pension expense income for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
pension costs did not change significantly in compared to the lower pension expense in compared to was primarily due to the change in amortization period of actuarial gains and losses 
in  we amortized actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service period of active participants  or about years 
beginning in  the amortization of such amounts changed to over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants  or about years 
this change in amortization period was attributable to the fact that almost all of the plan s participants are now considered inactive due to the discontinuance of benefit accruals for most employees  as described above 
during  the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of  million at september  to a deficit of  million at september  this was primarily due to the adverse impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension obligations from percent at september  to percent at september   partially offset by an increase in plan assets driven by improved market returns in during  the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of  million at september  to a deficit of  million at september   primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension obligations from percent at september  to percent at september  in addition  the funded status was adversely impacted by a reduction in plan assets during we expect defined benefit pension expense of million in  compared to million of pension income in the expected million increase in pension costs from to is primarily due to a decrease in our expected long term return on plan assets assumption  from percent in to percent in the higher anticipated pension cost for is also adversely impacted by an increase in the amortization of net actuarial losses  which are the result of declining discount rates over the past few years 
our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
in october  subsequent to our year end  we made a million contribution to our us qualified pension plan 
we plan to contribute an additional million in for a total million contribution  which we anticipate will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates 
we may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during to further improve the funded status of this plan 
contributions to our non us plans and our non us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits we have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees 
we have undertaken two major actions over the past several years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits in july of  the pre and post retiree medical plans were amended to discontinue benefits for employees hired after september  and establish a fixed company contribution 
additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount 
this amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we amended our retiree medical plans on june  to discontinue post prescription drug coverage effective january  post retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through medicare 
we believe the medicare prescription drug benefit is generally better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post drug plan other retirement benefits expense for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately million in financial condition and liquidity cash flow summary our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners 
the timing of our cash inflows is historically heavily weighted towards the second half of our fiscal year  particularly to our fourth quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
during  we exercised the flexibility of our balance sheet and issued million of percent fixed rate unsecured debt 
we used the proceeds from this debt  supplemented by available cash on hand  to make significant cash expenditures aimed at future growth and enhanced shareowner value  as shown below million of cash payments for share repurchases million of capital expenditures million of dividend payments in addition  we also made million of pension plan contributions 
operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash receipts from customers decreased by million to  million in compared to  million in  primarily due to the lower sales volume in as discussed in the results of operations section above and lower collections of receivables from customers  partially offset by higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognition payments for income taxes increased million to million in compared to million in due to the differences in the timing of cash tax payments resulting from the retroactive extension of the federal r d tax credit that benefited the prior year and the expiration of the federal r d tax credit that increased cash payments in the current year payments for employee incentive pay increased million 
incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during as compared to million paid in for employee incentive pay costs incurred during above items were partially offset by a decrease in payments for inventory and other operating costs of million to  million in compared to  million in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the lower sales volume in discussed in the results of operations section above the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following payments for inventory and other operating costs increased million to  million in compared to  million in the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in discussed in the results of operations section above and an increase in inventory  primarily driven by higher pre production engineering costs resulting from increased effort on programs such as the airbus a  various bombardier platforms in the business jet market  and several international rotary and fixed wing programs within government systems additional increases to inventory resulting from the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the us government  an increase to accommodate a transitional period of relocating certain production effort to other existing facilities and higher purchases of component parts to mitigate supply chain risks after the earthquake and tsunami in japan payments for employee incentive pay increased million 
incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during no incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year  accordingly  there was no payment for incentive pay above items were partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers of million to  million in compared to  million in  primarily due to the higher sales volume in as discussed in the results of operations section above and higher collections of receivables from customers  including higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognition payments for income taxes decreased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments related to the retroactive extension of the federal r d tax credit in cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the projected range of cash provided by operating activities accommodates a million expected contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan and a projected million net increase in pre production engineering costs 
we expect a majority of the projected operating cash flow to be generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
investing activities in millions cash used for investing activities the million increase in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash proceeds received from the dispositions of property and businesses decreased by million 
the majority of this decrease is due to the absence of the rollmet divestiture which occurred in the absence of proceeds of million in from the sale of a short term investment at a non us subsidiary partially offset by lower payments for the acquisition of businesses of million 
in  there were no business acquisitions as compared to million in payments in for the acquisitions of blue ridge simulation  inc and computing technologies for aviation  inc a million decrease in capital expenditures the million reduction in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following in we received million in proceeds from the divestiture of the rollmet business and million in proceeds from the disposition of property compared to million received from the disposition of property in in we acquired blue ridge simulation  inc and computing technologies for aviation  inc for million compared to the acquisition of air routing for million we received million from the sale of a short term investment at a non us subsidiary in which was purchased for million in above items were partially offset by a million increase in property additions financing activities in millions cash used for financing activities the million increase in cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash repurchases of common stock increased million to million in from million in partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt in november of absence of a million repayment of short term debt at a non us subsidiary that occurred during the million increase in cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash repurchases of common stock increased million to million in from million in repayment of short term borrowings increased by million in as short term debt of million outstanding at the end of was repaid during cash proceeds from stock option exercises decreased million to million in from million in share repurchase program cash flow from operations and the issuance of million of percent fixed rate debt in provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows in millions  except per share amounts amount of share repurchases number of shares repurchased weighted average price per share approximately million and of the and share repurchases reflected in the table above are included within accounts payable at september  and  respectively  and are reflected as a non cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
dividends we declared and paid cash dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
financial condition and liquidity we have historically maintained a capital structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets 
when combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations  this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners 
a comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of september  and are as follows september in millions cash and cash equivalents long term debt  net net debt total equity debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization calculated as total of long term debt  net total debt  less cash and cash equivalents calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity calculated as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total equity we primarily fund our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities 
as of september   approximately percent of our cash and cash equivalents resides at non us locations and may not be readily accessible for use in the us due to potential adverse income tax implications and other statutory limitations 
due to the fluctuations of cash flows  we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than days from the date of issuance 
at september  and september   there were no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
the maximum amount of short term borrowings outstanding during was million and the maximum amount outstanding during was million 
in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired  we have access to an million revolving credit facility through a network of banks that matures in  with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to billion 
these options are subject to the approval of the lenders 
our only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent  excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  based on this financial covenant was percent 
we had no borrowings at september  under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities  debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
to date  we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates 
our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets 
if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook fitch ratings f a stable moody s investors service p a negative standard poor s a a stable we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september  and september  off balance sheet arrangements as of september   other than operating leases  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our consolidated statement of financial position or variable interests in entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to our company 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of september   as well as when these obligations are expected to be satisfied 
payments due by period in millions total less than year years years thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations purchase orders purchase contracts total interest payments under long term debt obligations exclude the potential effects of the related interest rate swap contracts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
we lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases 
our commitments under these operating leases  in the form of non cancelable future lease payments  are not reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of financial position 
purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts 
purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable 
purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need 
generally  items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
we plan to contribute million to our us qualified pension plan in  which will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for in october  subsequent to fiscal year end  million of this amount was contributed to the plan 
for years beyond  the actual amounts required to be contributed to our us qualified pension plan are dependent upon  among other things  interest rates and underlying asset returns 
with the exception of certain bargaining unit plans  payments due under other post retirement benefit plans are funded as the expenses are incurred 
in addition  the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million at september   as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the following table reflects certain of our commercial commitments as of september  amount of commitment expiration by period in millions total amount committed less than year years years thereafter letters of credit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for a discussion of letters of credit 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we occasionally enter into offset agreements  required by certain customers in some non us countries  as a condition to obtaining contract awards for our products and services 
these agreements  which generally extend over several years  are customary in our industry and are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the country in which our customers operate 
these commitments may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transfer of technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  strategic alliances and transactions conducted by third parties eg  our vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies and or services  building or leasing facilities for in country operations  in country employment of a non us country s citizens and other forms of assistance in the applicable country 
the offset rules and regulations  as well as the underlying contracts  may differ from one country to another 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until contract awards for our products or services are definitive 
should we be unable to meet the offset obligations we may be subject to contractual penalties  and our chances of receiving additional business from the applicable customers could be reduced or  in certain cases  eliminated 
we historically have not been required to pay material penalties related to offset obligations and are currently in compliance with our offset commitments 
at september   we had outstanding offset obligations totaling approximately million that extend through the amounts ultimately applied against our offset requirements are based on negotiations with the customer and the cost to fulfill the obligation is typically only a fraction of the original obligation above

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 
approximately percent of our sales are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates did not have a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended september   or program investments we defer certain pre production engineering costs in inventories  net and record up front sales incentives in intangible assets collectively referred to as program investments 
these program investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to a maximum of years 
estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
this provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit 
the following provides an overview of the program investments september in millions pre production engineering costs up front sales incentives total program investments we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of a program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers 
these customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer 
these costs are deferred in inventories  net to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a units of delivery method  up to years 
this amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis and begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
the estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee  and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement  are expensed as incurred 
we also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized using a units of delivery method over the period we have received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives  up to years 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
amortization begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales  whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales 
risks inherent in recovering the value of our program investments include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program 
in particular  the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions  which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors  the availability of specialized materials and other production risks as of september   intangible assets include million of up front sales incentives related to hawker beechcraft  inc  who declared bankruptcy in we currently estimate this balance to be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying amount of program investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program 
no impairment charges related to program investments were recorded in  or while we believe our program investments are recoverable over time  the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to program investments 
due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment required to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry  we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly canceling a program is remote 
we also evaluate our amortization of program investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
the impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the program investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis 
there were no significant changes in the rate of program investment amortization and no significant cumulative adjustments recorded in  and amortization expense for pre production engineering costs and up front sales incentives for  and was as follows in millions amortization of pre production engineering amortization of up front sales incentives total amortization of program investments as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for pre production engineering costs is approximately ten years 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for up front sales incentives is approximately nine years 
anticipated amortization expense for program investments for fiscal years and beyond is summarized below in millions thereafter anticipated amortization expense for pre production engineering costs anticipated amortization expense for up front sales incentives total anticipated amortization for program investments pre production engineering costs comprise percent of our total inventory balance at september   compared to percent in the prior year 
pre production engineering costs increased million from september  to september  the majority of this increase was attributable to a million increase within commercial systems  driven by increased spending on programs with bombardier and airbus 
the remaining increase of million was within government systems 
additionally  up front sales incentives to commercial systems customers increased million from september  to september  growth in our program investments continues to be driven by the expanded market share our company successfully captured over the past several years 
commercial systems has secured positions on several key platforms in the air transport market  including the boeing  boeing and airbus a in the business and regional jet market  our pro line fusion avionics system has been selected by customers around the globe  including bombardier  embraer and gulfstream 
our customers have provided us a contractual guarantee for reimbursement on several of these programs  as such  our capitalized pre production engineering costs have increased for these programs as the company continues development efforts 
our government systems business has also contributed to the growth in pre production engineering costs  as we ramp up efforts on several international rotary and fixed wing programs that we recently won 
we expect the long term supply arrangements resulting from these recent program wins to deliver significant revenues and profits to us over the next several years  continuing over the life of the aircraft platforms which can range from ten to twenty years  as such  we believe our program investments are recoverable 
we expect the balance of our capitalized program investment costs will continue to increase over the next several years 
looking forward to  we expect pre production engineering costs to increase approximately million  primarily within commercial systems 
we primarily fund our program investments with cash generated from operating activities 
our guidance for cash provided by operating activities accommodates the anticipated increase in pre production engineering costs 
income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and  to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income  except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and primarily relate to foreign net operating losses 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits  deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows 
our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete 
discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations 
our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of  and yielded no impairments 
in addition  based upon the results of our impairment testing  none of our reporting units were at risk of their carrying value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value 
if there were a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms 
as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs has declined million from a balance of million at september   to a balance of million at september  this trend is driven by a variety of factors 
approximately million of the decline from to is attributable to the commercial systems business 
a primary source of warranty risk for commercial systems in the past related to sales of wide body in flight entertainment products and systems 
as discussed in the commercial systems results of operations section above  sales related to wide body ife have declined significantly over the past several years due to the company s previously announced decision to cease investing in this product area 
as sales volumes related to wide body ife continue to decline and warranty periods on these legacy products expire  our warranty reserve balance has also been reduced 
product reliability improvements have also favorably impacted incurred warranty costs within commercial systems  contributing to a lower warranty reserve 
the remaining decrease in our accrued warranty balance from to is primarily attributable to certain favorable adjustments recorded by government systems in  and to reduce warranty reserves for changes in estimate  as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
these reductions were driven by the completion of certain government systems programs that no longer require a warranty and a favorable impact from lower than anticipated repair costs across various product areas 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense 
the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
in  we are reducing our expected rate of return on plan assets by basis points  down to percent from the percent used in this reduction in our expected rate of return assumption will serve to increase pension costs in holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension income and pension benefit obligation for our us plans caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows in millions change in assumption assumption basis point increase basis point decrease pension obligation discount rate pension projected benefit obligation decrease pension projected benefit obligation increase expected long term rate of return on plan assets additional pension income decrease to pension income as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below  beginning in  actuarial gains and losses including those resulting from a change in the pension obligation discount rate are amortized over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants  or about years 
in  actuarial gains and losses were amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants  or about years 
this change in pension amortization period was the primary factor impacting the million decrease in pension expense from to this change in amortization period also resulted in our pension expense income being less sensitive to changes in the discount rate assumption 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the pension obligation discount rate would impact pension income by less than million 
inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior  although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory 
life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 
excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments  we had million of gross inventory on hand at september  with million of inventory valuation reserves 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pre production engineering costs are discussed in the program investments section of our critical accounting policies above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in november we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less 
percent by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
at september   we also had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million
