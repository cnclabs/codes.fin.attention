item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this report 
certain statements in this section are forward looking 
while we believe these statements are accurate  our business is dependent on many factors  some of which are discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and our business 
many of these factors are beyond our control and any of these and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements made in this report 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to the statements contained in this report to reflect events or circumstances that occur subsequent to the date of this report 
background as described above  on november   we closed the reverse merger with trimeris  inc as of november   after giving effect to the reverse merger the former stockholders of private synageva collectively owned approximately and the pre merger trimeris stockholders owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the reverse merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
as such  the financial statements of private synageva are treated as our historical financial statements  with the results of trimeris being included from november  immediately following the closing of the reverse merger  private synageva designees to our board of directors represented a majority of our directors  private synageva s senior management represented our entire senior management and the operations formerly conducted by private synageva were our only continuing development efforts 
for periods prior to the closing of the reverse merger  therefore  our discussion below relates to the historical business and operations of private synageva 
certain portions of this annual report on form k may contain information that relates to pre merger trimeris previous operations  which are no longer material to our business 
any comparison of pre merger trimeris revenues and operations with ours may not be helpful to an understanding of our results for the year ended december  or future periods 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development  and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with life threatening rare diseases and unmet medical needs 
our management team is experienced in the development and commercialization of drugs for diseases with small patient populations  including clinical and translational research  working with payors to establish reimbursement  and designing and building commercial organizations to reach highly specialized physicians to facilitate patient identification 
we have several protein therapeutics in development  including two enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage disorders and two programs for life threatening genetic conditions for which there are currently no approved treatments 
our lead program  sbc  is a recombinant human lal currently under clinical investigation in the us and eu for the treatment of patients with lal deficiency  which is a rare  devastating disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality 
sbc has been granted orphan drug designations by fda and the ema and a fast track designation by the fda 
we have not yet received approval to market this product and we are not currently commercializing any other products 
financial operations overview general our future operating results will depend on the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and will depend largely on  among other factors  the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under the section entitled risk factors in this report 

table of contents revenue we do not expect to generate any revenue from the direct sale of products currently in development for several years  if ever 
with our acquisition of trimeris  we now receive royalties from the sale of fuzeon by roche 
a significant portion of our revenues and or cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be quarterly royalty payments from roche based on sales of fuzeon  up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any 
our ability to enter into new collaborations and our receipt of additional payments under our existing collaborations cannot be assured  nor can we predict the timing of any such arrangements or payments  as the case may be 
in fiscal  we entered into a collaboration agreement with mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation mitsubishi tanabe whereby we are utilizing our proprietary expression technology for the development of a certain targeted compound  in exchange for upfront license payments and funded development 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion on this arrangement 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop drug candidates  including personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs  outside consulting services and other external costs 
research and development expense includes any costs associated with generating collaboration or grant revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  pre commerical  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
we also expense patent costs and expenses associated with maintaining our intellectual property as incurred 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  accounting and pre commerical services 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the result of the addition of fuzeon royalty revenue following the completion of the reverse merger  higher collaboration revenues and higher grant revenues as compared to the prior year 
royalty revenues of million represent the royalty payment earned from roche based on total worldwide net sales of fuzeon since the closing of the reverse merger in november collaboration and license revenue totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
grant revenues relate to a national institutes of health  or nih grant  and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we expect fuzeon royalty revenues to decrease from year to year  we expect our revenues to increase in fiscal  due to the inclusion of a full year of fuzeon royalty revenue in our results of operations and increased collaboration revenues from existing collaborators 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  change change compensation and benefits related clinical trials and manufacturing other development related external services facilities related amortization expense developed technology   n a non cash stock based compensation total research and development expense research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased spending related to our lead program sbc the increase included clinical trial costs and manufacturing fees associated with our on going sbc development as well as higher compensation expense from the hiring of additional staff to move the sbc program forward 
as part of these activities  we also incurred additional facilities expense resulting from the opening of our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities in lexington  massachusetts in september increases were partially off set by lower pre clinical expenses for as compared to the prior year 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as development for sbc and our other programs continues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher external services costs of million  including legal and accounting fees as well as pre commercial activities  and higher compensation expense of million  resulting from hiring additional staff to support public company requirements as well as pre commercial preparations 
in  we incurred approximately million in transaction related fees related to the reverse merger with trimeris 
as part of these activities  we also incurred additional facilities expense of million resulting from the opening of our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities in lexington  massachusetts in september other expense income  net other expense income  net decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the receipt of a tax grant related to the approval of our applications for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program during for  this grant program was not available 
in  we recognized other expense associated with the revaluation of preferred stock warrants 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased by approximately  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the result of higher grant revenues and higher collaboration revenues as compared to the prior year 
in march and march  we entered into collaboration agreements with a third party to develop antibodies using our proprietary expression platform 
collaboration revenues are the result of this collaboration 
grant revenues of  for the year ended december  relate to an nih grant 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  change change compensation and benefits related clinical trials and manufacturing other development related external services facilities related non cash stock based compensation total research and development expense research and development expenses increased by approximately  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased spending related to our lead program sbc and related preclinical and clinical start up costs as the program moved toward the clinic 
the increased costs included external services for preclinical work such as toxicology studies and lab research  as well as higher compensation expense from the hiring of additional staff to move the sbc program forward 
as part of these activities  we also incurred additional facilities expense resulting from the opening of our corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities in lexington  massachusetts 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase as clinical development for sbc continues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the comparative prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to higher facilities related expense of approximately  resulting from the opening of our lexington  massachusetts corporate headquarters  partially offset by lower compensation costs of other income other income increased by approximately  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the receipt of a one time tax grant related to the approval of our applications for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program during interest income interest income decreased by approximately  to  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately  to for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the decrease was due to the repayment of an outstanding loan in october interest amounts for the year ended december  included interest charges while the loan was outstanding in addition to an early payment penalty of  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have financed our operations to date primarily through the placement of our equity and debt securities and debt financings  and  to a lesser extent  license and royalty fees  contingent cash payments and research and 
table of contents development funding from collaborators  government grants and licensors 
in addition  we acquired million in cash as a result of the reverse merger with trimeris 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of investments in money market funds 
on january   we announced the closing of a million underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering  which we currently intend to use for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  preclinical and clinical trial expenditures  commercial expenditures  acquisitions of new technologies or businesses that are complementary to our current technologies or business focus and investments 
cash flows the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office  laboratory  and manufacturing facilities  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  clinical studies  outsourced manufacturing  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  pre commercial fees and legal fees 
we expect that costs associated with clinical studies and manufacturing costs as well as pre commercial planning costs will increase in future periods assuming that sbc advances into further stages of clinical testing and our other preclinical candidates move forward in development 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a net loss of million  as discussed in further detail in results of operations 
in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities and non cash items affected operating cash during the year ended december  changes in operating assets and liabilities that partially offset the cash impact of our net loss include million from a net decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  primarily due to receipt of royalty receivables that were recorded as part of the reverse merger in fiscal  increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of million as a result of an increased level of research and development spending related to our lead program and increased compensation and related costs  and  an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million from the receipt of an upfront license payment related to the collaboration arrangement with mitsubishi tanabe 
non cash items partially offsetting our net loss include depreciation and amortization of fixed assets of million  stock based compensation of million  and million from the revaluation of preferred stock warrants 
amortization related to the developed technology intangible asset contributed million to depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal  accounting for the majority of the year over year increase from fiscal net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a net loss of million 
changes in certain operating assets and liabilities affected operating cash during fiscal  include a net increase of million in our accounts receivable  prepaid expense and other current assets due to higher receivable balances associated with grant funds earned in and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses balances of million related to increased spending on toxicology studies 
non cash items impacting net loss included depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to seek to advance our orphan drug programs through clinical development and preclinical testing 
in addition  in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales  and other specified objectives 
investing activities provided million of cash in fiscal  primarily as a result of million of cash received as part of the reverse merger with trimeris  partially offset by million of cash paid for capital expenditures 

table of contents financing activities provided cash of approximately million for fiscal  primarily resulting from million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes  and  to a lesser extent  million of proceeds from the exercises of stock options 
in march  we issued million of convertible notes 
in conjunction with the reverse merger  these notes were converted to common stock  and were no longer outstanding at december  this conversion did not have a cash impact 
supplemental disclosure regarding non cash investing and financing activities in fiscal  our capitalization structure was impacted by the reverse merger with trimeris 
in conjunction with the reverse merger  million of convertible preferred stock and million of convertible notes was converted into common stock 
we also extinguished a merger related liability of million through the issuance of common stock and issued common stock to the holders of warrants in a net settlement transaction 
although each of these transactions did not directly impact our cash balance at december   they are disclosed on our statement of cash flows 
funding requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our cash balance at december  totaled million and we raised an additional million in january of  as discussed above 
we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents balances to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals 
in particular  our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for working capital to support our research and development activities for sbc and other preclinical candidates that we are seeking to develop  and to fund our general and administrative costs and expenses 
our ability to finance our operations into the future and to generate revenues will depend heavily on our ability to obtain favorable results in the ongoing clinical trials of sbc and to successfully develop and commercialize sbc we have no current source of significant research funding revenue 
we expect that our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be quarterly royalty payments from the roche based on sales of fuzeon  grant revenue and collaboration revenue  if any 
net sales of fuzeon by roche have decreased in each of the last three years and are expected to continue to decline 
we may not be able to successfully enter into or continue any corporate collaborations and the timing  amount  and likelihood of us receiving payments under such collaborations is highly uncertain 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will attain any further revenue under any collaborations or licensing arrangements 
there are a number of factors that may adversely affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing  many of which are beyond our control  including the following unanticipated costs in our research and development programs  the timing  receipt and amount of payments  if any  from current and potential future collaborators  the timing and amount of payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used in our drug candidates  and unplanned costs to prepare  file  prosecute  maintain and enforce patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees 
we may seek additional funding through debt or equity financings 
the fundraising environment for life science companies  in general  is highly volatile 
due to this and various other factors  including currently adverse general market conditions and the early stage status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may be dilutive or otherwise adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators  licensees or other third parties 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  whether through sales of debt or equity or through third party collaboration or license arrangements  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations and requirements as of december   our contractual obligations consisted primarily of operating leases for our headquarters and other facilities  and to a lesser extent  minimum contractual payments on licensed technology 
there were no additional commitments for capital purchases or other expenditures at december  our contractual obligations were as follows at december  total less than year years more than years operating leases contractual license obligations see item properties and facilities for additional information about our operating leases 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition  research and development costs  amortization of intangible assets  and income taxes 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipated  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
revenue under collaborations may include the receipt of non refundable license fees  payments based on achievement of development objectives  reimbursement of research and development costs and royalties on product sales 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services are performed or products are delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized could be adversely affected 
royalty revenue royalty revenues are recognized in the period earned  based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
following the merger with trimeris  we received royalties due to 
table of contents the development and license agreement with roche the roche license agreement 
as part of the roche license agreement  roche has an exclusive license to manufacture and sell fuzeon worldwide and we receive royalty payments equal to of worldwide net sales of fuzeon occurring from and after january  under the roche license agreement  roche may deduct from its royalty payments to us of any royalties paid to third parties which are reasonably required to allow roche to sell fuzeon in a given country  including royalties paid to novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc novartis 
to calculate the royalty revenue paid to us  a distribution charge is deducted from roche s reported net sales  and we receive a royalty on the adjusted net sales amount 
collaboration and license revenue we recognize revenue related to collaboration and license agreements in accordance with the provisions of asc topics revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc topic 
in january  we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date 
asu updates the previous multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the revised guidance primarily provides three significant changes it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  it eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration  and it modifies the fair value requirements of eitf issue by providing best estimate of selling price  or besp  in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence  or vsoe  for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
we determine the selling price of a deliverable using the hierarchy as prescribed in asc topic based on vsoe  third party evidence tpe  or besp 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
tpe is determined based on third party evidence for a similar deliverable when sold separately and besp is the price which we would transact a sale if the elements of the collaboration and license agreements were sold on a stand alone basis 
we evaluate the above noted hierarchy when determining the fair value of a deliverable 
the process for determining vsoe  tpe  or besp involves significant judgment on our part and can include considerations of multiple factors such as estimated direct expenses and other costs and available data 
we evaluate all deliverables within an arrangement to determine whether or not they provided value on a stand alone basis 
based on this evaluation  the deliverables are separated into units of accounting 
the arrangement consideration that is fixed and determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the estimated selling price 
we may exercise significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting as well as in estimating the selling prices of such units of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements  including collaboration and license agreements  entered into prior to january   guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the service or product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under this guidance  if the fair value of all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue would be deferred until all of the items have been delivered or fair value was determined 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement 
effective january   we adopted asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition using the milestone method 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is subject to considerable judgment and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position or our results of operations for any prior period 
research and development research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs  outside consulting services and other external costs 
clinical development and manufacturing costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we contract with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities and outsourced manufacturing activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flow 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial and manufacturing activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the work completed 
our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the project s status  timing and billing of services provided 
amortization of developed technology we provide for amortization of developed technology  computed using an accelerated method according to the undiscounted expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets  over a useful life of years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and operating loss carryforwards and credits 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
regardless of choice in presentation  the entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
for public entities  the amendment is 
table of contents effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which simplifies goodwill impairment tests 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing companies with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether future impairment testing is necessary 
the revised standard is effective for us on january  and will be applied prospectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in treasury backed money market funds 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not invest in auction rate securities 
as a result of the short term nature of our investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio as of december  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
foreign exchange market risk we currently have operations in the uk  and as a result  face exposure to movements in the foreign currency exchange rates of the british pound against the us dollar 
currently  our international operations do not represent a significant portion of our business  and as a result  we believe our exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant
