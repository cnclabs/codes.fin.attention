overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results for fiscal  as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
financial results and trends revenues for were million  a increase from in which we reported revenues of million 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to a significant increase in our revenues that we generated from games for smartphones  such as apple s iphone and mobile phones utilizing google s android operating system 
we believe that the migration of users from feature phones to smartphone devices  which offer enhanced functionality  will continue to accelerate in and for the foreseeable future as consumers increasingly upgrade their mobile phones 
accordingly  we have shifted our product development focus exclusively towards developing new titles for smartphones and tablet devices  such as apple s ipad  and intend to continue to devote significantly fewer resources towards selling games for feature phones in future periods 
for us to succeed in and beyond  we believe that we must increasingly publish mobile games that are widely accepted and commercially successful on smartphone and tablet digital storefronts  which include apple s app store  the google play store  amazon s appstore and microsoft s windows marketplace 
our smartphone revenues accounted for approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
our strategy for increasing our revenues from smartphones and tablets involves becoming the leading publisher of social  mobile freemium games games that are downloadable without an initial charge  but which enable a variety of additional content and features to be accessed for a fee or otherwise monetized through various advertising and offer techniques 
because our games can be downloaded and played 
table of contents for free  we are able to more quickly build a significantly larger customer base than we could if we charged users an upfront fee for downloading our games 
in addition  our social  freemium games are generally designed to be persistent experiences maintained through regular content updates 
we believe this approach will enable us to build and grow a longer lasting and more direct relationship with our customers  which will assist us in our future sales and marketing efforts 
we intend to continue to have the substantial majority of our social  freemium games be based upon our own intellectual property  which we believe will significantly enhance our margins and long term value 
our smartphone revenues surpassed our feature phone revenues for the first time on a quarterly basis in the second quarter of and continued to grow during each of the third and fourth quarters of however  continuing to significantly grow our revenues from smartphones and tablets may be challenging for us for several reasons  including we have encountered difficulties in retaining users of our games for any significant length of time after they initially download our games and only a small percentage of users ever purchase virtual currency in our games  and these factors have combined to suppress the overall average lifetime value of our users  the open nature of many of the smartphone and tablet storefronts substantially increases the number of competitive products and competitors to produce them  many of which may devote large marketing budgets to promoting their titles reducing the likelihood of consumer discovery of our titles  we have only relatively recently concentrated our efforts on developing and marketing social  freemium games  our relatively limited experience creating games that include micro transaction capabilities  advertising and offers has caused us  and may continue to cause us to have  difficulty optimizing the monetization of our social  freemium games  we historically have had more limited success in generating significant revenues from games based on our own intellectual property rather than licensed brands  and our social  freemium games may not be widely downloaded by consumers for a variety of reasons  including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity  ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts  a failure to achieve prominent storefront featuring for such games or as a result of the large file sizes of many of our games 
in addition  our revenues will continue to depend significantly on growth in the mobile games market  our ability to continue to attract new end users in that market and the overall strength of the economy  particularly in the united states 
our revenues may also be adversely impacted by decisions by digital storefront owners or our carriers to alter their terms related to the distribution of our games 
for example  during the quarter ended june   apple stopped permitting publishers to include certain types of advertising in games sold through the apple app store  and this change in apple policy has negatively impacted our smartphone revenues 
our revenues depend on a variety of other factors  including our relationships with digital storefront owners  carriers  other distributors and our licensors 
the loss of any of our key relationships could adversely impact our revenues in the future 
our net loss in was million versus a net loss of million in this increase in our net loss was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of million driven by additional personnel and facility costs associated with the acquisitions of griptonite and blammo and increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with the development and launch of our freemium titles 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our cost of revenues by million due to a decrease in royalty burdened revenues and impairments of advanced royalties  a million increase in revenues due to continued growth in sales of our smartphone games and a decrease in other income and expenses of million related primarily to lower interest charges as the mig promissory notes were fully repaid and favorable foreign exchange revaluations in compared to our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of the currencies in which we incur meaningful operating expenses principally the british pound sterling  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble  and our customers reporting currencies  as we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and these currencies fluctuated significantly in and we significantly increased our spending on sales and marketing initiatives in in connection with the launch and promotion of our social  freemium games  and we expect our sales and marketing expenditures to 
table of contents continue to increase during we also expect that our expenses to develop and port games for smartphones and tablets will increase as we enhance our existing titles and develop new titles to take advantage of the additional functionality offered by these devices 
in addition  we expect our overall operating expenses  particularly our research and development expenses  to significantly increase in due to our acquisitions of griptonite and blammo 
as a result of these acquisitions and the increased spending on sales and marketing and research and development initiatives  we expect to use a significant amount of cash in operations throughout  though at declining rates as we begin releasing products developed by the griptonite studio 
our ability to attain profitability will be affected by our ability to grow our revenues  including our ability to integrate the blammo and griptonite acquisitions and begin deriving significant revenues from the efforts of the acquired companies  particularly griptonite  and the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our recurring expenses is personnel costs  which consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for our employees 
we expect that the restructuring measures we implemented during and first  second and fourth quarters of  which primarily consisted of headcount reductions  will have a beneficial effect on our overall operating expenses  but will not fully offset the expected increases in our operating expenses 
our business has historically been impacted by seasonality  as many new mobile handset models are released in the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season 
because many end users download our games soon after they purchase new mobile phones and tablets  we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period 
however  due to the time between mobile phone and tablet purchases and game purchases  some of this holiday impact occurs for us in our first calendar quarter 
in addition  companies advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year  which affects the smartphone revenues we derive from advertisements in our freemium games 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  an increase of million from the million balance at december  this increase was primarily due to million of net proceeds we received from the underwritten public offering of common stock that we completed in january the public offering  million in cash that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of griptonite in august  and million of proceeds received from warrant exercises  option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase program 
these inflows were partially offset by million of cash used in operations  million paid under our credit facility  million of capital expenditures and  of taxes that had been withheld on the december  payment to retire outstanding promissory notes made to the former mig shareholders 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
significant transactions acquisition of griptonite on august   we completed the acquisition of griptonite pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  as amended the merger agreement  by and among glu  granite acquisition corp  a washington corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of glu sub  foundation entertainment  inc  a delaware corporation foundation  and griptonite 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  sub merged with and into griptonite in a statutory reverse triangular merger the merger  with griptonite surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of glu 
in connection with the merger  we issued to foundation  as griptonite s sole shareholder  in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of griptonite capital stock  a total of  shares of our common stock  of which  shares will be held in escrow until november  as security to satisfy indemnification claims under the merger agreement 
in addition  we may be required to issue additional shares 
table of contents not to exceed  shares or in specified circumstances pay additional cash i in satisfaction of indemnification obligations in the case of  among other things  breaches of our representations  warranties and covenants in the merger agreement or ii pursuant to potential working capital adjustments 
acquisition of blammo on august   we completed the acquisition of blammo by entering into a share purchase agreement the share purchase agreement by and among glu  blammo and each of the owners of the outstanding share capital of blammo the sellers 
pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement  we purchased from the sellers all of the issued and outstanding share capital of blammo the share purchase  and in exchange for such blammo share capital  we i issued to the sellers  in the aggregate   shares of our common stock the initial shares and ii agreed to issue to the sellers  in the aggregate  up to an additional  shares of our common stock the additional shares if blammo achieves certain net revenue targets during the years ending march   march  and march   as more fully described below 
 of the initial shares will be held in escrow until august  to satisfy potential indemnification claims under the share purchase agreement 
the additional shares will be issued to the sellers if  and to the extent that  blammo achieves certain net revenue as such term is defined in the share purchase agreement performance targets as follows i for fiscal april  through march   a  additional shares will be issued to the sellers if  and only in the event that  blammo meets its baseline net revenue goal for such fiscal year  and b up to an additional  additional shares will be issued to the sellers to the extent that blammo exceeds its baseline net revenue goal and meets its upside net revenue goal for such fiscal year  ii for fiscal april  through march   a  additional shares will be issued to the sellers if  and only in the event that  blammo meets its baseline net revenue goal for such fiscal year  and b up to an additional  additional shares will be issued to the sellers to the extent that blammo exceeds its baseline net revenue goal and meets its upside net revenue goal for such fiscal year  and iii for fiscal april  through march   a no additional shares will be issued to the sellers if blammo does not meet its baseline net revenue goal for such fiscal year and b up to  additional shares will be issued to the sellers to the extent that blammo exceeds its baseline net revenue goal and meets its upside net revenue goal for such fiscal year 
to the extent that blammo meets its baseline net revenue goal for a fiscal year but does not meet its upside net revenue goal for such fiscal year  additional shares will be issued to the sellers on a straight line basis based on the amount by which blammo exceeded the baseline net revenue goal 
blammo s baseline and upside net revenue goals for fiscal  and are as follows fiscal year baseline net revenue upside net revenue fiscal fiscal fiscal the first title created by blammo was released in the fourth quarter of and we anticipate that the first title created by our griptonite studio should be launched in the first quarter of public offering in january  we completed the public offering in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share for net proceeds of approximately million after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the underwriters of the public offering were roth capital partners  llc  craig hallum capital group llc  merriman capital  inc and northland capital markets 

table of contents private placement in august  we completed a private placement of our common stock the private placement in which we issued and sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share and warrants exercisable to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share for initial net proceeds of approximately million excluding any proceeds we may receive upon exercise of the warrants 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time these estimates and judgments are made  actual results may differ from those estimates  which could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and they require critical management estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  fair value  business combinations purchase accounting  long lived assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we generate revenues through the sale of our games on traditional feature phones and smartphones and tablets  such as apple s iphone and ipad and other mobile devices utilizing google s android operating system 
feature phone games are distributed primarily through wireless carriers and smartphone games are distributed primarily through digital storefronts such as the apple app store 
smartphone revenue we distribute our games for smartphones and tablets on digital storefronts such as the apple s app store and the google play store 
within these storefronts  users can download our freemium games and pay to acquire virtual currency which can be redeemed in the game for virtual goods 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided to the user  the price paid by the user is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied requires judgments that may have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
for the purpose of determining when the service has been provided to the player  we have determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying user to continue displaying the purchased virtual goods within the game over the virtual goods estimated useful lives 
we sell both consumable and durable virtual goods 
consumable goods are items consumed at a predetermined time or otherwise have limitations on repeated use  while durable goods are items accessible to the user over an extended period of time 
we recognize revenue from 
table of contents the sale of virtual currency and other virtual items ratably over the estimated average playing period of paying users 
where we do not have the ability to differentiate revenues from durable and consumable virtual goods  all revenues are deferred ratably over the average playing period of paying users 
while we believe our estimates to be reasonable based on available game player information  we may revise such estimates in the future as the games operation periods change 
any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual goods would be applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in game player behavior patterns 
any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual goods may result in revenues being recognized on a basis different from prior periods and may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
we also have relationships with certain advertising agencies for advertisements within our smartphone games and revenue from these advertisers is generated through impressions  clickthroughs  banner ads and offers 
revenue is recognized as advertisements are delivered  an executed contract exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability has been reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when the advertisement has been displayed or the offer has been completed by the user 
certain offer advertisements that result in the user receiving virtual currency are deferred and recognized over the average playing period of paying users 
feature phone revenue our feature phone revenues are derived primarily by licensing software products in the form of mobile games 
we distribute these products primarily through mobile telecommunications service providers carriers  which market the games to end users 
license fees are usually billed by the carrier upon download of the game by the end user and are generally billed monthly 
revenues are recognized from our games when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the game has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we consider a signed license agreement to be evidence of an arrangement with a carrier and a clickwrap agreement to be evidence of an arrangement with an end user 
for these licenses  we define delivery as the download of the game by the end user 
other estimates and judgments we estimate revenues from carriers and digital storefronts in the current period when reasonable estimates of these amounts can be made 
certain carriers and digital storefronts provide reliable interim preliminary reporting and others report sales data within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  both of which allow us to make reasonable estimates of revenues and therefore to recognize revenues during the reporting period 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
when we receive the final reports  to the extent not received within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  we record any differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues in the reporting period 
historically  the revenues on the final revenue report have not differed by more than one half of of the reported revenues for the period  which we deem to be immaterial 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations  we recognize as revenues the amounts the carrier and digital storefronts reports as payable upon the sale of our games 
we have evaluated our carrier and digital storefront agreements and have determined that we are not the principal when selling our games 
key indicators that we evaluated to reach this determination include wireless subscribers directly contract with the carriers and digital storefronts  which have most of the service interaction and are generally viewed as the primary obligor by the subscribers  carriers and digital storefronts generally have responsibility for fulfillment of the games and have significant control over the types of games that they offer to their subscribers  the limited number of digital storefronts currently available in the marketplace  
table of contents carriers and digital storefronts are directly responsible for billing and collecting fees from their subscribers  including the resolution of billing disputes  carriers and digital storefronts generally pay us a fixed percentage of their revenues or a fixed fee for each game  carriers and digital storefronts generally must approve the price of our games in advance of their sale to subscribers or provide tiered pricing thresholds  and the more significant carriers generally have the ability to set the ultimate price charged to their subscribers  and we have limited risks  including no inventory risk and limited credit risk 
fair value measurements we account for fair value in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
fair value is defined under asc as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we use a three tier hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the first two are levels in the hierarchy are considered observable inputs and the last is considered unobservable 
our cash and cash equivalents are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
as of december  and december   we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents 
level liabilities consist of acquisition related non current liabilities for contingent consideration ie  earnouts related to the acquisition of blammo 
the former blammo shareholders have the opportunity to earn additional shares of our common stock based on future net revenues generated by blammo during the fiscal years ending march   march  and march  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the blammo acquisition 
the expected number of shares to be issued in each year depends on the probability of blammo achieving the net revenue targets set forth in the acquisition agreement  and we used a risk neutral framework to estimate the probability of achieving these revenue targets for each year 
the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a digital option  which captures the present value of the expected payment multiplied by the probability of reaching the revenue targets for each year 
key assumptions for the year ended december  included a discount rate of  volatility of  risk free rates of between and and probability adjusted revenue levels 
probability adjusted revenue is a significant input that is not observable in the market  which asc refers to as a level input 
the fair value of these contingent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was  in accordance with asc  changes in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date have been recognized in general and administrative expense 

table of contents business combinations purchase accounting in the first quarter of  we adopted a new accounting standard related to business combinations  asc  business combinations asc  which revised the accounting guidance applied to business combinations 
the new standard expanded the definition of a business and a business combination  requires recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings  requires acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred  requires in process research and development to be capitalized at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment  and requires that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes 
we account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations 
the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date  these estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the preliminary purchase price allocation period  which may be up to one year from the business combination date  we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
after the preliminary purchase price allocation period  we record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in our operating results in the period in which the adjustments were determined 
long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  property plant equipment asc 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices  if applicable  or a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives but rather test them for impairment 
asc requires us to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance at least annually  which we do as of september each year  and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in our impairment reviews  we look at the goodwill allocated to our reporting units the americas  emea and asia pacific apac 
asc requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying 
table of contents amount 
the first step measures for impairment by applying the fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying the fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  and or the income approach  which uses discounted cash flows 
we have three geographic regions comprised of the americas  apac and emea regions 
as of december   we only had goodwill attributable to the apac and americas reporting units 
we performed an annual impairment review as of september  as prescribed in asc and concluded that we were not at risk of failing the first step  as the fair value of the americas and apac reporting units exceeded their carrying values and thus no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary 
as a result  we were not required to perform the second step 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  we utilized the discounted cash flow and market methods 
we have consistently utilized both methods in our goodwill impairment tests and weight both results equally and we believe both  in conjunction with each other  provide a reasonable estimate of the determination of fair value of the reporting unit the discounted cash flow method being specific to anticipated future results of the reporting unit and the market method  which is based on our market sector including our competitors 
the assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow methods were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
in  and we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  the assigning of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the assigning of goodwill to reporting units and the determining of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments and assumptions include the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including forecasted revenues and costs based on current titles under contract  forecasted new titles that we expect to release  timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and growth rates in terminal values 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the use of the market comparable approach requires judgments regarding the comparability of companies with lines of business similar to ours 
this process is particularly difficult in a situation where no domestic public mobile games companies exist 
the factors used in the selection of comparable companies include growth characteristics as measured by revenue or other financial metrics  margin characteristics  product defined markets served  customer defined markets served  the size of a company as measured by financial metrics such as revenue or market capitalization  the competitive position of a company  such as whether it is a market leader in terms of indicators like market share  and company specific issues that suggest appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular company as a comparable 
further  the total gross value calculated under each method was not materially different  and therefore if the weighting were different we do not believe that this would have significantly impacted our conclusion 
if different comparable companies had been used  the market multiples and resulting estimates of the fair value of our stock would also have been different 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  which could trigger impairment 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments  including stock options 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan  respectively  is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the determination of fair value is affected by the stock price  as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award 
generally  these 
table of contents assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
employee stock based compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment to stock based compensation expense will be recognized at that time 
changes to the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and the forfeiture rate  as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize 
in  and  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the compensation expense includes contingent consideration potentially issuable to the blammo employees  which is recorded as research and development expense over the term of the earn out periods  as these employees are primarily employed in product development 
we will re measure the fair value of the contingent consideration each reporting period and will only record a compensation expense for the portion of the earn out target which is likely to be achieved 
the total fair value of this liability has been estimated at million  of which  of stock based compensation expense has been recorded during the year ended december  in future periods  stock based compensation expense may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  asc requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated by management  we may be required to record adjustments to stock based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax benefit provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current income tax benefit provision together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  we would need to make an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset  which would increase income in the period that determination was made 
we account for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with asc  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

table of contents results of operations the following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in our statements of operations for the comparison periods identified 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands feature phone smartphone revenues our revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  due to a million increase in smartphone revenues resulting from increased sales growth on apple s ios based devices and android devices related primarily to micro transactions  offers and advertisements 
this was partially offset by a million decline in feature phone revenues primarily due to the continued migration of users from feature phones to smartphones and our shift in our product development focus towards developing new titles for smartphone devices

in approximately of our total revenues were generated by our gun bros title  while no individual title accounted for or more of our total revenues in international revenues defined as revenues generated from carriers and other distributors whose principal operations are located outside the united states decreased by million  from million in to million in this was primarily related to a million decrease in our americas  excluding the united states  revenues  primarily related to declining feature phone revenues 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in our emea revenues  primarily related to increased revenues from certain oem relationships and smartphone revenue growth on apple and android digital storefronts  partially offset by continued declines in our carrier based business 
our smartphone revenues exceeded our feature phone revenues in each of the second  third and fourth quarters of and we believe that our smartphone revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues during each quarter of we have experienced significant growth with respect to the revenues that we derive from micro transactions in our freemium games  and expect to experience additional growth during cost of revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of revenues royalties and other cost of revenues impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues revenues gross margin

this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in hosting fees to support our freemium titles and a million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the additional intangible assets we acquired as part of both the griptonite and blammo acquisitions 
revenues attributable to games based upon branded intellectual property decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in  primarily due to our focus on developing freemium games for smartphones and tablets that are based on our own intellectual property 
revenues attributable to games based upon original intellectual property were of our total revenues for  and we expect that this percentage will continue to significantly increase in the average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed intellectual property  excluding royalty impairments  decreased from in to in due to decreased sales of titles with higher royalty rates 
overall royalties  including impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees  as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in we expect that our gross margin will increase in from the gross margin we recognized in due primarily to our expectation that we will continue to generate an increasing percentage of our total revenues from games based upon original intellectual property 
however  we expect our overall cost of revenues to remain relatively flat due to an expected increase in our total revenues and an expected increase in our hosting costs related to our freemium games 
research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage of revenues our research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to a million increase in salaries  benefits and variable compensation under our employee bonus plans as we increased our research and development headcount from employees in to employees in  mainly resulting from the acquisitions of the griptonite and blammo studios in the third quarter of the increase was also due to a million increase in outside service fees associated with the development of new freemium smartphone games by external developers as part of our glu partners program  a  increase in stock based compensation expense  which includes a  charge associated with the contingent consideration issued to employees of blammo who had been shareholders of blammo and a  increase in travel and entertainment associated with additional travel related to the integration of the griptonite acquisition and travel from our regional offices to our us headquarters as part of our glu university initiative 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased from in to in research and development expenses included million of stock based compensation expense in and  in we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase during  primarily due to the increased headcount from the griptonite and blammo acquisitions being included for the full fiscal year and our expected release of more than new freemium games for smartphones during sales and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percentage of revenues 
table of contents our sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in marketing promotions associated with the launch of our social  freemium game titles 
this amount was partially offset by a  decrease in salaries  benefits  variable compensation and expatriate costs as we reduced our sales and marketing headcount from in to in  which was the result of headcount reductions in our emea region and lower cost locations 
we also had a  decrease in allocated facility and overhead costs  resulting from lower sales and marketing headcount 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in sales and marketing expenses included  of stock based compensation expense in and  in we expect our sales and marketing expenditures to continue to increase in in connection with the sales and marketing initiatives we intend to undertake related to our expected release of more than new freemium games for smartphones during general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses percentage of revenues our general and administrative expenses increased  or  from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in professional  consulting and outside service fees associated primarily with the external legal  audit and valuation services performed as part of the griptonite and blammo acquisitions and a  increase in stock based compensation expense 
we also had a  increase in salaries  benefits and variable compensation due primarily to a  increase in variable compensation under our employee bonus plans 
however  salaries and benefit costs decreased in compared to despite headcount increasing from in to in this is due to the fact that costs attributable to the additional headcount that we added in the third and fourth quarters of did not fully offset lower salary costs from the first six months of the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in allocated facility and overhead costs due to increased research and development headcount in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in general and administrative expenses included million of stock based compensation expense in and  in we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase slightly during in addition  we may also be exposed to continued fluctuations in the fair market value of the contingent consideration issued to the blammo non employee shareholders  as the fair value of the contingent consideration will be measured during each reporting period until the end of the earn out period in march other operating expenses our restructuring charge decreased from million in to  in our restructuring charges for were comprised of  related to employee termination costs in our united states  china  brazil  italy and united kingdom offices and  related primarily to facility related charges associated with vacating a portion of our moscow office

we expect our net interest expense to decrease in future periods due to having fully repaid the mig notes at the end of and due to the expiration of our credit facility at june  income tax provision our income tax provision decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to a partial release of our valuation allowance  pursuant to asc  as a result of the acquisition of griptonite 
this decrease was partially offset by higher taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  changes in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes resulting from increased sales in countries with withholding tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to the effect of our non us operations  non deductible stock based compensation expense  an increase in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate in was mainly attributable to higher pre tax income in our uk entity  changes in withholding taxes and non deductible stock based compensation 
these changes were partially offset by a release of our valuation allowance associated with the acquisition of griptonite 
our effective income tax rates for and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as changes in our business such as intercompany transactions  any acquisitions  any changes in our international structure  any changes in the geographic location of our business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of our income  any changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities  changes in applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
at december   we anticipated that the liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately  within the next twelve months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation in foreign jurisdictions in which we do business

a significant portion of these agreements require us to pay guaranteed royalties over the term of the contracts regardless of actual game sales 
we have contracts with various third party developers to design and develop games as part of our glu partners initiative 
these contracts require us to advance funds to these third party developers  in installments  payable upon the completion of specified development milestones 
as of december   unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties were classified within other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement of our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next months

the fair value represents the present value of probability adjusted revenues related to the blammo earnout for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as of december   we had recorded  on our condensed consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term liabilities as employee shareholders of blammo must continue to provide services during the earnout periods 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k  that are not already disclosed in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu  which clarifies the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
asu specifies if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
in addition  this asu expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under asc to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted asu as of january  and its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  asu 
asu changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and ifrs 
asu also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for reporting periods beginning on or after december  we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
asu requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this new guidance is to be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
we are potentially exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest earned on our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no short term investments and substantially all million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating bank accounts earning nominal interest 
accordingly  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity related to these amounts 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states  the united kingdom  brazil  canada  china  france  hong kong  italy  russia and spain and our current deposits are likely in excess of insured limits 
our accounts receivable primarily relate to revenues earned from domestic and international wireless carriers and digital storefronts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our carriers financial condition but generally require no collateral from them 
at december   apple accounted for  tapjoy accounted for  telecomunicaciones movilnet accounted for and google accounted for of total accounts 
table of contents receivable 
at december   verizon wireless accounted for and telecomunicaciones movilnet accounted for of total accounts receivable 
no other customer represented more than of our total accounts receivable as of these dates 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and in and  some of these currencies fluctuated by up to 
our revenues are usually denominated in the functional currency of the carrier or distributor while the operating expenses of our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency  with the significant operating currencies consisting of british pound sterling gbp  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble 
although recording operating expenses in the local currency of our foreign operations mitigates some of the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations  variances among the currencies of our customers and our foreign operations relative to the united states dollar usd could have and have had a material impact on our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations in gbp versus the usd and in the euro versus gbp 
at month end  foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income expense  net 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future expect to experience  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  in which our chinese operations principally transact business  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit our ability to react to foreign currency devaluations 
to date  we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities  and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
