in  we executed on our strategic initiatives while at the same time keeping a disciplined focus on our expenses 
in the first half of  our business continued to benefit from strong momentum in it spending resulting from the initial post recession refresh cycle  while in the second half of  we saw certain large enterprise clients reduce their it spending 
during the fourth quarter of  we began seeing the effects of changes to our largest software partner s channel incentive programs on our software sales  began selling hardware in the netherlands and germany  expanding our hardware footprint  and acquired ensynch in the us to expand our services business 
solid sales performance combined with operating leverage from controlling our selling and administrative expense resulted in double digit growth in earnings from operations and operating margin expansion on a consolidated basis 
while the market for it products moderated somewhat in the second half of the year from the double digit sales growth we experienced in the previous five consecutive quarters coming out of the recession  our sales performance and disciplined cost management drove financial performance ahead of our expectations 
on a consolidated basis  for the year ended december   our net sales and resulting gross profit both increased by  while gross margin held steady at

we ended the year with million of cash and cash equivalents and million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
details about segment results of operations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements sales recognition sales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our usual sales terms are fob shipping point or equivalent  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client 
however  because we either i have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or ii have specifically stated fob destination contractual terms with the client  delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market  and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service 
on selected products  and for selected client service reasons  we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product 
we generally offer a limited to day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products  which are consistent with manufacturers terms  however  for some products we may charge restocking fees 
products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair  replacement or credit to us 
we resell most unopened products returned to us 
products that cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing but are in working condition are sold to inventory liquidators  to end users as previously sold or used products  or through other channels to reduce our losses from returned products 
we record the freight we bill to our clients as net sales and the related freight costs we pay as costs of goods sold 
we report sales net of any sales based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with sales transactions 
revenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license  but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met ie  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
the sale of hardware and software products may also include the provision of services and the associated contracts contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery  when title passes to the client  for the hardware sale 
net sales of services that are performed at client locations are often service only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed 
if the services are performed at a client location in conjunction with a hardware  software or other services sale  we recognize net sales for each portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to the items as they are delivered or the services are performed 
at the inception of the arrangement  the total consideration for the arrangement is allocated to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
we determine our best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the revenue allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the products 
we currently do not have any material instances in which we account for revenue from multiple element arrangements when vendor specific evidence does not exist 
if vendor specific objective evidence were not available  we would utilize third party evidence to allocate the selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence were available  estimated selling price would be used for allocation purposes 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and  thus  are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
we determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker 
under gross sales recognition  the entire selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales  resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction  and there are no costs of goods sold 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales of services under which the time period over which the service will be provided is known  but for which there is no discernable pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service  are accounted for as subscriptions  with billings recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period 
revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for as subscriptions 
additionally  we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis 
revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
partner funding we receive payments and credits from partners  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold 
partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the inventory is sold 
changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
we primarily issue service based and performance based restricted stock units rsus 
the number of rsus ultimately awarded under performance based rsus varies based on whether we achieve certain financial results 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
for any stock options awarded  modifications to previous awards or awards of rsus that are tied to specified market conditions  we use option pricing models or lattice binomial models to determine fair value of the awards 
the estimated fair value of stock options is determined on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on evaluation of the aging of the receivables  historical write offs and the current economic environment 
should our clients or vendors circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment  our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares that value to the carrying value 
such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations 
any adverse change in these factors  among others  could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
when two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics  the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if the segment comprises only a single component 
insight has three reporting units  which are equivalent to our operating segments 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value  including goodwill 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit  including the market and income approaches 
all of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment  or both 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the company  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
in step two of the analysis  we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets  such as trademarks 
management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
see further information on the carrying value of goodwill in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued severance and restructuring activities we have taken  and may continue to take  severance and restructuring actions which require us to utilize significant estimates of costs relating to employee termination benefits and costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expenses in subsequent periods would be necessary 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
any change in a valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions established in purchase accounting will likely be a benefit to  or charge against  earnings 
we establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters 
these liabilities are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time 
if material adjustments are warranted  it could affect our effective tax rate 
additional information about the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual 
an accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
additional information about contingencies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

in addition  we incurred a non cash charge of approximately million during the year when we wrote off certain computer software development costs that will not be placed into service as a result of the north america it systems integration project 
salaries and benefits increased million due to investments in headcount  and variable sales incentive compensation increased million on increased gross profit in the year ended december  additionally  legal and professional fees increased million due primarily to higher fees associated with responding to the subpoena received by our calence subsidiary for documents and information related to its participation in the e rate program 
for a discussion of legal proceedings  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the year over year comparison was also affected by the prior year s selling and administrative expenses being reduced by million upon the collection of a single account receivable which we had previously specifically reserved as doubtful

emea s selling and administrative expenses increased  or million in us dollars  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  selling and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year 
the year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits due to investments in headcount and related benefits and increases in variable sales incentive compensation on increased gross profit 
additionally  we incurred incremental selling and administrative expenses associated with investments in our it systems in emea during the year

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued non operating income expense 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to increases in average cash balances outstanding 
interest expense 
interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and capital lease obligation and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility 
interest expense declined for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to lower average borrowing rates year to year and a change in estimate in the prior year described below 
imputed interest under our inventory financing facility was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to decreased weighted average interest rates  partially offset by higher average balances outstanding under the facility 
during the year ended december   we reduced interest expense by  for a change in estimate of accrued interest related to two state unclaimed property settlements 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including gains losses on foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change in net foreign currency exchange gains losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates  as mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain non functional currency assets and liabilities against changes in exchange rate movements 
the change from a net foreign currency exchange loss in the prior year to a gain in the current year was driven by our emea segment

other expense  net  consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the reorganization of certain of our foreign operations during the fourth quarter that resulted in the recognition of foreign tax credits

interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the increase in interest income year over year is primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances in interest expense

after giving effect to these items  the remaining decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to decreases in the weighted average borrowings outstanding as we have used excess cash to pay down debt 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including the period end remeasurement of intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change from a net foreign currency exchange gain in the prior year to a loss in the current year is due primarily to more volatility in the applicable exchange rates  particularly in our apac segment

the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold  respectively  in compared to the prior year 
the decreases in other current assets and deferred revenue in were primarily due to a large project for which we deferred revenue recognition and the related costs as of december  until we received client acceptance of the work performed during the increase in other assets in was primarily due to an increase in multi year contracts resulting in increased long term accounts receivable and deferred costs compared to the prior year

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our cash conversion cycle was days in the fourth quarter ended december   up four days from the fourth quarter of due to increases in dso period to period  primarily in our foreign operations  and due to a higher mix of transactions booked late in the fourth quarter 
our cash conversion cycle was days in the fourth quarter ended december   decreasing five days from days in the fourth quarter ended december  these results were primarily due to the expanded use of our inventory financing facility  which contributed to an increase in dpos during the fourth quarter of of six days  partially offset by an increase in days inventory outstanding resulting from increased investment in inventory to support specific client engagements 
we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts

our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives 
our consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our senior revolving credit facility and our abs facility is limited by certain financial covenants  particularly a maximum leverage ratio 
the maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the company s trailing month net earnings plus i interest expense  excluding non cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility  ii income tax expense  iii depreciation and amortization and iv non cash stock based compensation referred to herein as adjusted earnings 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the agreements is times as of december  a significant drop in the company s adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter  to a level that could be below the company s consolidated maximum debt capacity 
as of december   the company s total debt balance that could have been outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility and our abs facility was equal to the maximum available under the facilities of million

acquisitions our strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add select services capabilities 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or some combination of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients
