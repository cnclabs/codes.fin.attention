item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and all other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  projections  and words of similar meaning  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time  we may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements under outlook for fiscal  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
our business faces many risks  and set forth below are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 

table of contents weakness in the united states us and international economies may harm our business 
our revenue levels are generally dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which includes worldwide expenditures for electronic design automation eda software  hardware  and consulting services 
periods of economic uncertainty  such as the recession experienced in and much of  can adversely affect our customers and postpone decisions to license or purchase our products  decrease our customers spending  and jeopardize or delay our customers ability or willingness to make payment obligations  any of which could adversely affect our business 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate 
our revenues  particularly new software license revenues  are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale  and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment 
a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount  or cancelled 
the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter attempting to obtain more favorable terms 
this may result in failure to agree to terms within the fiscal quarter and cause expected revenue to slip into a subsequent quarter 
our business could be impacted by fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns  the timing of significant orders  and the mix of licenses and products purchased by our customers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control  including customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
we typically experience seasonality in demand for our products  due to the purchasing cycles of our customers  with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest 
if planned contract renewals are delayed or the average size of renewed contracts do not increase as we anticipate  we could fail to meet our and investors expectations  which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our revenues are also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where we recognize software revenues as payments become due and payable  on a cash basis  or ratably over the license term as compared to revenues recognized at the beginning of the license term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the license term  for instance  when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable  due and payable  and or cash based revenue recognition could result in increased deferral of software revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues  which could result in us not meeting near term revenue expectations 
the gross margin on our software is greater than that for our emulation hardware systems  software support  and professional services 
as a result  our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
we also have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relatively large negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected  our gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
we face intense price competition in the eda industry 
price competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share  and additional working capital requirements 
if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products  we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully 
any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results 
any broad based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle certain software products at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could significantly reduce demand for our products or limit prices we can charge 
we currently compete primarily with two large companies synopsys  inc and cadence design systems  inc we also compete with smaller companies and compete with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed their own eda products internally 

table of contents foreign currency fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we typically generate about half of our revenues from customers outside the us and we generate approximately one third of our expenses outside the us while most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  our international operating expenses are typically denominated in foreign currencies 
significant changes in currency exchange rates  particularly in the japanese yen  euro  and the british pound  could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
our international operations subject us to risks in addition to those we face in our domestic operations  including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  local labor laws  import or export licensing requirements  anti corruption and other similar laws  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings  and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
if we violate applicable laws related to our business  we could be subject to penalties  fines  or other sanctions and could be prohibited or limited from doing business in one or more countries 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit ic and electronics systems industries 
purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the ic and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the increasing complexity of ics and resulting increase in costs to design and manufacture ics have in recent years led to fewer design starts  which could cause a reduced demand for our products 
in addition  the ic and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles within such companies or decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns could cause diminished demand for our products and services 
customer payment defaults could adversely affect our timing of revenue recognition 
we use fixed term license agreements as standard business practices with customers we believe are creditworthy 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements have payments spread over the license term and are typically about three years in length for semiconductor companies and about four years in length for military and aerospace companies 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  and disputes 
if we are unable to collect under these agreements  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we use these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products  or services 
if we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on the terms of the agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized under us generally accepted accounting principles as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change could have a material adverse impact on our near term results 
ic and printed circuit board pcb technology evolves rapidly 
the complexity of ics and pcbs continues to rapidly increase 
in response to this increasing complexity  new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive 
if we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments  our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive  which could materially adversely impact our business 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software  or the products or systems designed with or manufactured using tools that may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased support or service costs 

table of contents in addition  we include limited amounts of third party technology in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us 
failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business 
long sales cycles and delay in customer completion of projects make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict 
we have a lengthy sales cycle 
a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
sales of our products and services are sometimes discretionary and may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles  or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
long sales cycles for our hardware products may subject us to risks over which we have limited control  including insufficient  excess  or obsolete inventory  variations in inventory valuation  and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
any loss of our leadership position in certain categories of the eda market could harm our business 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific categories of the eda market 
for example  one company may have a large percentage of sales in the physical verification category of the market while another may have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from categories in which we are the leader 
conversely  it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in categories where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason we lose our leadership position in a category  the loss could materially adversely impact our business 
accounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and may change 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition are complex and have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software revenues at the beginning of the license period 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from relatively few product groups 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of relatively few product groups and related support services 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycles  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  and economic and market conditions  could harm our operating results 
we may experience difficulty in manufacturing our emulation hardware 
we currently contract with a single manufacturer to assemble our hardware emulation products and purchase some components from a single supplier 
as a result  we may be exposed to delays in production and delivery of our emulation products due to delays in receiving components or manufacturing constraints  low yields of ics or printed circuit boards  or other delays in the manufacturing process 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
also  our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
the tax authorities in the us and other countries where we do business regularly examine our income and other tax returns 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 

table of contents forecasting our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
the computation of income tax expense benefit is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under us generally accepted accounting principles 
income tax expense benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our us and us effective tax rates for the year  which includes forward looking financial projections  including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction  and contains numerous assumptions 
various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur 
our income tax rate can be materially impacted  for example  by the geographical mix of our profits and losses  changes in our business  such as internal restructuring and acquisitions  changes in tax laws and accounting guidance  and other regulatory  legislative or judicial developments  tax audit determinations  changes in our uncertain tax positions  changes in our intent and capacity to permanently reinvest foreign earnings  changes to our transfer pricing practices  tax deductions attributed to equity compensation  and changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
for these reasons  our overall global tax rate may be materially different than our forecast 
there are limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 
we may not realize revenues as a result of our investments in research and development 
we incur substantial expense to develop new software products 
research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time 
these efforts may not result in a successful product offering because of changes in market conditions or our failure to successfully develop products based on that research and development activity 
as a result  we could realize little or no revenues related to our investment in research and development 
we may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them 
the industry in which we compete has experienced significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  we have acquired numerous businesses and have frequently been in discussions with potential acquisition candidates  and we may acquire other businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure that any completed transaction will result in long term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could materially adversely impact us difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and increases in revenues  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering  and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  unanticipated liabilities or litigation in connection with or as a result of an acquisition  including claims from terminated employees  customers  or third parties  adverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product 
table of contents offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls  and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings  and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors could impair our ability to forecast  meet revenues and earnings targets  and manage effectively our business for long term growth 
we cannot assure that we can effectively meet these challenges 
we may not adequately protect our proprietary rights or we may fail to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses  and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate  or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
we cannot predict if any of these patents will cover any of our products 
in addition  many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications  or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the us some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 
our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and may subject us to unanticipated obligations 
the products  services or technologies we acquire  license  provide or develop may incorporate or use open source software 
we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid unintended consequences  such as reciprocal license grants  patent retaliation clauses  and the requirement to license our products at no cost 
nevertheless  we may be subject to unanticipated obligations regarding our products which incorporate open source software 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff  and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical  and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
we have global sales and research and development offices in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the us we have global sales and research and development offices  some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the us in particular  our offices in egypt and pakistan may be subject to disruption or closure from time to time 
as a result  we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of potential unrest  terrorist acts  or military conflicts than businesses located domestically 
if our it security measures are breached  our information systems may be perceived as being insecure  which could harm our business and reputation 
our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information owned by us and our customers 
we have sales and research and development offices throughout the world 
our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached due to employee errors or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations 
breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  adverse publicity and litigation 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 
in addition  if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings  despite our attempts to validate the security of such services  proprietary information may be 
table of contents misappropriated by third parties 
if there is an actual or perceived breach of our security  or the security of one of our vendors  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business  or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers 
oregon law and our shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
the oregon business combination act limits the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
this provision may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
in december  we extended the term of our shareholder rights plan  which has the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
the provisions of the oregon business combination act and our shareholder rights plan could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of us  could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
our revolving credit facility has financial and non financial covenants  and default of any covenant could materially adversely impact us 
our bank revolving credit facility imposes operating restrictions on us in the form of financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants include adjusted quick ratio  tangible net worth  leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio  and minimum cash and accounts receivable ratio 
if we were to fail to comply with the financial covenants and did not obtain a waiver from our lenders  we would be in default under the revolving credit facility and our lenders could terminate the facility and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility 
the declaration of an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we could also find it difficult to obtain other bank lines or credit facilities on comparable terms 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of january   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of convertible subordinated debentures due  million in other notes payable  and million in short term borrowings 
this level of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
we may also be unable to borrow funds as a result of an inability of financial institutions to lend due to restrictive lending policies and or institutional liquidity concerns 
if we experience a decline in revenues  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our stock price could become more volatile  and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this risk factors section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements  or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings  and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders 
responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees 
the perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners

we believe that we will be able to renew or replace our existing leases as they expire and that our current facilities will be adequate through at least the year ending january  item legal proceedings from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits relating to intellectual property rights  contracts  distributorships  and employee relations matters 
periodically  we review the status of various disputes and litigation matters and assess our potential exposure 
when we consider the potential loss from any dispute or legal matter probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated  we will accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties  and the outcomes are difficult to predict 
because of such uncertainties  we base accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 
we believe that the outcome of current litigation  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on our results of operations 
in some instances we are unable to reasonably estimate any potential loss or range of loss 
the nature and progression of litigation can make it difficult to predict the impact a particular lawsuit will have 
there are many reasons that we cannot make these assessments  including  among others  one or more of the following the early stages of a proceeding  damages sought that are unspecific  unsupportable  unexplained or uncertain  discovery not having been started or incomplete  the complexity of the facts that are in dispute  the difficulty of assessing novel claims  the parties not having engaged in any meaningful settlement discussions  the possibility that other parties may share in any ultimate liability  and or the often slow pace of litigation
