item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
please note that the company effected a for stock split on january   and all historical common stock and per share information has been changed to reflect the stock split 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases 
we use our proprietary technology to create novel small molecule drug conjugates  or smdcs  and companion imaging diagnostics 
our smdcs actively target receptors that are over expressed on diseased cells  relative to healthy cells 
this targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with highly active drugs at greater doses  delivered more frequently  and over longer periods of time than would be possible with the untargeted drug alone 
we are also developing companion imaging diagnostics for each of our smdcs that are designed to identify the patients whose disease over expresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore more likely to benefit from treatment 
this combination of an smdc with its companion imaging diagnostic is designed to personalize the treatment of patients by delivering effective therapy  selectively to diseased cells  in the patients most likely to benefit 
our lead smdc candidate  ec  targets the folate receptor  which is frequently over expressed on cancer cells 
we have chosen platinum resistant ovarian cancer  or proc  a highly treatment resistant disease  as our lead indication for development of ec because of the high unmet need in treating this patient population and the high percentage of ovarian cancer patients whose tumors over express the targeted folate receptor 
we conducted a multicenter  open label randomized phase clinical trial of ec in women with proc  referred to as the precedent trial 
based upon our findings from the precedent trial  we initiated enrollment of our proceed trial  a phase registration trial in women with proc  in the first half of but enrollment stopped later in the year due to global shortages of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin  or pld marketed in the us under the brand name doxil 
in march  we announced that the us food and drug administration  or fda approved our plans to import our supply of pld from europe into the us so that we can resume proceed enrollment in the us in  we will be increasing the amount of time and resources  both financial and personnel  devoted to our ec program in proc 
we are currently preparing to file marketing authorization applications to the european medicines agency  or ema  for ec for the treatment of proc and for ec for patient selection in the third quarter of these filings will be based on the results and supplemental analyses of our precedent trial 
our filings will be supported by four clinical studies a phase study in solid tumors  two single agent  single arm phase studies in ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer nsclc  and the precedent trial  a randomized study in proc 
the results of the precedent trial demonstrated a statistically significant delay in disease progression or death in the overall population  with the largest improvement observed in the fr patient population  those with all tumors positive for the folate receptor 
women with fr platinum resistant ovarian cancer who received ec based therapy experienced a percent decrease in their risk of progression 
hr  p 
compared to women receiving chemotherapy alone 
median progression free survival pfs  the time without disease progressing in the ec based treatment arm was months compared to months of women who received chemotherapy alone 
tumor shrinkage overall response rate was observed in percent of women receiving the ec based therapy compared to percent in patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
in addition to proc  we are pursuing clinical trials of ec in other indications and we also plan to advance other smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics through development as preclinical and clinical trial results merit and funding permits 
we plan to begin enrollment in a randomized phase trial of ec and ec for the treatment of second line nsclc in the second quarter of on february   we sold  shares of common stock  including  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters in our initial public offering 
proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other transaction costs  were approximately million 
upon the completion of the offering  all of our outstanding subordinated convertible promissory notes  or subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon were automatically converted into  shares of common stock using a conversion price of per share of the original issue price of the shares sold in the initial public offering  all of our outstanding preferred stock was converted into an aggregate  shares of common stock  and all of the outstanding warrants to purchase our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock 
on august   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering  including  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment 
proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other transaction costs  were approximately million 
financial operations overview we have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a retained deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the advancement of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics through the research  development  regulatory and commercialization processes 
we expect that our current cash position  including cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to fund our operations through the end of the first quarter of our current operating plan includes completion of proceed  the phase clinical trial of ec and ec  through the availability of final primary pfs data from that study which is anticipated to be in the first half of  assuming the availability of pld  the preparation of applications to the ema for conditional marketing authorization for ec and ec  pre commercial activities in europe  a randomized phase trial of ec and ec for the treatment of second line nsclc and to advance our earlier stage phase and preclinical pipeline 
if we were to receive conditional marketing approval in europe of ec and ec prior to the completion of the proceed study  this could impact the enrollment timeline as european sites would transition from clinical trials to commercial use 
this could delay the availability of final data from the proceed trial 
we may be able to mitigate this potential delay by adding clinical trial sites in locations where conditional marketing approval has not been granted 
if the fda requires us to undertake a second phase clinical trial or obtain final os data from proceed or we initiate significant investments in commercial capabilities  we will require additional financing through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources  such as strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements  to fund the additional activities 
such funding may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the proceed trial was initiated in may but enrollment stopped later in the year due to global shortages of doxil 
we have purchased a sufficient quantity of doxil and have received approvel from the fda to import the drug into the us for use in the proceed trial 
we have plans to resume enrollment in the us if the supplies of doxil remain limited for an extended period of time  our proceed trial may be significantly delayed 
revenue to date  we have generated no revenue from sales of our smdcs or companion imaging diagnostics 
all of our revenue has been derived from license fees  milestone payments and government grants 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of direct sales of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  license fees  milestone payments and royalties in connection with strategic collaborations 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  achievement of performance based milestones and other payments received under such collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
based upon our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics currently in development and the stage of development  we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until at the earliest 
if we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  including employee related expenses  which include salaries and stock based compensation expense  expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a portion of our preclinical studies  the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials  license fees for and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology  costs associated with non clinical activities and regulatory approvals  and research supplies 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
license fees and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology and research supplies are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use 
conducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model 
our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of late stage clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future due to the proceed trial and the phase trial for second line nsclc for our most advanced smdc  ec  and to further advance our earlier stage research and development projects 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are advancing our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in parallel for multiple therapeutic indications and through our preclinical development programs we are seeking to develop potential smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics for additional disease indications 
the following table sets forth costs incurred on a program specific basis for identified lead candidate smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  excluding personnel related costs 
discovery research includes such costs for projects where no lead candidate has yet been identified 
all employee related expenses for those employees working in research and development functions are included in research and development payroll 
year ended december  ec ec ec ec ec discovery research research and development payroll total research and development expenses the following table identifies the current status of our major research and development projects and our currently expected near term milestone timing project status expected near term milestones ec phase initiating re start of phase trial ec phase initiating re start of phase trial ec phase completed phase trial in ec phase evaluating future development options ec phase evaluating future development options general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and stock based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include employee benefits  facility  patent filing and prosecution costs  and professional service fees 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future primarily for the following reasons increased payroll and expanded infrastructure as a result of more advanced development activity and potential preparation for commercial operations  increased expenses related to becoming a public company  including increased legal  accounting and investor relations fees  higher director compensation and increased insurance premiums  and expenses related to the sales and marketing of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in anticipation of commercial launch before we receive regulatory approval 
other income other income consists primarily of gains or losses on sales of equipment  amounts related to the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and income for a tax credit award 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation 
interest expense consists primarily of interest  amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our previous credit facility with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  and oxford finance corporation  or oxford and our current facility with mid cap financial  or mid cap and silicon valley bank  or svb 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements and have been reviewed and discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition to date  our revenues have been generated primarily through collaborative research  development and commercialization agreements 
the terms of these collaborative agreements typically include payments to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  upfront license fees  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
this evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
we typically have received upfront  nonrefundable payments when licensing our intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement 
upfront payments  if they are nonrefundable and not contingent on further performance by us  are recognized when due pursuant to the terms of the underlying contract or when cash is received  if collectability is uncertain 
our licensing agreements may also contain milestone payments 
revenues from milestones are recognized upon the achievement of the milestone event if the event is substantive  objectively determinable and represents an important point in the development life cycle of the smdc 
if not considered substantive  milestones are initially deferred and recognized over the remaining performance obligation 
we have not received any royalty revenues related to smdc or companion imaging diagnostic sales to date 
grant revenue is recognized when earned  which is in the period in which qualifying expenditures are incurred 
accrued clinical expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts  identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
expense accruals related to clinical trial activity typically comprise the majority of these accruals 
examples of estimated expenses related to clinical trial activity include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under certain contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services are performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of the effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual accordingly 
although our estimates in the past have not been materially different from amounts actually incurred  and we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred in the future  if our estimate of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period 
based on our level of clinical trial expenses for the twelve months ended december   a five percent change in our estimate could result in an adjustment to our accrued clinical trial expense in future periods of approximately  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  compensation stock compensation  which we refer to as asc  using the prospective transition method 
generally  options fully vest over four years from the grant date and have a term of ten years 
options granted in connection with an employee s commencement of employment generally vest over a four year period with half of the shares subject to the grant vesting after two years of employment and remaining options vesting monthly over the remainder of the four year period 
options granted for performance or promotions vest monthly over a four year period 
unexercised stock options terminate on the tenth anniversary date after the date of grant 
the company recognizes the stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantees  which generally equals the vesting period 
in connection with the adoption of asc  the company reassessed the valuation methodology for stock options and the related input assumptions 
as a result  beginning with the stock option grant  the company utilizes a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options 
the black scholes model allows the use of a range of assumptions related to volatility  risk free interest rate  and employee exercise behavior 
prior to the initial public offering  the expected volatility was derived from the historical volatility of the nasdaq biotechnology index  which the company determined was a proxy for its volatility 
since the company has elected to use an index to determine the value of its stock options  it is applying the calculated value approach for a private company instead of using fair value 
since august  all grants have been valued under the fair value provisions of asc since the company completed its initial public offering in february  it does not have sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate volatility 
as a result  the company has used an average of several peer companies volatilities to determine a reasonable estimate of volatility 
for purposes of identifying similar entities  the company considered characteristics such as industry  length of trading history  market capitalization and similar product pipelines 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the weighted average yield of a treasury security with the same term as the expected life of the options and the dividend yield is based on historical experience and the company s estimate of future dividend yields 
prior to february  the expected life of the options was based on the weighted average life of the company s historical option grants  and the dividend yield is based on historical experience and the company s estimate of future dividend yields 
subsequent to february the initial public offering  due to the lack of available quarterly data for the peer companies and insufficient history as a public company  the company elected to use the simplified method for plain vanilla options to estimate the expected term of the stock options grants 
under this approach  the weighted average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
the value of our stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following assumptions year ended december  volatility expected term in years risk free interest rates dividend yield in accordance with asc  we recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately   and  for the year ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had million in total unrecognized compensation expense  net of related forfeiture estimates  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in may  the company adopted and granted awards under a new performance based restricted stock unit rsu program the rsu program under the company s equity incentive plan 
each unit represents an amount equal to one share of the company s common stock 
the rsus will be earned  in whole or in part  based on performance and service conditions 
the performance condition is based upon whether the company receives regulatory approval to sell a therapeutic product  and the awards include a target number of rsus that will vest upon a first commercial approval  and a maximum number of rsus that will vest upon a second commercial approval 
the rsus will vest fifty percent based on the performance condition of commercial approval and fifty percent one year thereafter to fulfill the service condition  which requires the employee to remain employed by the company 
as of december   the company has  rsus outstanding 
the unrecorded stock compensation expense is based on number of units granted  less estimated forfeitures based on the company s historical forfeiture rate of  and the closing market price of the company s common stock at the grant date 
as of december   the performance condition of obtaining regulatory approval has not been achieved  therefore  no vesting has occurred 
the awards are being accounted for under asc  and compensation expense is to be recorded if the company has determined that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved 
as of december   it was not probable that the performance conditions will be achieved  therefore  no compensation expense was recorded for the year ended december  unrecorded compensation expense for the rsu program as of december  was million 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands statement of operations data revenue operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net net loss revenue for the year ended december   we earned revenue from a licensing agreement with on target laboratories  llc  or on target  which was entered into in september under such license agreement  we granted on target exclusive worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize products relating to the compound comprising endocyte s folate and dupa ligands and other certain licensed patents 
on target is solely responsible for conducting research and development  seeking regulatory approval and commercialization of products 
the company received nonrefundable upfront license fees totaling  from on target in december and the amount was recognized as collaboration revenue in the same period 
on target is considered a related party as the company was founded by a relative of the company s chief scientific officer 
the company believes that the terms of the agreement are no less favorable than terms available in an arm s length transaction 
research and development the increase in research and development expense in compared to was attributable to a million increase in clinical trial and product expenses principally due to the proceed trial  and a million increase in manufacturing and regulatory expenses related to the anticipated regulatory filing with the ema for ec and ec  including process and method validations for ec and ec the increase also included a million increase in compensation expense due to  of severance compensation charges and increased bonus accrual and stock based compensation expense in included in research and development expense were stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the compensation charge for year ended december  included a  charge relating to severance stock based compensation 
research and development expenses include expense of  and  for the years ended and  respectively  for company funded research at purdue university  the primary employer of our chief science officer 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees and insurance associated with being a public company and compensation expenses 
included in general administrative expenses were stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
interest income the increase in interest income in compared to resulted from an increase in short term investments due to the proceeds from the public stock offerings completed in interest expense the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to increased borrowings under the loan agreement with mid cap and svb and the interest payable on outstanding subordinated notes which were converted to common shares at the initial public offering 
other income  net other income decreased in compared to due to receiving an award of million under section d of the code for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects in the other expense in related primarily to charitable contributions and foreign currency losses 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands statement of operations data revenue operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other income  net net loss revenue for the year ended december   we earned revenue from a licensing agreement with bristol myers squibb  or bms  which was entered into on december  under such license agreement  we granted bms an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize smdcs using folate as the targeting ligand and epothilone as the drug payload 
in  bms advanced this folate epothilone smdc  which bms called bms  into a phase clinical trial  which triggered a million milestone payment under the license 
on june   bms notified us of their intent to terminate the license 
we believe bms elected to terminate the license as a result of a change in its strategic focus 
we received an aggregate of million from bms from the fourth quarter to the third quarter of pursuant to this license 
research and development the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in payroll expense due to a shift of management focus from research and development activities to general and administrative functions during these decreases were partially offset by increased manufacturing costs incurred as preparation for the ec phase clinical trial 
included in research and development expense were stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses include expense of  and  for the years ended and  respectively  for company funded research at purdue university  the primary employer of our chief science officer 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to increases in patent prosecution expenses associated with the growing portfolio and professional fees associated with various partnering and financing activities  including the preparation for our initial public offering 
included in general administrative expenses were stock based compensation charges of  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
interest income the decrease in interest income in compared to resulted from a decrease in balances available for investment due to the use of these funds for operations 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to the decrease in the outstanding and unpaid principal under our previous credit facility with gecc and oxford  which was repaid in august  partially offset by the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest incurred under our new credit facility 
other income  net other income increased in compared to primarily due to receiving an award of million under section d of the code for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
other income  net in also includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of  which was offset by an increase in income of  related to the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations principally through private placements of equity and debt securities  revenue from strategic collaborations  revenue from grants  loans  private equity and debt financings and  most recently  the two public offerings of common stock we completed in as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in august  we entered into a million loan agreement with mid cap and svb to pay off an existing loan that was set to mature in upon execution of the agreement  we drew million in principal 
in december  we amended the loan agreement in order to access the remaining tranche of million 
in september  we modified the loan agreement to revise the repayment terms 
as revised  we are required to make interest only monthly payments through december followed by months of interest and principal payments 
this modification will provide us with additional working capital of million over the month period of interest only payments 
on october   we were notified we had been awarded a total of million under section d of the code for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
in november  we received million of this award  and the remaining million was received in february this was accounted for as other income in in december  we issued million of subordinated notes  and as of december   the subordinated notes were treated as share settled debt under asc and were recorded at fair value 
the subordinated notes accrued interest in kind at an annual rate of percent 
in january  we issued an additional million of subordinated notes to certain accredited investors 
on february   we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering 
proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other transaction costs  were million 
upon the completion of the offering  all outstanding subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon were automatically converted into  shares of common stock using a conversion price of per share of the original issue price of the shares sold in the initial public offering  all outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into an aggregate  shares of common stock  and all outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock 
on august   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering 
proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other transaction costs  were approximately million 
currently  our primary uses of working capital are for conducting proceed  the phase clinical trial of ec and ec  preparing the applications for conditional marketing authorization from the ema for ec and ec and preparing for the randomized phase trial of ec and ec in nsclc 
the following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the use of cash in all periods primarily resulted from our net losses adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash used for the year ended compared to resulted from an increase in collaboration revenue received from bms offset by a decrease in interest income 
the increase in cash used in compared to was due to increases in clinical trial expenses  manufacturing and regulatory expenses related to the anticipated regulatory filing with the ema for ec and ec and general and administrative expenses relating to being a public company 
investing activities the cash provided by used in investing activities for each of the three years was due primarily to the net result of maturities and sales of short term investments  which was partially offset by capital expenditures for equipment of  in   in and  in financing activities the cash provided by financing activities in was from the sale and issuance of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of million  which was partially offset by principal payments of million on our prior credit facility with gecc and oxford 
for  our financing activities consisted of repaying our credit facility with gecc and oxford of million  receiving proceeds from our new credit facility with mid cap and svb of million and receiving gross proceeds of million for the issuance of subordinated notes 
the cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of the million in proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes and million in proceeds from the public offerings in february and august and  in payments from the exercise of stock options 
these receipts were partially offset by million of principal payments on the mid cap and svb loan facility 
credit facilities in august  we entered into a million credit facility with mid cap and svb to pay off a prior credit facility to fund research and development and for general corporate purposes 
we drew down million in principal amount upon signing the agreement at a fixed percent interest rate and drew down the remaining million in december repayment of the principal began in april following a seven month interest only period 
in september  we modified the loan agreement to provide for interest only monthly payments from october to december  followed by months of interest and principal payments 
this modification will provide the company with additional working capital of million over the month interest only period 
the loan is collateralized by a security interest in all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
the loan agreement includes customary covenants and may be accelerated upon the occurrence of any event of default in the loan agreement  including defects in collateral securing the loan  judgment defaults or any event or development that has a material adverse effect  as defined in the agreement 
the failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial will not  in and of itself  constitute a material adverse effect 
we are in compliance with all material covenants and other obligations in the loan agreement 
operating capital requirements if we obtain conditional marketing approval in europe  we anticipate commercializing our first product in at the earliest 
therefore  we anticipate we will continue to generate significant losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to complete our clinical trial programs for ec and ec in proc and nsclc  build commercial capabilities  develop our pipeline  initiate clinical trials of earlier stage products and expand our corporate infrastructure 
if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional opportunities to do so  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain additional credit facilities or refinance our current credit facility with mid cap and svb 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or convertible preferred stock  these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the number and characteristics of the smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics we pursue  the scope  progress  results and costs of researching and developing our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics and conducting preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  the cost of commercialization activities if any of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics are approved for sale  including marketing sales and distribution costs  the cost of manufacturing any smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics we successfully commercialize  our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships  licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales of  or royalties on  our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  if any 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  total less than year to years to years in thousands short term and long term debt including interest operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition  we have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties 
in october  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with r d biopharmaceuticals to research  develop  and commercialize products containing conjugates of folate receptor targeting compounds and tubulysin compounds 
in february  this licensing agreement was assigned by r d biopharmaceuticals to trientlgasse 
under this license agreement  we may be required to make million in additional contingent payments upon the achievement of specific scientific  clinical and regulatory milestones  in addition to royalties upon commercial sales 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with purdue research foundation relating to folate  we are obligated to pay an annual minimum royalty of  until commercial sales commence  following which time the payment of royalties with market rates will commence 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with purdue research foundation relating to psma  we are obligated to pay annual minimum payments of  until commercial sales commence  following which time the payment of royalties with market rates will commence  along with an annual milestone payment of  in addition  certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments of  along with sales based milestones related to third party sales are also payable 
we are also subject to penalties totaling  if certain diligence milestones are not met 
future milestone payments in excess of  may be waived by purdue research foundation 
there are no material obligations greater than five years 
we do not anticipate incurring liabilities for ec royalty payments based on the estimated timing of when we may have commercial sales and the expiration of the applicable patents 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission 
tax loss carryforwards as of december   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
these federal and state loss carryforwards expire at various times beginning in we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal income taxes and approximately million to offset future state income taxes 
the federal and state tax credits expire at various times through we have determined that we experienced a change in ownership as defined under section of the us internal revenue code as a result of the public offering in august as a result  the future use of our net operating losses and credit equivalents will be limited to approximately million per year 
at december  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  as we believe it is more likely than not they will not be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  an adjustment to our net operating loss carryforwards would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
the short term investments consisted of us government money market funds  us treasuries  us government agency obligations and cash equivalents 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we have the ability to hold our short investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect that our results of operations or cash flows would be adversely affected by any change in market interest rates on our investments 
we carry our investments based on publicly available information 
we do not currently have any investment securities for which a market is not readily available or active 
in addition  our loan agreement with mid cap and svb requires us to pay interest at fixed rates 
we do not believe that any credit risk is likely to have a material impact on the value of our assets and liabilities 
we contract with contract research organizations and investigational sites globally 
we may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements 
a ten percent fluctuation in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk  but as our operations in foreign countries expand  we may consider the use of hedges
