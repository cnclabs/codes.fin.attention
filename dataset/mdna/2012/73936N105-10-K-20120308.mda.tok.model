item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
our lease with suntrust is at a fixed interest rate and thus not impacted by changes in interest rates 
at december   our cash and cash equivalent balance was approximately million and we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
subsequent to december   we borrowed million on a term loan under the credit facility 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit line and a term loan  bears interest at a rate based on libor or an alternative base rate based on prevailing interest rates  in each case plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations under the credit facility 
our cash equivalents are invested in a combination of bank deposits  money market or us government mutual funds  short term time deposits  and government agency and corporate obligations  or similar kinds of instruments  the income of which generally increases or decreases in proportion to increases or decreases  respectively  in interest rates 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates have had a material impact on us in the past or are likely to have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future 
for example  a change of basis points in the interest rate on either our investments or any future reasonably likely borrowings would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
while we believe we have our cash and cash equivalents invested in relatively risk free investments  the current capital market crisis make it difficult to accurately assess the risk of each of our holdings 
this risk includes  but is not limited to  bank deposits in excess of fdic insurance limits 
commodity price risk 
from time to time we are subject to market risk from fluctuating commodity prices in certain raw materials we use in our products and from diesel fuel we use to power our generators 
to date  we have managed this risk by using alternative raw materials acceptable to our customers or we have been able to pass these cost increases to our customers 
while we do not believe that changes in commodity prices have had a material impact on us in the past  commodity price fluctuations could have a material impact on us in the future  depending on the magnitude and timing of such fluctuations 
the impact of these fluctuations could result in an increase in our operating costs and expenses and reduction in our gross margins and income due to increases in the price and costs of engines  generators  copper  aluminum  electrical components  labor  electricity  diesel fuel  gasoline  oil and natural gas 
movements in prices of these commodities can materially impact our results in this segment 
foreign exchange risk 
since substantially all of our revenues  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  if our international operations expand in the future  then our exposure to foreign currency risks could increase  which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because our efficientlights business purchases component parts manufactured in china  then to the extent the us dollar exchange rate with the chinese yuan changes significantly  our business and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange risks or other market risks  or for trading or other speculative purposes
