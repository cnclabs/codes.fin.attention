item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
critical accounting estimates note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims 
the company discloses information concerning contingent liabilities in respect of these claims and proceedings for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote and the potential loss could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we recognize liabilities for these claims and proceedings when it is probable that the company has incurred a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and to fairly present  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our consolidated financial statements  management s view of our exposure 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel as appropriate to assess probability and estimates of loss 
the company will recognize within selling  general and administrative expenses a liability related to claims and proceedings at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recognized liability will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount then the minimum amount of the range will be recognized 
the company recognizes its legal and other related professional expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses as and when the associated course of action is committed to 
we re evaluate these assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be recognized or if any existing liability should be adjusted 
the actual cost of ultimately resolving a claim or proceeding may be substantially different from the amount of the recognized liability 
in addition  because it is not permissible to recognize a liability until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to recognize a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
environmental liabilities remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our ellesmere port site in the united kingdom 
we recognize  at fair value  environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated  and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably 
table of contents estimated 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future expected costs  and has to comply with environmental legislation in the relevant countries in which it operates or has operated in 
the company views the costs of vacating our ellesmere port site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of tel  particularly in the market for aviation gasoline  there exists such uncertainty as to the probability and timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate them sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision 
pensions the company maintains a defined benefit pension plan the plan covering a number of its current and former employees in the united kingdom  although it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the us and overseas 
the plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large number of deferred and current pensioners 
a full triennial actuarial valuation of the plan was performed as at december  and an update performed as at december   the results of which are reflected in these consolidated financial statements 
movements in the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation pbo are dependent on actual return on investments as well as our assumptions in respect of the discount rate  annual member mortality rates  future return on assets  future pension increases and future inflation 
a change in any one of these assumptions could impact the plan asset value  pbo and pension charge recognized in the income statement 
such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
a change in the discount rate assumption would change the pbo by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
a change in the level of price inflation assumption would change the pbo by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
further disclosure is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax and uncertain income tax positions at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating million against part of our foreign tax credit carry forwards within deferred tax 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
objective evidence  such as operating results during the most recent periods  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
management believes there are uncertainties around whether all the foreign tax credit carry forwards can be utilized in future periods and this represents sufficient negative evidence to require a partial valuation allowance 
no deferred taxes have been provided for the unremitted earnings of our overseas subsidiaries as any tax basis differences relating to investments in these overseas subsidiaries are considered to be permanent in duration 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained  based on technical merits  when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent that we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement may require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the company s reporting units  the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment  are consistent with the reportable segments fuel specialties  active chemicals and octane additives 
all of the components in each segment including products  markets and competitors have similar economic characteristics and therefore the segments reflect the lowest level at which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the company 
the company tests goodwill annually for impairment  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
the company elected to perform its annual tests in respect of fuel specialties and active chemicals goodwill as at december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the reporting segments are estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best available estimates at that time 
the key assumptions underpinning these calculations include future revenue growth  gross margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
at december  we had million and million of goodwill relating to our fuel specialties and active chemicals segments  respectively 
at this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there had been no impairment because the estimated fair values of those reporting segments substantially exceeded the carrying values 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives segment are reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives segment is reduced 
as a result  the company determined that quarterly impairment tests be performed from january  and any impairment charge 
table of contents arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
as a result of the octane additives impairment tests performed during  and impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  have been recognized 
these charges are non cash in nature and have no impact on taxation 
in some of the assumptions and estimates underpinning the octane additives segment discounted cash flows were revised as part of our planning processes although the methodology was unchanged 
these revisions had no material impact on the reporting of goodwill 
the most significant revisions were that the company s weighted average cost of capital was changed to reflect the changing proportion of debt to equity funding of the company and effective october   the company extended its estimate for the future life of the octane additives segment from december  to december  there is million of goodwill remaining at december  which relates to the octane additives segment and equates to the fair value of the goodwill at that date 
given the quantum and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the octane additives segment the company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an approximate straight line basis to december  however  since the remaining sales of the octane additives segment are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  there is an inherent risk that they could decline with unpredictable volatility and severity resulting in an accelerated impairment of the octane additives segment goodwill as the forecast discounted cash flows from that segment would be reduced 
we believe that the assumptions used in our annual and quarterly impairment tests are reasonable  but that they are judgmental  and that variations in any of the assumptions may result in materially different calculations of impairment charges  if any 
intangible assets  net of amortization at december  we had million of intangibles that are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets relate to all of our reporting segments and are being amortized straight line over periods of up to years 
we continually assess the markets and products related to these intangibles  as well as their specific carrying values  and have concluded that these carrying values and amortization periods remain appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
if events occur or circumstances change it may cause a reduction in periods over which these intangibles are amortized or result in a non cash impairment of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in amortization periods would have no effect on cash flows

foreign income inclusions arise each year from certain types of income earned overseas being taxable under us tax regulations 
these types of income include subpart f income  principally from foreign based company sales in the united kingdom  including the associated section tax gross up  and also from the income earned by certain overseas subsidiaries taxable under the us tax regime 
in  the amount of subpart f income and the associated section gross up amounted to million million

during  an additional million of foreign tax credit carry forwards were generated  primarily due to the overseas dividend remitted to the us in the year

table of contents cash at december  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was held by non us subsidiaries principally in the united kingdom 
the company is in a position to control whether or not to repatriate foreign earnings but does not need to and does not expect to make a further repatriation in the foreseeable future and hence has not provided for future income taxes on the cash held by foreign subsidiaries although we will continue to monitor this position 
short term investments at december  and we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
debt on december   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million 
the facility carries an interest rate based on us libor plus a margin of between and which is dependant on the company s ratio of net debt to ebitda 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of liquidity defined in the finance facility 
the facility can be drawn down until it expires on december  and may be drawn down in full in the us we repaid the previous finance facility  which was due to expire on february   upon entering into the new facility 
the company s finance facility contains restrictive clauses which may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the facility obliges the lenders to comply with a request for utilization of finance unless there is an event of default outstanding 
events of default are defined in the finance facility and include a material adverse change to our assets  operations or financial condition 
the facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability  amongst other things  and subject to certain limited exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pledge our assets as security  guarantee obligations of third parties  make investments  undergo a merger or consolidation  dispose of assets  or materially change our line of business 
in addition  the facility also contains terms which  if breached  would result in it becoming repayable on demand 
it requires  among other matters  compliance with two financial covenant ratios measured on a quarterly basis 
these requirements are the ratio of net debt to ebitda shall not be greater than and the ratio of ebitda to net interest shall not be less than management has determined that the company has not breached these covenants throughout the period to december  and expects to not breach these covenants for the next months 
the finance facility is secured by a number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets which include key operating sites of the company and its subsidiaries 
as at december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its finance facility

the plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large number of deferred and current pensioners 
the company expects its annual cash contribution to be million in and million in it is not meaningful to predict an amount after five years since there are numerous uncertainties including future return on assets  pension increases and inflation 
remediation payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of current and former facilities 
it does not include any discretionary remediation costs that the company may choose to incur 
severance payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of severance costs associated with exit or disposal activities and post employment benefits 
operating lease commitments relate primarily to office space  motor vehicles and various items of computer and office equipment which are expected to be renewed and replaced in the normal course of business 
raw material purchase obligations relate to certain long term raw material contracts which have been entered into by the company that stipulate fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable cost provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk from variable interest rates on certain elements of its long term debt 
the estimated payments included in the table above reflect the variable interest charge on long term debt obligations and the effect of the interest rate swaps 
estimated commitment fees are also included and interest income is excluded 
due to the uncertainty regarding the nature of tax audits  particularly those which are not currently underway  it is not meaningful to predict the outcome of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits

table of contents financing activities on december   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million 
the facility can be drawn down until it expires on december  at december   million was drawn under the revolving credit facility 
on september   the company settled the newmarket corporation civil complaint 
the settlement agreement included the company issuing a million promissory note to newmarket corporation payable in three equal annual installments carrying simple interest at per annum  the first installment of which is due on september  environmental matters and plant closures the company is subject to environmental laws in all of the countries in which it operates 
under certain environmental laws the company is responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances or wastes at currently or formerly owned or operated properties 
most of our manufacturing operations have been conducted outside the us and  therefore  any liability pertaining to the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties is likely to be determined under non us law 
we evaluate costs for remediation  decontamination and demolition projects on a regular basis 
full provision is made for those costs to which we are committed under environmental laws 
full provision has been made for the committed costs of million at december  expenditure against provisions was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
total severance expenditure was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses floating rate debt to finance its global operations 
the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps  commodity swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with such changes 
the company offers fixed prices for some long term sales contracts 
as manufacturing and raw material costs are subject to variability the company uses commodity swaps to hedge the cost of some raw materials thus reducing volatility on earnings and cash flows 
the derivatives are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
the company s objective is to manage its exposure to fluctuating costs of raw materials 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as at december  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  no bank overdraft and long term debt of million including current portion 
long term debt comprises a new revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million and a million promissory note to newmarket corporation 
the facility carries an interest rate based on us libor plus a margin of between and which is dependant on the company s ratio of net debt to ebitda 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of liquidity defined in the finance facility 
the promissory note carries simple interest at per annum 
at december   million was drawn under the revolving credit facility 
as management does not expect the facility to be drawn down in the long term  the company has not entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this 
on the basis that interest on million of the million long term debt including current portion is fixed and that the company would receive interest on the million positive cash balances and short term investments  then the interest payable on unhedged debt 
table of contents is more than offset by the interest receivable on positive cash balances and short term investments 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates on the unhedged debt of million for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
on a net basis  assuming additional interest on the cash balances and short term investments  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity nor management action to mitigate such changes 
exchange rate risk the company generates an element of its revenues and incurs some operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency due to the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in addition  the financial position and results of operations of some of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling and swiss franc 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  to the extent that such figures reflect the inclusion of foreign assets and liabilities which are translated into us dollars for presentation in our consolidated financial statements  as well as our results of operations 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the us dollar value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments  and cash flows 
the company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company s exposure to certain foreign currency denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar value of the related foreign currency denominated revenues 
the objective of the hedging program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the trading of our fuel specialties and active chemicals reporting segments is inherently naturally hedged and accordingly changes in exchange rates would not be material to our 
table of contents earnings or financial position 
the cost base of our octane additives reporting segment and corporate costs  however  are largely denominated in british pound sterling 
a strengthening in the us dollar against british pound sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million for a one year period excluding the impact of any foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
where a strengthening of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a weakening would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income 
raw material cost risk we use a variety of raw materials  chemicals and energy in our manufacturing and blending processes 
many of the raw materials that we use are derived from petrochemical based feedstocks which can be subject to periods of rapid and significant cost instability 
these fluctuations in cost can be caused by political instability in oil producing nations and elsewhere  or other factors influencing global supply and demand of these materials  over which we have no or little control 
we use long term contracts generally with fixed costs or formula based costs to help ensure availability and continuity of supply  and to manage the risk of cost increases 
we have entered into hedging arrangements for certain raw materials  but do not typically enter into hedging arrangements for all raw materials  chemicals or energy costs 
should the costs of raw materials  chemicals or energy increase  and should we not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers  then operating margins and cash flows from operating activities would be adversely impacted 
should raw material costs increase significantly  then the company s need for working capital could similarly increase 
any of these risks could adversely impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows
