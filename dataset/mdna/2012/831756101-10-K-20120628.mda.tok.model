item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the results of swss  our security solutions division  which were previously reported as a separate business segment  are being presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for all periods presented 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discontinued operations below on page for additional information regarding these discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  any reference to income statement items in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refers to results from continuing operations 
highlights our fiscal net sales of million represented a increase of from our fiscal net sales 
firearm sales accounted for of our total net sales for fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per fully diluted share  for fiscal our operating results for fiscal were affected by numerous factors  including the following a increase in net sales resulted from higher order intake and increased production capacity to meet the large consumer demand for our polymer handguns and modern sporting rifles 
that increase also was driven by generally higher consumer demand for firearms in we have accumulated a backlog of million at april  we continue to look for opportunities to address that backlog by further increasing our production capacity through additional capital spending and outsourcing 
the introduction of new products in the last several years has had a positive impact on our business 
in particular  increased volumes for smaller sized pistols and our m p branded polymer products and modern sporting rifles had a positive impact on our net sales and gross margins during fiscal with increased consumer demand and customer acceptance 
we completed the restructuring plan to move the production of our hunting products from rochester  new hampshire to our springfield  massachusetts facility resulting in million in relocation costs  of which million was attributed to cost of sales and  related to operating expenses 
we incurred  higher consolidation costs in fiscal than in fiscal  of which  was higher in cost of sales and  was higher in operating expenses 
the restructuring also resulted in a reduction of gross profit because of the negative impact on lost efficiencies in our hunting firearms 
legal and consulting costs were million  which is million lower than the million of costs incurred in the prior year related to the doj and sec investigations referenced in item a  risk factors 
our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms 
we sell our products under the smith wesson brand  the m p brand  the thompson center brand  and the walther brand 
we manufacture a wide array of handguns  modern sporting rifles  hunting rifles  black powder firearms  handcuffs  and firearm related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers  including gun enthusiasts  collectors  hunters  sportsmen  competitive shooters  individuals desiring home and personal protection  law enforcement and security agencies and officers  and military agencies in the united states and throughout the world 
we are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns  modern sporting rifles  and handcuffs in the united states  and an active participant in the hunting rifle market 
we manufacture our firearm products at our facilities in springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine 
we plan to continue to offer products that leverage the year old smith wesson brand and capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic american tradition by expanding consumer awareness of products we produce 
in addition  we pursue opportunities to license our name and trademarks to third parties for use in association with their products and services 

table of contents key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use adjusted ebitdas earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  excluding large non recurring items  which is a non gaap financial metric  to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various firearm products by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  us handgun sales increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns because of the fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
sales levels then returned to pre levels and grew at normal industry growth rates until late in calendar  when sales increased in what appears to be fears surrounding crime and terrorism  an economic downturn  and a change in the white house administration 
like the increase in  this increase in sales was temporary in nature and sales returned to more normal levels in fiscal it appears that sales have recently increased because of increased social acceptance and awareness from current media outlets 
we also believe the variety of our products we have available in the market and the attractive price points we maintain contributes to our increased market share 
we estimate that we have an share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with approximately in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in and approximately during the s 
results of operations net sales the following table sets forth certain information regarding net product and services sales for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change handguns walther modern sporting rifles hunting firearms parts accessories total firearms non firearms total net sales fiscal net sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year as we were able to address increased consumer demand because of increases in production capacity  particularly for handgun products  which saw a net sales increase of over the prior fiscal year  most noticeably on polymer pistol products 
walther net sales declined from the prior fiscal year because of increased competition in small frame  concealed carry products  and rimfire products 
net sales of modern sporting rifles rebounded in with net sales in this category increasing by million in the current fiscal year primarily because of strong demand for the sport model we introduced late in fiscal that hits an attractive price point 
hunting firearms net sales were lower than in the prior fiscal year as a result of lower orders for black powder products  constrained bolt action rifle sales as we service the thompson center arms venture rifle recall  and productivity and efficiency losses as we completed the move of our hunting production to our springfield  massachusetts facility 
parts and accessories sales increased primarily because of the volume increases in our handgun category and modern sporting rifles 
our order backlog as of april  was million  million higher than at the end of fiscal and million higher than at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of backlog generated by new products and increased consumer demand for our handgun and modern sporting rifle products 
the orders received that have not yet shipped could be cancelled  particularly if demand were to suddenly decrease 
therefore  our backlog may not be indicative of future sales  particularly since the order demand currently exceeds our manufacturing capacity 
net sales into our sporting goods distribution channel were million  a million  or  increase over sales of million in fiscal  primarily driven by increased customer demand for our polymer pistols and modern sporting rifles 
net sales into our professional channels were million  a  or  increase from fiscal net sales of million 
law enforcement channel net sales were higher  in part  because of increased shipments of our polymer pistol products to state agencies  such as the massachusetts and vermont state police  as well as an increase in handcuffs shipments to the california state police 
international sales  which include some consumer related sales  declined from fiscal because of the variable nature of international agency sales  which has been exacerbated as a result of our focus on fewer  but larger  international customers 

table of contents fiscal net sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased as orders returned to more normal levels compared with the strong consumer demand that occurred after the november presidential election 
handgun net sales increased over the prior fiscal year because of customer acceptance of our smaller concealed carry personal protection handgun products that were newly introduced 
walther net sales declined from the prior fiscal year because of increased competition in small frame and concealed carry products 
sales of modern sporting rifles  the product line most impacted by the reduction in consumer demand  declined by from the prior fiscal year 
however  sales within this product line were favorably impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal by the introduction of a new model that hit attractive price points 
hunting product sales increased over the prior fiscal year because of increased bolt action  rimfire  and black powder net sales 
net sales into our sporting goods distribution channel were million  a million  or  increase over sales of million in fiscal net sales into our professional channels were million  a million  or  decrease from fiscal sales of million 
law enforcement channel net sales were lower  in part  because of reduced shipments to state and local government agencies 
international sales declined from fiscal sales as a result of substantial changes we made in our foreign sales personnel and foreign representatives  modifications we made in our foreign sales processes  and our determination not to sell our products in certain foreign countries 
cost of sales and gross profit the following table sets forth certain information regarding cost of sales and gross profit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change cost of sales of net sales gross profit of net sales fiscal cost of sales and gross profit compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily because of an increase in sales volume of our polymer products and modern sporting rifles  as noted above  resulting in a corresponding improvement in manufacturing absorption 
in addition  we also had less inventory reserve adjustments and lower product liability related legal fees 
these reductions were offset by million of increased warranty costs associated with the recall of all our thompson center arms venture rifles manufactured since the product s introduction in mid and million of increased consulting services for procurement cost savings initiatives during the period 
fiscal cost of sales and gross profit compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year because of a decrease in sales volume 
in addition  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased as a result of a targeted price repositioning strategy for several of our products aimed at increasing market share 
this repositioning resulted in a one time credit of million to certain distributors and large retailers to protect their inventory in the distribution channel from the price reduction  which also negatively impacted gross margin 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by the additional promotional activity prior to the price repositioning in fiscal  increased distributor incentives in the second half of the fiscal year of million  million of costs associated with the consolidation of our hunting production from our rochester  new hampshire facility to our springfield  massachusetts facility  and related production and labor inefficiencies associated with the restructuring 

table of contents operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses of net sales fiscal operating expenses compared with fiscal research and development expenses were relatively flat over the prior fiscal year with increased salary and benefit costs offset by reduced consulting services 
the reduced selling and marketing expenses was primarily a result of a million reduction in consulting and outside services as a result of cost cutting initiatives implemented late in fiscal and reduced spending from improvements made during fiscal in our customer acceptance process  market research and consulting  and licensing consulting 
general and administrative costs were relatively flat compared with the prior fiscal year representing reductions associated with million of reduced legal and consulting fees related our investigation of the doj and sec matters  million reduced bad debt expense   of reduced legal fees because of an international trade commission itc action against several of our black powder competitors in fiscal and reduced consulting expenses for internal audit activities 
these amounts were offset by million of higher profit sharing   of higher stock based compensation expense  and million of higher management incentive compensation accrual 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by  predominately because of the reduced costs related to the doj and sec matters and cost cutting initiatives put in place late in fiscal  and increased net sales 
fiscal operating expenses compared with fiscal the increase in research and development expenses over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased test samples to support new product development 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was a result of increased consulting and outside services of million  which included improvements as discussed above  as well as advertising of million in support of new product launches and cooperative advertising cost sharing agreements with several of our large retail customers 
the increase in general and administrative costs over the prior fiscal year included million of legal and consulting fees related our investigation of the doj and sec matters   of bad debt costs   of legal fees related to the filing of the itc action against several of our black powder competitors  million of severance costs  and  in consulting fees related to internal audit activities 
these amounts were offset by million of lower profit sharing  million of lower stock based compensation expense  and million of lower management incentive compensation 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by  predominately due to a million increase in costs related to the doj and sec matters  severance costs related to the production move of our hunting products to our springfield  massachusetts facility  and costs associated with the itc filing 
operating income from continuing operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating income from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating income from continuing operations of net sales 
table of contents fiscal operating income from continuing operations compared with fiscal the significant increase in operating income from continuing operations resulted from the increased sales volumes  the corresponding impacts of improved absorption  and the cost cutting initiatives noted above 
in addition  decreased spending related to the doj and sec matters and reduced spending associated with the relocation of our hunting production from our rochester  new hampshire facility to our springfield  massachusetts facility contributed to the increase in operating income 
fiscal operating income from continuing operations compared with fiscal the decline in operating income from continuing operations resulted from a decline in modern sporting rifle sales subsequent to the year long surge in consumer demand after the november presidential election  a corresponding increase in promotional costs to spur sales  and reduced pricing for several of our products 
in addition  increased spending related to the doj and sec matters and costs associated with the relocation of our hunting production from our rochester  new hampshire facility to our springfield  massachusetts facility contributed to a reduction in operating income 
interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change interest expense interest expense increased for fiscal compared with fiscal because of increased interest expense related to the senior notes  which bear interest at a rate of per annum compared with our former senior convertible notes the convertible notes  which bore interest at a rate of per annum 
in december  we were required to repurchase million of the convertible notes and we redeemed the remaining  of the convertible notes in january we also amortized an additional  of debt issuance costs that we wrote off in connection with reducing our line of credit in october interest expense increased for fiscal because of the early retirement of million of the convertible notes  which resulted in a  write off of debt refinancing costs 
this debt was exchanged for million of the senior notes  resulting in higher interest expense  primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal the exchange of the convertible notes for the higher coupon senior notes was made because of the impending december date on which holders of the convertible notes could require us to repurchase their convertible notes as well as to remove the dilutive effects of the convertible notes 
income tax expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income tax expense our income tax expense for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between book value and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled million  after valuation allowance  as of april  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to  million  and million as of april    and  respectively 
we obtained million in additional loss carryforwards through our acquisition of swss on july   the majority of which was utilized in fiscal the net operating loss carryforwards at april  expire in fiscal internal revenue code section limits our utilization of these losses to approximately  in fiscal and each subsequent year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in a reduction in some or all of our loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that could be utilized 
adjustments to reserves and book versus tax difference on amortization of intangible assets increased the overall net deferred tax asset from million as of april  to million as of april  there were million and million of state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  and  respectively 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between april  and april  there were million and million of state tax credit carryforwards as of april  and  respectively 
the state tax credit carryforwards will expire between april  and april  
table of contents as of april   valuation allowances of  and million were provided on our deferred tax assets for state net operating losses and state tax credits  respectively  that we do not anticipate using prior to their expiration and a  valuation allowance was provided on other state deferred tax assets for which we anticipate we will realize no benefit 
as of april   valuation allowances of   and  were provided on our deferred tax assets for a federal capital loss carryforwards  state net operating losses  and state tax credits  respectively 
the increase in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for state net operating losses and credits and other deferred tax assets related mainly to our discontinued operations in tennessee 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
in order to utilize the unreserved portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  the minimum level of annual taxable income that we would have to achieve must equal or exceed the amount of federal net operating carryforwards for fiscal through our management believes that achievement of that level of taxable income is more likely than not based on historical performance and future projections  including new product offerings  pricing decisions  marketing efforts and expected spending levels 
income from continuing operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding income from continuing operations and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands  except per share data change change income from continuing operations net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted fiscal income from continuing operations compared with fiscal income from continuing operations of million for fiscal was million higher than the million recorded in fiscal income from continuing operations increased primarily because of increased net sales volumes and corresponding gross profit 
we also experienced significantly less professional and consulting fees and realized the benefit of a lower tax rate through tax planning initiatives during fiscal fiscal income from continuing operations compared with fiscal income from continuing operations of million for fiscal was significantly below net income of million for fiscal the million reduction in income from continuing operations resulted from a million increase in doj and sec investigation costs during fiscal  a reduction in gross profit because of increasing price competitiveness subsequent to the post november election surge  and costs associated with the relocation of our hunting operations to our springfield  massachusetts facility 
discontinued operations the following is a summary of the operating results of discontinued operations of our security solutions division for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands  except per share data change change net sales from discontinued operations income loss before income taxes income loss from discontinued operations basic discontinued operations diluted discontinued operations 
table of contents net sales from discontinued operations for fiscal decreased from fiscal  resulting primarily from reduced or delayed demand because of federal budget constraints 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included a million non cash charge related to the expected loss on the sale of tangible and intangible assets 
loss from discontinued operations was significantly lower in fiscal due to the inclusion of a million impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets that was recorded during fiscal in addition  fiscal included million of income associated with a reduction in contingent consideration for shares held for issuance to former stockholders in connection with our acquisition of swss 
excluding the loss on sale in fiscal  the adjusted loss would have been million 
excluding the impairment charge and the income from the valuation of contingent consideration  the adjusted loss for fiscal would have been million 
adjusted loss from discontinued operations was million higher for fiscal because of the significant reduction in sales and the related impact on gross margin along with additional severance costs associated with the planned divestiture of the business 
these reductions were partially offset by reduced operating expenses from cost cutting initiatives and a reduction in payroll and benefit costs resulting from lower headcount 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our operations  including any potential acquisitions  and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flows from operating activities was lower in fiscal compared with fiscal because of an million reduction in accounts payable as we were able to pay down balances because of our cash position at year end  a million increase in inventories from increased production capacity and in preparation for a new product introduced late in fiscal  and a million decrease in accrued taxes other than income because of the timing of federal excise tax payments 
these reductions in operating activities were offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable because of our efforts to reduce the amount of time our sales remain in accounts receivable  a million reduction in income tax receivable related to the timing of income tax payments  and a million increase in accrued profit sharing from the increase in profitability from continuing operations 
in addition  in fiscal  income tax payments were significantly higher as a result of our higher taxable income 
cash flows from operating activities increased significantly in fiscal over fiscal levels in spite of the reduction in profitability because of a million reduction in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payable  and an million increase in accrued taxes other than income 
accounts receivable declined compared with the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of timing of fourth quarter sales 
accounts payable were high at the end of fiscal  primarily due to significant capital spending incurred late in the fourth quarter to meet the requirements of the massachusetts economic development incentive program that granted us up to million in refundable tax credits for capital spending on qualified property that exceeded million 
accrued taxes other than income increased as a result of a change in federal excise tax deposit requirements from bi weekly to quarterly  allowing our first calendar quarterly payment to be made on may   which was after the end of our fiscal year 
in addition  in fiscal  income tax payments were significantly higher as a result of our higher taxable income 
cash used in investing activities was lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily because of a million reduction in capital spending compared with fiscal as we started to increase production capacity and had additional spending related to our edip refundable tax credit obligation late in fiscal this reduction was partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of our foundry business 
we have estimated that it will take million to complete our current construction in progress 
cash used in investing activities was lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily because fiscal included million invested for the july acquisition of swss  partially offset by increased capital spending on property and equipment of million 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal included the repurchase of million of the convertible notes  million in cash paid for debt issue costs associated with the exchange of the convertible notes to senior notes late in fiscal  offset by proceeds of million in refundable tax credit received from the massachusetts economic development incentive program compared with fiscal  which included the net exchange of million of the convertible notes for senior notes 
during may and june  we purchased a total of million of our senior notes utilizing cash on hand 
we paid  of interest premium relating to these purchases 
at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating million 

table of contents cash used in financing activities in fiscal reflected the net exchange of million of the convertible notes for the senior notes and no other borrowing activity compared with fiscal  which included million of long term debt repayments offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we had restricted cash totaling million as of april   of which million acts as a compensating balance against our line of credit dated december  and  is related to the environmental remediation required to be performed in accordance with our credit facility with td bank 
we have a million revolving line of credit with td bank  na td bank  with no balance outstanding as of april  during fiscal  we repurchased all million of the convertible notes with cash on hand 
our credit agreement with td bank contains financial covenants relating to maintaining maximum leverage and minimum debt service coverage 
the indenture relating to the senior notes contains a financial covenant relating to times interest earned 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of april  based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our net sales  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make 
further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
our significant estimates include gross margin and percentage of completion on in process security solutions projects  accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax expense  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  asset impairments  medical claims payable  and the loss on the sale of our discontinued operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for our firearm products  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for our discontinued security solutions segment  we recognize revenue from fixed price installation contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to our total costs for each contract 
as noted above  revenue from our security solutions division has been classified as discontinued operations 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our firearm revenue 
we recognize revenue from firearm product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectability is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we determine percentage of completion by comparing the cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost required to complete the project 
we consider costs incurred to date to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
we make adjustments to estimates to complete in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  we record the loss in the period in which it is identified 
when reliable estimates cannot be made  we recognize revenue upon completion 
significant judgment is involved in the estimation process for each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
delays in the installation process could negatively affect operations in a given period by increasing volatility in revenue recognition 
recognition of revenue in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenue 

table of contents we recognize trademark licensing revenue for individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on historical experience and expected cash receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize non refundable license fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectability does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not recognize minimum royalty payments upon contract signing but instead record royalty revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to million 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  patents  trademarks  and tradenames 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets either on a straight line basis or based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of such assets 
we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis on february and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of asc with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review of the segment reporting topic  asc  we have determined that we operate our continuing operations in one reporting unit for our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities 
as of april   we had no goodwill recorded on our books for continuing operations 
based on a combination of factors that occurred during fiscal  including federal and corporate budgetary constraints  increased price competition  low barrier to entry  and other factors  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our discontinued security solutions division and  as a result  we conducted an evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of that business 
based on the earnings and cash flow forecast for the next years  the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss in discontinued operations of million in fiscal we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as noted above  economic and market conditions that affected our discontinued security solutions division required us to test for impairment of long lived assets pertaining to that business in fiscal based on that assessment  we recorded an impairment charge in discontinued operations of million to reflect the excess of the carrying value of long lived intangible assets over the discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal   or for continuing operations based on the review of long lived assets 

table of contents we utilize an income approach  with discounted cash flows  to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
we selected this method because we believe that it most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we considered using the market approach and the cost approach  but concluded that they were not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant and available market comparisons 
the income approach is based on the projected cash flows that are discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating cash performance 
this approach also mitigates the impact of the cyclical trends that occur in our industries 
fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts and assumptions 
the discount rate used is the average estimated value of a market participant s cost of capital and debt  derived using customary market metrics 
other significant assumptions include terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
we also compare and reconcile our overall fair value to our market capitalization 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to our application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
the foregoing assumptions were consistent with our long term performance  with limited exceptions 
we believe that our future investments for capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue will decline in future years due to our improved utilization resulting from lean initiatives  and we believe that days sales outstanding will decline as we grow 
we also have assumed that through the current economic downturn  our markets have not contracted for the long term  however  it may be a number of years before they fully recover 
these assumptions could deviate materially from actual results 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist  and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including technological advances  increased competition  and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
a change in the weighted average cost of capital  for example  could materially change the valuation and  if increased  could cause an impairment 
in turn  this could have an additional impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and impairment charges 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of products and services sold 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs related to this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
as of april   the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses was zero 
environmental liability we provide reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which reasonable estimates of such obligations can be made 
on march   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the land and building located in rochester  new hampshire  pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify the buyer for losses arising from  among other things  environmental conditions related to thompson center arms manufacturing activities 
as of april   we had a reserve of million  including million relating to the land and building located in rochester  new hampshire  for environmental matters  which is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
we believe the likelihood of environmental remediation costs exceeding the amount accrued to be remote
