selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling expenses for the year ended december  was mainly due to the increase in both business volume and advertising expenditures 
advertising expense accounted for and of the total selling expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increases were caused by stock based compensation and business acquisition occurred in year also in the fourth quarter of year the management decided to expense the part of the research deposit we paid in year  approximately million for acquiring a proprietary technology which currently is still under research and development  and this resulted in significant increase of our research and development expenses for the year ended december  
table of contents stock based compensation our board of directors adopted a stock option incentive plan in august the values of options granted under the plan and valued using black scholes merton pricing model and expensed over the term of their respective vesting periods 
stock awards are valued using the market price on or around the date the shares were awarded and included as a period compensation expense

our future capital expenditures will include  among others  expanding product lines  research and development capabilities  and making acquisitions as deemed appropriate 
based on our current plans for the next months  we anticipate that the sales of the company s pharmaceutical products will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in however  to fund continued expansion of our operation and extend our reach to broader markets  and to acquire additional entities  as we may deem appropriate  we may rely on bank borrowing  if available  as well as capital raises 
there is no assurance that we will find such funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily due to our net income of million  adjusted by non cash related expenses including million impairment loss on land use rights  depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  and research and development expenses of million  offset by a non cash gain of million on bargain purchase from business acquisition and a net increase in working capital items of million

table of contents critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of customer accounts and management s best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss  taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers 
management evaluates the collectability of the receivables at least quarterly 
if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate further  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
such differences could be material and could significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
the following table sets out the aging of our accounts receivable  before allowance for doubtful accounts  for each balance sheet periods presented 
accounts receivable aging total days days days days days days as of december  as of december  the following table presents the days sales outstanding calculated based on sales and accounts receivables for the years ended december  and year ended december  days sales outstanding the number of days that sales were outstanding increased to days for the year ended december  from days for the year of the following are steps the company takes in collecting accounts receivable step after the payment term has been exceeded  the company stops taking orders from the delinquent customer and allows the responsible sales person three to six months to collect the accounts receivable 
most of the accounts receivable will be collected in this step because the sales person s compensation is tied to sales receipts 
the company s normal sales term is days credit period 
step if the sales person s collection efforts are not successful  the company hires a collection agent and allows the agent another three to six months to collect the accounts receivable 
step if the collection agent s efforts are not successful  the company will commence legal action to collect the accounts receivable 

table of contents our policies for writing off the accounts receivable are as follows if after taking legal action  it appears that an accounts receivable is not likely to become collectible  such accounts receivable will be written off if it is more than two years old 
if during the collection period  the customer provides bankruptcy or other insolvency documentation  the corresponding accounts receivable will be written off 
if we are no longer able to locate a particular customer in order for us to take any collection or legal actions  the accounts receivable for such customer will be written off if it is more than two years old 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future pricing and market conditions 
if actual future demands  future pricing or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required and the differences could be material 
such differences might significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
judgment is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets  especially for computer equipment  including determining how long existing equipment can function and when new technologies will be introduced at cost effective price points to replace existing equipment 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
valuation of intangibles from time to time  we acquire intangible assets that are beneficial to our product development processes 
management periodically evaluates the carrying value of intangibles  including the related amortization periods 
in evaluating acquired intangible assets  management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of the product line with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on either a discounted cash flows analysis or market analysis 
future operating income is based on various assumptions  including regulatory approvals  patents being granted  and the type and nature of competing products 
if regulatory approvals or patents are not obtained or are substantially delayed  or other competing technologies are developed and obtain general market acceptance or market conditions otherwise change  our intangibles may have a substantially reduced value  which could be material 
during the th quarter of  following the protracted negotiations with the local government of zouan town  xi an city  the company determined to give up the land use right for the construction of raw materials processing plant in zouan town 
the land use right for the  square meter facility was acquired in in consideration for rmb million approximately million 
the company s determination was preceded by ongoing attempts to resolve a labor dispute with the local government relating to a previous paper mill labor force on this site to be retained by the company following its acquisition of the property and business  which attempts yielded no positive results 
in march  the company reached an agreement with the local government by paying back part of the consideration paid for the land rmb million  approximately million 
the foregoing refund was recorded as other receivable in the fiscal year we also had to recognize approximately million loss for the same period 

table of contents in december  xianyang land reserve center  the governmental entity that holds the title to all land in the shaanxi province  reclaimed approximately a  square meter portion of the real estate with carrying amount of rmb million or approximately million at our xianyang  shaanxi province headquarters  none of which have been used by our company 
we leased all  square meters of real estate in xianyang under year land use right expiring in june at the time of the lease commencement in  all of the land was designated for industrial use  however  in  the local municipal construction planning department repurposed a portion of the real estate for residential use 
as a result  the company expects to be reimbursed by the local government for the reclaimed portion of its real estate and the land use right  in the amount of approximately rmb million or approximately million no later than june the company understands that the land is then to be auctioned by the local government  and the company is also entitled to receive of the final bid price exceeding the amount of rmb million or million  but in no event to exceed the amount of rmb million or million 
as a result of the foregoing  the company recorded million other receivable  million contingent assets  and million loss for the real estate in question 
the company anticipates for the auction and compensation process to be completed during the year income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  management s interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or management s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the financial statements 
management s assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render management s current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from the estimates  thus materially impact the financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency our functional currency is the us dollar  and our subsidiary and our vie in china use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies  ie the rmb 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
management must use judgment in determining an entity s functional currency  assessing economic factors including cash flow  sales price  sales market  expense  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
the impact from exchange rate changes related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency is recorded as a gain and loss in the statements of operations  while the impact from exchange rate changes related to translating a foreign entity s financial statements from the functional currency to its reporting currency  the us dollar  is disclosed and accumulated in a separate component under the equity section of the balance sheets 
different judgments or assumptions resulting in a change of functional currency may materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc  business combinations 
under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes percent of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  regardless of the percentage owned  at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
to the extent the fair value of net assets acquired  including other identifiable assets  exceed the purchase price  a bargain purchase gain is recognized 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair value  if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
results of operations of an acquired business are included in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition 
acquisition related costs  including conversion and restructuring charges  are expensed as incurred 
we adopted this guidance as of january  and applied it to the meipude and shaanxi weinan acquisitions 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total within year years years years research and development expense purchases of intellectual property total contractual obligations 
table of contents inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations
