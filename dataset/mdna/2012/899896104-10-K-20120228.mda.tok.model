the company s goodwill and intangible assets relate primarily to the december acquisition of the direct selling businesses of sara lee corporation and the october acquisition of beauticontrol 
the company conducts an annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets in the third quarter of each year  other than for beauticontrol where the annual valuation is performed in the second quarter  and in other quarters in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred 
the impairment assessment is completed by estimating the fair value of the reporting units and intangible assets and comparing these estimates with their carrying values 
in the second quarter of  the company noted the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flow of the nutrimetics and naturcare businesses were below the company s projections used in its previous valuations  as was the forecast for growth in future periods

transactions in one period may not be representative of what may occur in future periods 
since the company began this program in  cumulative proceeds from these sales have totaled million and currently are expected to be up to an additional million when the program is completed 
the carrying value of the land included in the company s land sales program was million as of december  this amount was included in property  plant and equipment held for use within the consolidated balance sheet as it is not considered probable that any land sales will be completed within one year

the company is required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities  uncertain tax positions and assessments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets in determining the income tax provision 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits will ultimately be realized 
this assessment is based upon expectations of domestic operating and non operating results  foreign dividends and other foreign source income  as well as anticipated gains related to the company s future sales of land held for development near its orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
in evaluating uncertain tax positions  the company makes determinations regarding the application of complex tax rules  regulations and practices

also during  the company reduced its liability by million upon entering into certain advance pricing agreements 
during the year  the accrual for uncertain tax positions also increased for positions being taken in various tax filings 
the company estimates that it may settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that may result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount 
while the company does not currently expect material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments that could also  in turn  impact the company s assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items

table of contents financial condition liquidity and capital resources net working capital was million as of december   compared with million as of december  and million as of december  the current ratio was to at the end of  to at the end of and to at the end of the company s net working capital decreased as of the end of compared with  primarily reflecting a lower level of cash as of the end of and borrowings under its revolving credit facility  both of which were used to repurchase shares 
there was also an impact from a reduction in receivables reflecting the timing of collections around the company s fiscal year end 
there was a partial offset from a higher level of inventory to support a higher level of sales generally  along with more specific instances where inventory was increased in units to enable a better level of service to customers and in light of sales below expectations 
there was also an increase in deferred tax assets and a decrease in accrued liabilities largely from lower income taxes payable due to the timing of the company s tax liability around year end 
the higher net working capital as of the end  compared with  reflected a higher level of cash resulting both from the company s favorable operating results and cash flow 
the company also generated significant cash flow in  but used a portion of that cash to prepay million of term loans  while there were no such prepayments in the increase in net working capital was also impacted by a higher inventory level  reflecting the need to support a higher level of sales  partially offset by higher accounts payable  reflecting the timing of payments around the company s fiscal year in compared with  as well as higher accrued compensation and commissions resulting from the favorable sales and operating results 
on june   the company completed the sale of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june  the senior notes at an issue price of as well as entered into a new million multicurrency revolving credit agreement the credit agreement 
the proceeds were used to repay all of the company s million outstanding term loans under the company s previous credit facility from september old credit facility  which was terminated on the same date 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  dart industries inc the guarantor  has granted a security interest for the senior notes and the credit agreement in certain tupperware trademarks and service marks owned by the guarantor 
loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest under a formula that includes  at the company s option  one of three different base rates 
the company generally selects the london interbank offered rate libor for the applicable currency and interest period as its base for its interest rate 
as provided in the credit facility a margin is added to the base 
the applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing schedule based upon the ratio the consolidated leverage ratio of the consolidated funded indebtedness of the company and its subsidiaries to the consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of the company and its subsidiaries for the four fiscal quarters then most recently ended 
as of december   the company had million of euro denominated borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement which dictated a spread of basis points and gave the company a weighted average interest rate of percent on borrowings under the credit agreement 
the company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the credit agreement during each quarter to fund operations and financing activities  and uses cash available at the end of the period to reduce borrowing levels 
as a result  the company has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than at the end of each quarter 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants requiring minimum interest coverage and allowing a maximum amount of leverage 
as of december   the company had  and currently has  considerable leeway under its financial covenants 
however  economic conditions  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  lower than foreseen sales and profit or the occurrence of other events discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere could cause noncompliance 

table of contents the interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings under the old credit facility was based on a floating libor base rate plus an applicable margin 
although the old credit facility was a floating rate instrument  the company was required to maintain at least percent of outstanding term loans at fixed rates  which was achieved through the use of interest rate swaps 
the old credit facility dictated a contractual spread of basis points and combined with the swap agreements  gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on the million borrowings in through their repayment 
in connection with the repayment of the borrowings under the old credit facility  the related interest rate swaps became ineffective  which resulted in a reclassification of million from other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the second quarter of the company monitors the financial stability of third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties  which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities 
furthermore  the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its working capital and capital spending needs and its current dividend 
this liquidity includes its year end cash and cash equivalents balance of million  cash flows from operating activities  and access to its million credit agreement 
as of december   the company had million available under its credit agreement and million available under other uncommitted lines of credit 
the company has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access its committed facility 
cash and cash equivalents cash totaled million as of december  of this amount  million was held by foreign subsidiaries 
approximately percent of this cash held outside of the united states was not eligible for repatriation due to the level of past statutory earnings by the foreign unit in which the cash was held 
the remaining cash is subject to repatriation tax effects 
the company s current intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds in its foreign operations  as it does not anticipate needing them in the united states 
in the event circumstances change  leading to the conclusion that these funds will not be indefinitely reinvested  the company would need to provide at that time for the income taxes that would be triggered upon their repatriation 
the company s two debt ratings agencies  standard and poor s and moody s  have both rated the company 
standard and poor s currently has a corporate credit rating on the company of bbb and has assigned a stable outlook 
moody s assigns a rating of baa with a stable outlook to the corporate family rating of the company 
business units in which the company generated at least million of sales in included brazil  tupperware france  fuller mexico  germany  indonesia  tupperware mexico and tupperware united states and canada 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets would adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force or the success of new products and or promotional programs 
on december   the company experienced a fire at its hemingway  sc facility  causing the complete destruction of its main finished goods warehouse and its contents 
in  the company finalized its claim with its insurance companies and received a total of million in proceeds during the year  bringing the total settlement to million to recover the value of destroyed inventory  property  plant and equipment  and costs associated with recovering from the fire  resulting in million in pretax gains related to the fire recorded in in  the company included in its consolidated statement of cash flows  million in proceeds in investing activities  as they related to property  plant and equipment 
the company netted  in  million of proceeds against capital expenditures  as these proceeds represented a direct reimbursement of costs associated with rebuilding the distribution capability of the hemingway facility 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with million in the decrease in operating cash flow in  notwithstanding a million increase in net income excluding the non cash impairment charges  primarily reflected the timing of distributions for payables and accruals around the beginning of each year and in light of the inclusion of a rd week in fiscal that caused a shift in the company s calendar at year end 
inventory levels also increased during due to purchases to support higher sales and customer service levels in certain markets and in light of sales below forecast in other markets 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in  reflecting the increase in net income for  compared with also contributing to the increase was a higher inflow from accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting mainly from the timing of payments made at the end of the company s fiscal year compared with  partially offset by an outflow from a higher level of inventory in versus a small reduction in  and a cash outflow to settle foreign currency hedge contracts in  compared with an inflow in insurance proceeds in included million in recoveries  net of expenses  from flood damage in australia

in  the company also had road costs related to the orlando property and spent million to improve the distribution capability at the company s hemingway facility in south carolina  following the destruction of its main finished goods warehouse at that facility 
the cost of this project was reimbursed by insurance proceeds and is shown net in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
partially offsetting the capital spending were million  million and million of proceeds related to the sale of certain property  plant and equipment and insurance recoveries in  and  respectively 
in  these proceeds were primarily from the sale of automobiles in markets where the company purchases vehicles as incentive awards to some of its sales force members as well as the sale of land held for development near the company s headquarters in orlando  florida 
in both and  proceeds resulted from the sale of excess property in australia and the sale of automobiles 
in  there were also proceeds from the sale of the company s former manufacturing facility in halls  tennessee 
insurance proceeds in included recoveries from the fire in south carolina 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

in october  the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend that was increased to per share from the per share that had been declared and paid each quarter since the company became public in in november  the board of directors further increased the quarterly dividend declared to per share 
the company expects its board of directors to evaluate its dividend rate annually in the first quarter of each year  beginning in as a result  subsequent to year end  the board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of per share  beginning with the payment in april the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision and subject to a significant event that would require cash  the ability to continue to comply with debt covenants  cash needed to finance operations  making necessary investments in the future growth of the business  required or discretionary debt repayment obligations or other cash needs 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its dividend payout 

table of contents stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  related to the exercise of stock options 
the higher amount of stock option proceeds during was due primarily to an increase in the company s stock price and the holders decisions to exercise  including how long before the expiration of the options year terms 
in and  the company issued stock from treasury shares when stock options were exercised 
in  until the third quarter when it began repurchasing shares  the company used previously unissued shares 
stock repurchases the company s board of directors increased its existing share repurchase authorization in february to allow repurchases with an aggregate cost of up to million until february  the company expected  at that time  to use proceeds from stock option exercises and excess cash generated by the business to offset dilution associated with the company s equity incentive plans  with the intention of keeping the number of shares outstanding at about million 
in  the company s board further increased the share repurchase authorization by million to million in january and by an additional million in october to billion 
going forward  in setting share repurchase amounts  the company expects to target over time a debt to ebitda ratio of x as defined in the company s credit agreement 
during  and the company repurchased million  million and million shares under this program at an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively 
since inception of the program in may and through december   the company has repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
the company has received  from time to time  shares to pay the exercise price by employees and directors who exercise stock options granted under stock incentive plans  which are commonly referred to as stock swap exercises 
in  the company began allowing participants to net share settle their stock options where the company issues a number of shares representing the value of the spread between the option exercise price and the then current market value of the shares subject to the option 
in  options for the purchase of million shares  with an aggregate exercise price value of million  were exercised under this method 
in and  a minimal amount of options were exercised under this method 
employees are also allowed to use shares to pay withholding taxes up to the minimum statutory amount on all stock incentive plans 
for and  the value of shares used for withholding taxes was million and million  respectively  which is included as stock repurchases in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 
total less than year years years more than years debt obligations interest payments on long term obligations pension benefits post employment medical benefits income tax payments a capital commitments b operating lease obligations total contractual obligations c a the company has not included in the above table amounts related to its other unrecognized tax positions  as it is unable to make a reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these items might lead to payments 
as of december  the company s total gross unrecognized tax positions were million 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
b capital commitments represent signed agreements as of december  on relatively minor capital projects in process in the company s brazil  indonesia and switzerland units 
c the table excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding  are generally consistent from year to year  and are short term in nature 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand and selling price 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management or the estimate of the market value of inventory on hand decreases  additional inventory write downs would be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of these total assets  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon future operating and non operating income generated from the united states businesses of tupperware and beauticontrol  as well as foreign dividends and other foreign source income 
also  expected gains related to future sales of land around the company s orlando  florida headquarters would result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
as of december  and december   the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
during the year ended december   the company settled certain tax positions in various foreign countries which included a payment of million of interest and taxes 
as a result of the settlement  the company s unrecognized tax benefit decreased by million  and related accruals for interest and penalties decreased by million 
also during  the company reduced its liability by million upon entering into certain advance pricing agreements 
during the year  the accrual for uncertain tax positions also increased for positions being taken in various tax filings 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the company s global operations are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million and million for and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a benefit of million to the provision related to interest and penalties from the reversals of certain accruals made in previous years 

table of contents the company estimates that it may settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that may result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to million 
for the remaining balance as of december   the company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount 
while the company does not currently expect material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments that could also  in turn  impact the company s assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets 
at this time  the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items 
promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october and the sara lee direct selling businesses in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the former sara lee direct selling units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that leads the company to determine that a triggering event for impairment testing has occurred  a test is completed at that time 
the impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure for a goodwill impairment loss 
this step revalues all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to their current fair values and then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

table of contents the valuation of goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of operations of the eight individual reporting units identified 
fair value of the reporting units is determined by the company using either the income approach or a combination of the income and market approach with generally a greater weighting on the income approach percent 
the income approach  or discounted cash flow approach  requires significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows  including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates as to the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this valuation is the projection of operating cash flows  as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the company s cash flow model uses forecasts for periods of about years and a terminal value 
the significant assumptions for these forecasts included annual revenue growth rates ranging from zero to percent with an average growth rate of percent 
the growth rates are determined by reviewing historical results of these units and the historical results of other of the company s business units that are similar to those of the reporting units  along with the expected contribution from growth strategies implemented in the units 
terminal values for all reporting units were calculated using a long term growth rate of percent 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units in  the company applied discount rates to its reporting units projected cash flows ranging from to percent 
the discount rate at the higher end of this range was for the avroy shlain and latin american reporting units due to higher country specific risk 
the market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar to tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples 
the publicly traded companies used in the market approach were selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods  beauty products and or companies using a direct selling distribution method 
the resulting multiples were then applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and tradenames acquired in conjunction with its purchase of the sara lee direct selling businesses 
the fair value of the company s tradenames was determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
in this method  the value of the asset is calculated by selecting royalty rates which estimate the amount a company would be willing to pay for the use of the asset 
these rates were applied to the company s projected revenue  tax affected and discounted to present value using an appropriate rate 
royalty rates used were selected by reviewing comparable trademark licensing agreements in the market  and a range from to percent was used in in estimating the fair value of the tradenames  the company also applied a discount rate ranging from to percent  and revenue growth ranging from zero to percent  with an average growth rate of percent  and a long term terminal growth rate of percent 
similar to the rates used in valuing the goodwill  the discount rates towards the high end of the range related to tradenames located in areas with higher country risks  such as revenue generated using the avroy shlain tradenames in south africa and the nuvo tradename in uruguay 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units and tradenames  other than beauticontrol  which was completed in the second quarter 
during the third quarter of  the financial results of nutrimetics were below expectations 
as well  the company made the decision to cease operating its nutrimetics business in malaysia 
as a result  the company lowered its forecast of future sales and profit 
the result of the impairment tests was to record a million impairment to the nutrimetics goodwill in the asia pacific reporting unit and a million impairment to its tradename 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided it would cease separately operating its swissgarde unit in southern africa 
as a result of this decision and its expected impact on the swissgarde sales force  the company concluded that its intangible assets and goodwill were impaired and recorded a million impairment to the swissgarde tradename  a million impairment related to the sales force intangible asset and a million impairment to goodwill relating to the south african beauty reporting unit 
during  the company sold its interest in swissgarde for million that resulted in a gain of million 

table of contents in  the company recorded impairment charges related to its naturcare  nutrimetics and south african businesses  in part  due to the fact that current and forecasted future results of operations were below its prior projections 
also contributing to the impairments was an overall increase to the assumed discount rates used in the valuations 
in  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename  a million impairment to the naturcare tradename and a million impairment to the avroy shlain tradename 
in addition to the impairment of tradenames  the company also recognized impairments of goodwill of million and million relating to the nutrimetics and south african beauty reporting units  respectively 
there were no impairments resulting from the respective annual impairment tests in with the goodwill impairment recorded in for nutrimetics asia pacific  this unit is at a higher risk of additional impairments in future periods if changes in certain assumptions occur 
this is also the case for the nutrimetics tradename value  as the fair value was set equal to carrying value in the third quarter of the fair value of the avroy shlain  fuller mexico  fuller philippines  naturcare and nutrimetics europe reporting units as well as the nuvo and avroy shlain trade names exceeded the carrying value by over percent at the valuation date 
the fair value of the fuller latin america and beauticontrol reporting units exceeded the carrying value by almost percent 
the fair value of the company s fuller and naturcare tradenames reflected an excess of and percent over carrying value  respectively 
given the sensitivity of the valuations to changes in cash flow or market multiples  the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the company s performance 
actual results below forecasted results or a decrease in the forecasted future results of the company s business plans or changes in interest rates could also result in an impairment charge  as could changes in market characteristics including declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
further impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income 
additionally  as of december  the company had million included on its consolidated balance sheets as the value of acquired sales forces 
the estimated annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the product formulation asset recorded as part of the acquisition was fully amortized 
retirement obligations pensions the company records pension costs and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans using the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this guidance requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the retirement obligations and costs of providing benefits under the company s pension plans involves various factors  including several assumptions 
the company believes the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate and government bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension expense for the company s us and foreign plans was as follows discount rate us plans foreign plans 
table of contents the company has established strategic asset allocation percentage targets for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return 
the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  in an effort to improve return and manage risk 
the estimated rate of return is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
the expected rate of return assumptions used by the company for its us and foreign plans were as follows expected rate of return us plans foreign plans the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  in millions impact on pension expense discount rate change by basis points expected rate of return on plan assets change by basis points other post retirement benefits the company accounts for its post retirement benefit plan in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of various assumptions  including a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plan 
the discount rate assumptions used by the company to determine other post retirement benefit expense were percent  percent  and percent for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
a change in discount rate of basis points would not be material 
the following are the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the company health care trend rates initial health care cost trend ultimate health care cost trend year ultimate trend rate achieved the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on post retirement benefit obligation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the price is fixed  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent distributors or a member of its independent sales force  and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 

table of contents stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options  which requires the input of assumptions  including dividend yield  risk free interest rate  the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation expense for these awards  the company is also required to estimate the extent to which options will be forfeited prior to vesting forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to the previously recorded amounts 
impact of inflation inflation  as measured by consumer price indices  has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates  except for argentina and venezuela 
new pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the second quarter of  the company terminated its old credit facility  entered into a new million credit agreement and issued million in senior notes 
one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on its borrowings 
the company s borrowings under the credit agreement carry a variable interest rate 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings and the currencies in which it borrows 
loans made under the revolving credit facility  depending on the length of the borrowing  generally bear interest in reference to the london interbank offered rate for the applicable currency and interest period  plus a margin 
the applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing schedule based upon the ratio the consolidated leverage ratio of the consolidated funded indebtedness of the company to its consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four fiscal quarters then most recently ended 
as of december   the credit agreement dictated a spread of basis points  which gave the company an interest rate of percent on its outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
consequently  if short term interest rates varied by percent with all other variables remaining constant  the company s annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted 
the company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the credit agreement during each quarter to fund operations and financing activities  and uses cash available at the end of the period to reduce borrowing levels 
as a result  the company has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than at the end of each quarter 
the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at the end of were denominated in euros 
under the old credit facility  the company managed its interest rate risk in through the use of four interest rate swaps 
these interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate on million of the company s million of outstanding term loans under the old credit facility 
the company paid a variable rate on the remaining million of term loans and any outstanding revolver borrowings 
as a result of the termination of the old credit facility  the four swaps became ineffective  which required a reclassification of million of losses from other comprehensive loss into interest expense in the second quarter of these swaps will expire in the third quarter of  and the remaining exposure to the fair value of these swaps is not expected to materially impact the results of the company 
a significant portion of the company s sales and profit come from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments and relations between foreign and us governments 

table of contents another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of its international operations 
the company is not able to project  in any meaningful way  the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts  future earnings or cash flows 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges  with these instruments  certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
the company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales  profit or cash flow generated by its operations 
while the company s hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
for the years ended december   december  and december  the cash flow impact of these currency hedges was an inflow of million  an outflow of of million and an inflow of million  respectively 
the us dollar equivalent of the company s most significant net open foreign currency hedge positions as of december  were to buy euro million and us dollars million and sell swiss francs million  japanese yen million  australian dollars million  and the turkish lira million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement  with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company s outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net receivable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which  upon settlement  could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 
a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations 
the risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the determination of fair value for the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action  as appropriate and possible  to further manage its counterparty credit risk 

table of contents the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and  in particular  the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of most tupperware products  and the company estimates that cost of sales will include about million for the cost of resin in the tupperware brand products it produces 
the company uses many different kinds of resins in its products 
about three fourths of its resins are polyolefins simple chemical structure  easily refined from oil  and as such  the price of these is strongly affected by the underlying price of oil and natural gas 
the remaining one fourth of its resins is more highly engineered  where the price of oil and natural gas plays a less direct role in determining price 
with a comparable product mix  a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the company s annual cost of sales by about million compared with the prior year 
for  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produced was negatively impacted by about million in local currency due to resin cost changes as compared with for the full year of  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produces will be positively impacted by about million  on a local currency basis  due to resin cost changes  as compared with the company partially manages its risk associated with rising resin costs by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation in each market  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering into forward contracts for resin is not practical or cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future
