these statements  including estimates  projections  statements related to business plans  strategies  objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements also include  without limitation  any statement that includes words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  seeks  will be  will continue  stancorp financial group  inc 

table of contents will likely result and similar expressions that are predictive in nature or that depend on or refer to future events or conditions 
our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
they involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed by stancorp with the sec  including forms k  q and k  which may include  but are not limited to  the factors listed in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements of this form k 
as a provider of financial products and services  our actual results of operations may vary significantly in response to economic trends  interest rates  investment performance  claims experience  operating expenses and pricing 
given these uncertainties or circumstances  investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements as a predictor of future results 
we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk factors risk factors that may affect our business are as follows our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business may prove to be inadequate for certain of our product lines  we establish and carry  as a liability  actuarially determined reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims 
these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of our future benefit liabilities but instead are estimates based on assumptions  which can be materially affected by changes in the economy  changes in social perceptions about work ethics  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging or changing health issues and changes in industry regulation 
claims experience on our products can fluctuate widely from period to period 
if actual events vary materially from our assumptions used when establishing the reserves to meet our obligations for future policy benefits and claims  we may be required to increase our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect our financial results our long term disability products provide coverage for claims incurred during the policy period 
generally  group policies offer rate guarantees for periods from one to three years 
while we can prospectively re price and re underwrite coverages at the end of these guarantee periods  we must pay benefits with respect to claims incurred during these periods without being able to increase guaranteed premium rates during these periods 
historically  approximately of all claims filed under our long term disability policies close within months 
however  claims caused by more severe disabling conditions may be paid over much longer periods  including  in some cases  up to normal retirement age or longer 
longer duration claims  in addition to a higher volume of claims than we expect  expose us to the possibility that we may pay benefits in excess of the amount that we anticipated when the policy was underwritten 
the profitability of our long term disability products is thus subject to volatility resulting from the difference between our actual claims experience and our assumptions at the time of underwriting 
we are exposed to concentration risk on our group life insurance business due to the nature of group life insurance coverage  we are subject to geographical concentration risk from the occurrence of a catastrophe 
catastrophe losses from a disease pandemic could have an adverse effect on us our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of loss from an occurrence of catastrophic mortality caused by a disease pandemic  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
catastrophe losses from terrorism or other factors could have an adverse effect on us an occurrence of a significant catastrophic event  including terrorism  natural or other disasters  or a change in the nature and availability of reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be exposed to disintermediation risk during periods of increasing interest rates in periods of increasing interest rates  withdrawals of annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns 
this process  referred to as disintermediation  may lead to net cash outflows 
these outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest annual report 
table of contents part i rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans  which are relatively illiquid  thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation during a period of rising interest rates 
our profitability may be adversely affected by declining or low interest rates during periods of declining or low interest rates  annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments  resulting in increases in the percentage of policies remaining in force from year to year during a period when our new investments carry lower returns 
during these periods  actual returns on our investments could prove inadequate for us to meet contractually guaranteed minimum payments to holders of our annuity products 
in addition  the profitability of our life and disability insurance products can be affected by declining or low interest rates 
a factor in pricing our insurance products is prevailing interest rates 
longer duration claims and premium rate guarantees can expose us to interest rate risk when portfolio yields are less than those assumed when pricing these products 
mortgages and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates  and we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
our investment portfolio is subject to risks of market value fluctuations  defaults  delinquencies and liquidity our general account investments primarily consist of fixed maturity securities available for sale fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate 
the fair values of our investments vary with changing economic and market conditions and interest rates 
in addition  we are subject to default risk on our fixed maturity securities portfolio and its corresponding impact on credit spreads 
our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is subject to delinquency  default and borrower concentration risks 
related declines in market activity due to overall declining values of fixed maturity securities may result in our fixed maturity securities portfolio becoming less liquid 
also  our commercial mortgage loans are relatively illiquid and the demand for our real estate owned may remain low due to macroeconomic conditions 
we may have difficulty selling our fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate owned at attractive prices  in a timely manner  or both if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice 
our business is subject to significant competition each of our business segments faces competition from other insurers and financial services companies  such as banks  broker dealers  mutual funds  and managed care providers for employer groups  individual consumers and distributors 
since many of our competitors have greater financial resources  offer a broader array of products and  with respect to other insurers  may have higher financial strength ratings than we do  the possibility exists that any one of our business segments could be adversely affected by competition  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business financial strength ratings  which are an indicator of our claims paying ability  are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and in our ability to market our products 
rating organizations regularly review the financial performance and condition of insurance companies  including our company 
a ratings downgrade could increase our surrender levels for our annuity products  could adversely affect our ability to market our products  could increase costs of future debt issuances  and could thereby have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our profitability may be affected by changes in state and federal regulation our business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the united states us including rules and regulations relating to income taxes and accounting principles generally accepted in the us while we cannot predict the impact of potential or future state or federal legislation or regulation on our business  future laws and regulations  or the interpretation thereof  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our deferred tax asset includes net operating losses which depend on future taxable income to be realized and may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes our deferred tax assets include federal  state and local net operating losses 
certain of our subsidiaries as a group have generated losses in recent years 
net operating losses can be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future taxable income 
there can be no assurance that we will generate the future taxable income necessary to utilize our net operating losses 
furthermore  stancorp financial group  inc 

table of contents the availability of these losses to be utilized in the future can become limited if certain changes in company structure or income levels occur 
in such a circumstance  we may be unable to utilize the losses even in the event the company generates future taxable income
