table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a leading manufacturer of engineered components utilized in a variety of applications and industries 
through our security products segment we manufacture mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in postal  office and institutional furniture  transportation  vending  tool storage and general cabinetry applications 
our furniture components segment manufactures precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems used in office and institutional furniture  home appliances  tool storage  healthcare and a variety of other applications 
we also manufacture stainless steel exhaust systems  gauges and throttle controls for the performance and ski wakeboard boat markets through our marine components segment 
operating income overview we reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and an operating loss of million in the comparison between and was primarily impacted by the positive impact of a litigation settlement gain in as well as the positive impact of lower litigation expense in  the positive impact of higher sales in from an increase in customer order rates primarily in security products due to improved economic conditions in north america  the negative impact in of relocation costs and production inefficiencies related to the consolidation of our precision slides facilities  the negative impact on margins in from higher raw material costs  the negative impact of a higher write down on assets held for sale in  and the negative impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the comparison between and was primarily impacted by the positive impact of higher sales in from an increase in customer order rates across all of our business segments due to improved economic conditions in north america  improved margins in due to an increase in utilization of production capacity and improved coverage of fixed manufacturing costs from the above noted higher sales  the positive impact of lower litigation expense in  and the negative impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates in

net sales increased approximately million in as compared to principally due to improved sales in the security products segment 
security products experienced a significant increase in sales to customers in the leisure transportation industry as well as improved customer order rates across most customers as a result of some improvement in the economy and new specific customer projects 
furniture components net sales were positively impacted by million in sales relating to the july acquisition of an ergonomics component products business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in sales was fully offset by a decrease in sales of our other ergonomics component products due to a decrease in customer projects associated with government spending 
additionally  we experienced a slight decline in overall demand for ergonomic products due to the somewhat discretionary nature of ergonomic products and the overall challenging economic environment 
net sales for marine components were comparable from to net sales increased approximately million in as compared to principally due to an increase in order rates from our customers resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
our furniture components  security products and marine components segments accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the total increase in sales year over year 
furniture components sales was a greater percentage of the total increase because this segment experienced a greater contraction in demand during the economic downturn in  resulting in a greater relative increase as customer demand began to return 
the marine components segment accounted for a smaller percentage of the total increase due to the smaller sales volume associated with that segment 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold increased from to primarily due to increased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased in from the prior year 
the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs  inefficiencies relating to the 
table of contents consolidation of furniture components facilities and the relative changes in currency exchange rates  partially offset by the positive impact of increased leverage of fixed costs from higher sales 
the gross margin impact relating to the above noted july acquistion of an ergonomics component products business was not significant 
cost of goods sold increased from to primarily due to increased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased in from the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to improved coverage of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs from higher sales volume and the related efficiency gains 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of sales and administrative related personnel costs  sales commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and administrative costs relating to business unit and corporate management activities  as well as gains and losses on plant  property and equipment and currency transaction gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses were comparable at in and operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased in compared to primarily due to selling  general and administrative costs increasing at a slower rate than sales volumes 
litigation settlement gain and expenses 
the litigation settlement gain recorded in of approximately million is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  as a result of the settlement  legal expenses relating to furniture components decreased approximately million in compared to patent litigation expenses relating to furniture components decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the timing of litigation proceedings  discussed above 
assets held for sale write down 
we recorded write downs on assets held for sale of million   and  in  and  respectively  relating to certain facilities held for sale that are no longer in use 
the write downs are included in corporate operating expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
the comparison of operating income for to was primarily impacted by the positive impact of a million settlement gain in and lower related litigation expense of approximately million  the negative impact of million of facility consolidation costs in  and related production inefficiencies  the negative impact of higher raw material costs  the million write down on assets held for sale in compared to  in  and the negative  impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the comparison of operating income for to was primarily impacted by a million improvement in gross profit in due to higher sales and continued control of fixed manufacturing costs  resulting in an increase in utilization of production capacity and improved coverage of fixed manufacturing costs  the positive impact of million in lower litigation expense in  and the negative million impact of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates in currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with 
table of contents the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
in addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time  our non us operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non local currency sales or operating costs are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non local currency 
overall  fluctuations in currency exchange rates had the following effects on our furniture component segment s net sales and operating income vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change impact on net sales operating income vs in thousands transaction gains losses translation gain loss impact of rate changes total currency impact vs change impact on net sales operating income the positive impact on sales for both comparative periods relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translated into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income for both comparative periods results from the us dollar denominated sales of us operations converted into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacted our gross margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in local currency 
general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and materials 
the materials used in our products consist of purchased components and raw materials some of which are subject to fluctuations in the commodity markets such as coiled steel  zinc  copper  plastic resin and stainless steel 
total material costs represented approximately of our cost of sales in  with commodity related raw materials accounting for approximately of our cost of sales 
worldwide commodity raw material costs declined in and began increasing in the second half of and continued increasing throughout we occasionally enter into short term commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
these arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes  which helps us to stabilize commodity related raw material purchase prices to a certain extent 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc  brass and 
table of contents coiled steel 
we expect commodity related raw material prices to increase in in conjunction with higher demand as a result of the expected improvement in the world wide economy 
these raw materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset cost increases for these raw materials with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income  net primarily includes interest income 
interest income was comparable at  in and  in interest income in both periods includes interest on our million promissory note receivable discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased approximately  in compared to primarily due to the higher interest earned on the million note receivable purchased in may which carried an average interest rate of during we expect our interest income to decrease in as a result of lower balances available for investment 
interest expense interest expense was comparable from to and to as the significant reduction to the note payable to affiliate of million was not paid until october the average interest rate on the note payable to affiliate at december    and was   and 
in addition  we averaged million and million outstanding on our revolving credit facility interest rate of at december  and at december  during and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our interest expense to decrease in as a result of lower debt balances outstanding 
provision for income taxes a tabular reconciliation between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory income tax rate of is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a member of the group of companies consolidated for us federal income tax purposes with contran  the parent of our consolidated us federal income tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
our separate company basis income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
generally  the effective tax rate on income derived from our us operations  including the effect of us state income taxes  is lower than the effective tax rate on income derived from our non us operations  in part due to the deferred tax on all of our foreign earnings as they are deemed to be not permanently reinvested and an election for each of the last three years to not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead to claim a tax deduction  consistent with the elections of contran 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease in our effective income tax rate is primarily due to a million provision for deferred income taxes recorded in on undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary discussed below 
our provision for income taxes in includes a million provision for deferred income taxes related to the undistributed earnings of our canadian subsidiary attributable to the million patent litigation settlement gain 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for to be lower than our effective rate for 
table of contents prior to the first quarter of  we had not recognized a deferred tax liability related to incremental income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary  as those earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested 
we are required to reassess the permanent reinvestment conclusion on an ongoing basis to determine if our intentions have changed 
at the end of march  and based primarily upon changes in our cash management plans  we determined that all of the undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary can no longer be considered permanently reinvested in taiwan 
accordingly  in the first quarter of we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
consequently  all of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations are now considered to not be permanently reinvested 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in  primarily as a result of the above mentioned million provision for deferred income taxes in related to undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
segment results the key performance indicator for our segments is the level of their operating income see discussion below

years ended december  change in millions net sales security products furniture components marine components total net sales gross profit security products furniture components marine components total gross profit operating income loss security products furniture components marine components corporate operating expenses total operating income loss operating income loss margin security products furniture components marine components total operating income margin security products 
security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales is primarily due to improved customer order rates across most customers with a greater increase among 
table of contents leisure transportation market customers resulting from some improvement in the economic conditions in north america and specific customer projects 
gross margin and operating income percentages increased in compared to by one percentage point due to greater leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the higher level of sales in although sales increased by million from to  fixed manufacturing expenses were comparable between years as a  decrease in depreciation expense relating to the timing of historical capital expenditures and retirements offset an increase in other fixed manufacturing expenses associated with the increase in sales 
security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales is primarily due to an increase in order rates across most of our customers resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
gross margin and operating income percentages increased in compared to due to the positive impact of i a million increase in variable contribution primarily as a result of higher sales and improved production efficiencies directly resulting from the higher sales  and ii improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs which increased only  and selling  general and administrative costs which increased only  on higher sales 
furniture components 
furniture components net sales were flat in compared net sales were positively impacted by million in sales relating to the july acquisition of an ergonomics component products business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in sales was fully offset by a decrease in sales of our other ergonomics component products due to a decrease in customer projects associated with government spending 
additionally  we experienced a slight decline in overall demand for ergonomic products due to the somewhat discretionary nature of ergonomic products and the overall challenging economic environment 
gross margin percentage decreased approximately in compared to primarily due to production inefficiencies relating to the facility consolidation and a negative million impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates 
the impact of the acquired ergonomics component business on gross margin percentage for was not significant 
for the and comparative period  furniture components operating income includes i a patent litigation settlement gain of million recognized in  ii patent litigation expenses of million and  in and  respectively  and iii facility consolidation costs of approximately million in excluding the patent litigation settlement gain  patent litigation expenses and facility consolidation costs  operating income percentage decreased percentage points in compared to primarily due to the decrease in gross margin for the comparative period  as noted above 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements regarding the litigation settlement gain and the facility consolidation costs in  respectively 
in july of  we completed the above noted acquisition of an ergonomic component products business for cash consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition is intended to expand our furniture components ergonomics product line 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
furniture components net sales increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in customer order rates across most customers resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
gross margin percentage increased approximately in compared to operating income increased from a loss of million in to income of million in the increases in the gross margin percentage and operating income are primarily the result of i a million increase in variable contribution primarily as a result of higher sales and improved production efficiencies directly resulting from the higher sales  ii improved leverage of fixed manufacturing costs due to the significant increase in sales and continued control of costs  and iii lower selling  general and administrative costs primarily due to a million decrease in litigation expense which was partially offset by limited cost increases in response to the higher sales and the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents marine components 
marine components net sales increased in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was flat over the comparative period 
operating loss percentage improved in compared to primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the higher sales and lower intangible amortization expense due to intangibles that became fully amortized in and the first six months of marine components net sales increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in customer order rates resulting from improved economic conditions in north america 
as a result of the improved labor efficiency and coverage of overhead and fixed cost from the higher sales  gross margin percentage increased approximately from to consequently  the operating loss decreased to million in as compared to a loss of million in outlook sales demand across all of our segments increased during the first quarter of compared to the prior year as conditions in the overall economy improved 
our security products segment continued to see improved demand over the prior year throughout the remainder of the year due to the diversity of the customers that it serves 
however  during the later part of the second quarter and through the remainder of the year  our furniture components segment experienced flat customer demand due to slowing orders in the appliance and office furniture markets as well as a decline in projects driven by government spending 
the furniture components sales were positively impacted by million relating to the business acquired in july which on a pro forma basis had net sales of million in due to the current economic situation  it is uncertain i whether sales growth will return to the furniture components segment over the next several months  ii what the future impact on sales of the acquired business will be or iii the extent that sales will grow in the security products segment during while changes in market demand are not within our control  we are focused on the areas we can impact 
staffing levels are continuously evaluated in relation to sales order rates which may result in headcount adjustments  to the extent possible  to match staffing levels with demand 
we expect our continuous lean manufacturing and cost improvement initiatives  such as the consolidation of our furniture components facilities  to positively impact our productivity and result in a more efficient infrastructure 
additionally  we continue to seek opportunities to gain market share in markets we currently serve  to expand into new markets and to develop new product features in order to mitigate the impact of changes in demand as well as broaden our sales base 
volatility in the costs of commodity raw materials is ongoing 
our primary commodity raw materials are steel  brass  alloyed zinc and stainless steel which together represent approximately of our total cost of goods sold 
compared to  our cost of these raw materials increased in between approximately and 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions as well as occasionally executing larger quantity tactical spot buys of these raw materials  which may result in higher inventory balances for a period of time 
in the event we are unable to offset commodity raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
additionally  significant surcharges may negatively affect our margins as they typically only recover the increased cost of the raw material without adding margin dollars resulting in a lower margin percentage 
consequently  overall operating margins may be negatively affected by commodity raw material cost pressures as is currently the case 
as discussed in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  we have been involved in certain patent infringement litigation  which has in the past resulted in our incurring significant litigation expense 
with the settlement reached during the first quarter of  we do not expect to incur significant litigation expense relating to these patent infringement claims going forward 

table of contents the us dollar weakened in in comparison to the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar  which are the primary currencies of our non us operations 
we expect the non us dollar to continue to weaken during which will likely have a negative impact on our results in comparison to when practical  we will seek to mitigate the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our results by entering into currency hedging contracts 
however  such strategies cannot fully mitigate the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for currency hedging contracts in place at december  liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for capital expenditures  business combinations or buying back shares of our outstanding stock and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness to fund capital expenditures  business combinations or other investment activities 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for the last three years have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to due to lower capital expenditure requirements in recent years as a result of lower customer demand  as well as the timing of certain assets that have become fully depreciated 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the net result of higher operating income in of approximately million primarily as a result of a million litigation settlement gain recognized in and higher security products earnings of million  partially offset by million in facility consolidation costs  lower net cash used by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in higher cash paid for income taxes in of approximately million due to increased earnings  and higher cash paid for interest in of due to the timing of interest payments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million decline in cash provided by operating activities is primarily the net result of 
table of contents improved operating results in of approximately million exclusive of the noncash asset held for sale write downs of  in and  in  and the impact of lower depreciation and amortization expense in of approximately  lower net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of approximately  due to timing of payments  and lower cash paid for interest in of  due to the deferral of interest on our note payable to affiliate until march relative changes in working capital can have a significant effect on cash flows from operating activities 
as shown below  our average days sales outstanding decreased from december  to december  across all of our segments  with the exception of marine components  which does not have a significant amount of receivables 
in absolute terms  accounts receivable decreased by  at december  as compared to december  while fourth quarter sales increased by  as a result  our overall december  days sales outstanding compared to december  is in line with our expectations 
for comparative purposes  we have provided numbers below 
days sales outstanding december  december  december  security products days days days furniture components days days days marine components days days days total days days days as shown below  our average number of days in inventory increased from december  to december  with the exception of marine components 
in addition  inventory increased by million in as compared to  and fourth quarter cost of goods sold also increased by million over the same period in a significant portion of the increase in inventory is attributable to the ergonomics business acquired in the third quarter of the variability in days in inventory among our segments primarily relates to the complexity of the production processes and therefore the length of time it takes to produce end products 
as a result  our overall december  days in inventory compared to december  is in line with our expectations 
for comparative purposes  we have provided numbers below 
days in inventory december  december  december  security products days days days furniture components days days days marine components days days days total days days days investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  capital expenditures have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment  which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
the significant items impacting the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in over net cash used in and are as follows during  
table of contents we received the million principal amount due to us under our promissory note receivable  and we acquired an ergonomic component products business for million  and during  we purchased a promissory note receivable for million 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million compared to capital expenditures of million in  million in  and in our capital expenditures over all three years were limited to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
a significant portion of the increase in expected capital expenditures for relates to the implementation of a new manufacturing and accounting system for our security products and marine components segments 
capital spending for is expected to be funded through cash on hand and cash generated from operations and relates to expenditures required to meet expected customer demand and properly maintain our facilities 
in february  we entered into an unsecured demand promissory note with nl whereby we agreed to loan nl up to million 
we loaned nl a total of million in under the promissory note  which nl subsequently repaid during although the maximum outstanding at any time during the year was million 
no amounts were outstanding as of december  or december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may of  we purchased from nl and one of its subsidiaries  for million in cash  all of their right  title  and interest in a subordinated secured mortgage note receivable dated october  in the original principal amount of million  originally payable to nl and its subsidiary 
we received the full million in principal in october see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts were primarily impacted by the following items during  we repaid million that was outstanding under our credit facility at december   we borrowed million in connection with our acquisition of an ergonomics products business and subsequently repaid million during  and we repaid million in principal payments on our promissory note payable to affiliate  during  we borrowed million under our credit facility  and subsequently repaid million during  and during  we made scheduled payments on our promissory note payable to affiliate of  cash dividends paid totaled million 
per share in each of   and at december   there was approximately million outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
in january  we amended and restated the facility to  among other things  decrease the size of the facility to million 
at december   and based on the amended size of the facility  we could borrow the remaining million without violating any debt covenants 
we were in compliance with all of our amended and restated financial covenants at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents provisions contained in our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our revolving credit facility allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of our revolving credit facility could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
although there are no current expectations to borrow on the revolving credit facility  significantly lower future operating results would likely reduce or eliminate our amount available to borrow and restrict future dividends 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe cash generated from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared for the next twelve months and our long term obligations for the next five years 
to the extent that actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
of the million aggregate cash and cash equivalents at december   million was held by our non us subsidiaries 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable to affiliate long term debt  including interest operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to indebtedness  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amounts shown for interest on indebtedness are based upon the december  interest rates on outstanding indebtedness  and assumes such interest rates remain unchanged through the maturity date of the indebtedness unless the interest rate has changed significantly subsequent to december  in which case the most current rate would be used through the maturity of the indebtedness 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
commitments and contingencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments goodwill our goodwill totaled million at december  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is also evaluated for impairment at other times whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the estimated fair values of our three reporting units are determined using level inputs of a discounted cash flow technique since level or level inputs of market prices are not available at the reporting unit level 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
however  different assumptions and estimates could result in materially different findings which could result in the recognition of a material goodwill impairment 

table of contents no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of our annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill security products and furniture components was substantially in excess of the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we assess property and equipment for impairment only when circumstances as specified in asc  property  plant  and equipment indicate an impairment may exist 
our determination is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset level inputs and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
due to management s approval of a restructuring plan for our furniture components reporting unit in november of  which included moving precision slide production and most of the related furniture and equipment from our byron center  michigan facility to other precision slide manufacturing facilities within our furniture components unit  we evaluated the long lived assets to be moved from our byron center facility 
as of december   we concluded no impairments were present relating to the moved furniture and equipment 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures were to drop significantly below our current expectations  it is reasonably likely we would conclude an impairment was present 
the net asset value of the furniture and equipment that was not moved was not significant and was substantially disposed of as of december  see assets held for sale below regarding the impairment evaluation for the byron center land and building 
as a result of continued losses in the marine components reporting unit  we evaluated the recoverability of the marine components long lived assets during the third quarter of we determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceed the current net asset value and therefore the marine components long lived assets are not impaired 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures were to drop significantly below our current expectations approximately for custom marine and for livorsi marine  it is reasonably likely we would conclude an impairment was present 
at december  the net asset carrying values of custom marine and livorsi marine were million and million  respectively 
no other long lived assets in our other reporting units were tested for impairment during because there were no circumstances indicating an impairment might exist 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 
we reevaluate at the end of each reporting period whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
at the end of march  and 
table of contents based primarily upon changes in our cash management plans  we determined that all of the undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary could no longer be considered permanently reinvested in taiwan 
accordingly  in the first quarter of we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the pre undistributed earnings of our taiwanese subsidiary 
consequently  all of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations are now considered to not be permanently reinvested 
while we may have currently concluded that all of the undistributed earnings are not permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested 
if our prior conclusions change  we would be required to derecognize a previously recognized deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability related to the amount of undistributed earnings considered to be permanently reinvested 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions is nil for each of  and accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change 
assets held for sale our assets held for sale at december   consist of a facility in byron center  michigan  a facility in river grove  illinois and land in neenah  wisconsin 
these three properties primarily land  buildings and building improvements were formerly used in our operations 
in september of  management made the decision to sell the byron center facility see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  at which time the facility met all of the criteria under gaap to be classified as an asset held for sale 
in classifying the byron center facility land and building as held for sale  we concluded that the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell the assets 
in determining the estimated fair value of the land and building  we obtained an independent appraisal 
based on this appraisal  we recognized a write down of  in to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  in due to continued negative local market conditions  we obtained an updated independent appraisal for the river grove facility  the most significant of the remaining two properties 
based on this appraisal  we recognized an additional write down of  in to reduce the carrying value of that asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the write downs as of december  totaled million and are included in corporate operating expense 
the appraisals represent a level input as defined by asc all properties are being actively marketed 
however  due to the current state of the commercial real estate market  we can not be certain of the timing of the disposition of the assets 
if we continue to experience difficulty in disposing of the assets at or above their carrying value  we may have to record additional write downs of the assets in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  all of our outstanding indebtedness was comprised of variable rate instruments 
the following table presents principal amounts  interest rates and fair value for our outstanding indebtedness at december  and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in thousands december  variable rate indebtedness promissory note to timet revolving credit facility total december  variable rate indebtedness promissory note to timet revolving credit facility total all of our debt is at variable interest rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates 
as of december  the analysis indicated that such rate movements would not have a material effect on our financial results from operations or cash flows 
however  actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a substantial portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most materials  labor and other production costs for these non us operations are primarily denominated in local currencies 
as a result  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as previously noted  certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  we periodically enter into forward currency contracts to mitigate the financial statement impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
at december   we held a series of 
table of contents contracts to exchange an aggregate of us million for an equivalent value of canadian dollars at exchange rates ranging from cdn 
to cdn 
per us dollar 
these contracts qualified for hedge accounting and mature through december the exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar at december  the estimated fair value of the contracts was a liability of approximately  at december  we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  raw materials 
we will occasionally enter into short term commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
we do not have long term supply agreements for our raw material requirements because either we believe the risk of unavailability of those raw materials is low and we believe the the downside risk of price volatility to be too great or because long term supply agreements for those materials are generally not available 
we do not engage in commodity raw material hedging programs 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
