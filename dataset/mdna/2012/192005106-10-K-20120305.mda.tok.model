table of contents part i item business company overview we are a producer of custom industrial enzymes 
our products enable novel  sustainable processes for the manufacture of biofuels  bio based chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients 
we are developing our flagship codexyme cellulase enzymes to convert non food plant material  which we call cellulosic biomass  into affordable sugars  which can then be converted into renewable fuels and chemicals 
we have been developing these cellulase enzymes with royal dutch shell plc  or shell  since for applications in the biofuels markets 
we intend to market codexyme cellulase enzymes to chemicals manufacturers worldwide 
we are also developing our own manufacturing processes for certain specialty and commodity bio based chemicals  which we intend to commercialize with strategic partners 
the first of these products is codexol detergent alcohols 
detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  which are key  active cleaning ingredients in consumer products such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
we have commercialized our technology  products and services in the pharmaceuticals market 
there are currently over pharmaceutical firms using our technology  products and services in their manufacturing process development  including in the production of some of the world s bestselling and fastest growing drugs 
we create our products by applying our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform which introduces genetic mutations into microorganisms  giving rise to changes in the enzymes which they produce 
once we identify potentially beneficial mutations  we test combinations of these mutations until we have created variant enzymes that exhibit marketable performance characteristics superior to competitive products 
this process allows us to make continuous  efficient improvements to the performance of our enzymes 
codexyme cellulase enzymes many of the fuels and chemicals that make modern  everyday life possible are derived from non renewable petroleum resources 
codexyme cellulase enzymes enable these same fuels and chemicals to be made from renewable resources  such as cellulosic biomass 
fuels and chemicals produced from these types of materials and wastes are known as second generation  next generation  or cellulosic products 
today  cellulosic fuels and chemicals are not manufactured at commercial scale because their unit production economics have not yet been shown to be competitive with incumbent petroleum based fuels and chemicals 
we believe codexyme cellulase enzymes will be a key factor in driving competitive production economics for cellulosic fuels and chemicals  thereby enabling their integration into global commodity markets and creating a sugar economy 
codexyme cellulase enzymes function by transforming cellulosic biomass into sugars  a process known as saccharification 
the resulting sugars from saccharification can be converted into fuels and chemicals through fermentation 
our goal is to make codexyme cellulase enzymes the leader in the cellulase enzyme category 
our partnership driven commercialization strategy for codexyme cellulase enzymes is designed to leverage our primary competitive strength  which we believe is our ability to optimize the performance of codexyme cellulase enzymes rapidly for varying feedstocks and process conditions 
for the commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes in the fuels market  we are collaborating jointly with shell and iogen energy corporation  or iogen  for the production of cellulosic ethanol from wheat straw and corn stover feedstocks 
we have agreed to work exclusively with shell in the production of cellulosic biofuels until november shell is one of the world s largest distributors of biofuels  with about billion gallons billion liters distributed in 
table of contents for the commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes in the chemicals market  our strategy is to collaborate with leading technology partners and customers to develop a proprietary  cost effective saccharification process using our cellulase enzymes 
for example  we are collaborating with chemtex  a subsidiary of gruppo mossi ghisolfi  on the saccharification of various forms of cellulosic biomass for use in the production of codexol detergent alcohols 
our bio based chemicals we are also developing microorganisms that produce chemicals from cellulosic sugars 
these microorganisms function as mini fermentation factories that convert sugars into specialty or commodity chemicals 
our first chemical development initiative is our bio based codexol detergent alcohols program 
detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  an active ingredient in consumer products  such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
the annual global market for detergent alcohols is approximately billion  which represents approximately million metric tons with an average selling price  or asp  of approximately  per ton today 
major consumer products companies such as procter gamble  unilever and henkel purchase or produce a majority of the surfactants derived from detergent alcohols 
we plan to sell codexol detergent alcohols as a drop in substitute for over of the detergent alcohols market 
currently  detergent alcohols are manufactured using two alternative processes 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using vegetable oils  such as palm  kernel and coconut oils  is known as the oleochemical production route 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using ethylene is known as the petrochemical production route 
we believe that our codexol detergent alcohols process  by using cellulosic sugars  has the potential to offer attractive production economics compared to incumbent oleochemical and petrochemical production routes 
we are developing our fully integrated cellulosic codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing process  from feedstock to product  in collaboration with chemtex 
we believe that our codexol detergent alcohols process may be used with a wide variety of cellulosic biomass  including sugarcane bagasse  wheat straw  corn stover and various energy crops such as arundo donax 
we believe that this process has the potential to decrease the manufacturing costs of codexol detergent alcohols below current incumbent production costs 
we also believe that in comparison to using oleochemical and petrochemical production routes  the raw materials of which raise concerns regarding deforestation  climate change and other environmental impacts  using codexol detergent alcohols in their manufacturing process would better enable major consumer products companies to achieve their sustainability and corporate social responsibility goals 
one example of such corporate social responsibility goal is the sustainable living plan announced by unilever  under which unilever is committed to sourcing of its agricultural raw materials sustainably by we intend to bring this process to commercial scale by establishing manufacturing partnerships or by directly licensing our process technology to manufacturers 
we are also identifying promising biological routes for the production of other specialty and commodity chemicals from cellulosic sugars 
we expect to partner with global chemicals manufacturing companies and consumer goods companies to develop and commercialize these potential new products 
our pharmaceutical enzymes and intermediates we market and sell enzymes  development services and screening tools that enable novel manufacturing processes for active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and their precursor pharmaceutical intermediates 
we also market and sell pharmaceutical intermediates that are manufactured using our custom enzymes 
our customers include several of the largest global pharmaceutical companies 

table of contents our pharmaceutical products and services enable novel manufacturing processes that lower production costs and reduce capital intensity 
these products and services provide numerous benefits to our customers  including reducing the use of raw materials and intermediate products  improving product yield  using water as a primary solvent  performing reactions at or near room temperature and pressure  eliminating the need for certain costly manufacturing equipment  reducing energy requirements  and reducing the need for late stage purification steps 
we sell our products and services to both the generic and on patent pharmaceutical end markets 
our products and services have been adopted at various points of the pharmaceutical product lifecycle  from early stage clinical testing to post launch commercialization 
our strategy become the leading supplier of cellulase enzymes 
we intend to become a leading supplier of cellulase enzymes for manufacturers of second generation biofuels and bio based chemicals globally 
we expect that our customers will be able to use our codexyme cellulase enzymes to convert various cellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars efficiently and economically 
develop and commercialize our technology in a capital light partnership model 
our business model leverages our collaborators engineering  manufacturing and commercial expertise  their distribution infrastructure and their ability to fund commercial scale production facilities 
for instance  if shell commercializes biofuels using our technology  such as codexyme cellulase enzymes  shell  or other parties selected by shell  would design and build the commercial scale fuel production facilities and distribute the fuel to market 
in the pharmaceuticals market  our supply relationship with contract manufacturing organizations  like arch pharmalabs limited  or arch  enables us to bring intermediates and or apis for branded pharmaceutical products to market with very limited additional capital 
continue growing our pharmaceutical business 
we intend to pursue new collaborations in the pharmaceutical industry to integrate our products and services more deeply into drug development and manufacturing processes for clinical stage and commercially approved pharmaceutical products 
as part of that effort  we will continue to market our codex biocatalyst panels and our codex biocatalyst kits aggressively to pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the capabilities of our technology platform 
develop chemicals from cellulosic sugars 
we intend to develop chemicals from cellulosic sugars instead of petroleum or other non renewable feedstocks 
our first chemical development initiative is our bio based codexol detergent alcohols program  which we are developing in collaboration with chemtex 
we are also identifying promising biological routes for the production of other specialty and commodity chemicals from cellulosic sugars 
our codexyme cellulase enzyme business industry overview the global economy is heavily dependent on petroleum 
many of the fuels and chemicals that are used throughout the world are derived from non renewable petroleum and concerns about the long term supply of petroleum and its price volatility have increased the desire to find renewable alternatives to this limited commodity 
many fuels and chemicals manufactures are looking for alternatives to non renewable petroleum  including cellulosic biomass  as a feedstock for their products 

table of contents fuels and chemicals derived from corn starch  sugar cane or plant oils are called first generation products and those derived from cellulosic biomass such as corn stover  wheat straw and sugar cane bagasse are known as second generation  next generation or cellulosic products 
in order to produce a cellulosic product successfully  a manufacturer must first pretreat the cellulosic biomass and then introduce cellulase enzymes into the manufacturing process 
together  these steps work to break down the cellulose and hemicellulose found in the cell walls of the cellulosic biomass into sugars 
this process is commonly referred to as saccharification 
these sugars can then be converted into biofuels and chemicals through fermentation 
producing second generation fuels and chemicals is a more complicated process than producing first generation products 
as a result  most biofuel and bio based chemical manufacturers have chosen to develop and commercialize first generation products 
sources of cellulosic biomass vary greatly by plant species and geographic region 
one of the challenges for manufacturing cellulosic products is the need for technology that can convert the vast array of cellulosic biomass found throughout the world into fermentable sugars 
solving this challenge requires cellulosic biofuels and chemicals manufacturers to develop innovative  robust cellulase enzymes that have greater product yield  are more cost effective  and react quickly and continually under industrial conditions 
we do not believe that anyone has successfully accomplished this goal cost effectively and at commercial scale 
our solution codexyme cellulase enzymes we believe that codexyme cellulase enzymes will enable the production of cellulosic fuels and bio based chemicals cost effectively and at commercial scale 
we believe codexyme cellulase enzymes will be a key factor in driving competitive production economics for cellulosic fuels and chemicals  thereby enabling their integration into global commodity markets 
codexyme cellulase enzymes have the potential to convert a wide variety of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars  an important feature because the cellulosic biomass that we expect will be used to produce cellulosic products is highly variable from region to region and can change over time 
to optimize the local and seasonal conversion of cellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars  we expect to customize our cellulase enzymes so that products manufacturers can select and customize the enzymes that they use at each production facility 
this technical innovation may ultimately make our sugar platform feedstock agnostic 
for example  codexyme cellulase enzymes convert both sugar cane bagasse and wheat straw to fermentable sugars 
in addition  we licensed a commercial scale enzyme production system from dyadic international  inc  or dyadic  in that we expect will enable the cost effective production of codexyme cellulase enzymes 
we believe that the combination of our high performing codexyme cellulase enzymes and the ability to produce these cellulase enzymes cost effectively at commercial scale  will enable us to develop a scalable  global sugar platform that will provide us and our customers a competitive advantage in the cellulosic products market 
for the commercialization of our codexyme cellulase enzymes products in the fuels market  we are collaborating jointly with shell and iogen for the production of ethanol from wheat straw and corn stover 
we have also agreed to work with shell  one of the world s largest distributors of biofuels  exclusively in the production of cellulosic biofuels 
since  we have been engaged with shell in a research and development collaboration under which we are developing enzymes and microorganisms for use in producing cellulosic biofuels 
under our collaboration with shell  shell has the right  but not the obligation  to commercialize any technology that we develop in this shell program 
if shell commercializes our biofuels technology  we will collect a royalty for every gallon of fuel that shell produces using our technology 
if shell chooses to commercialize any biofuels products developed through our collaboration  we believe that the combination of our technology platform with shell s proven product development capabilities and resources could enable a biofuels solution that extends from the conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels to delivery and distribution of biofuels to consumers at the pump 
for the commercialization of our codexyme cellulase enzymes in the bio based chemicals market  our strategy is to collaborate with leading technology partners and customers to develop novel  cost effective saccharification processes using our enzymes 
for example  we are collaborating with chemtex  a subsidiary of gruppo mossi ghisolfi  on the saccharification of various types of cellulosic biomass for use in the production of codexol detergent alcohols 

table of contents our chemicals business industry overview detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  a key  active cleaning ingredient in consumer products such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate are two such common surfactants 
the annual global market for detergent alcohols is approximately billion  which represents approximately million metric tons with an asp of approximately  per ton 
major consumer products companies  such as procter gamble  unilever and henkel  purchase or produce a majority of the surfactants made from detergent alcohols 
currently  detergent alcohols are manufactured using two alternative processes 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using vegetable oils  such as palm  kernel and coconut oils  is known as the oleochemical production route 
the process of manufacturing detergent alcohols using ethylene is known as the petrochemical production route 
the production economics of traditional detergent alcohol manufacturing routes are primarily based on the market prices of their respective feedstocks 
both ethylene and palm kernel oil prices have risen considerably in recent years  leading to a significant rise in the price of detergent alcohols 
between and  global detergent alcohol prices rose from  per ton to over  per ton  and in early  prices higher than approximately  per ton were observed for the first time in recent history before returning back to the  per ton range 
in addition to price volatility  consumer products companies face sustainability and corporate social responsibility issues with traditional detergent alcohols 
the oleochemical route  which is also referred to as the production route  which as of accounted for over two thirds of global detergent alcohol production  has led to concerns of deforestation due to the rapid expansion of palm oil plantations to meet growing demand 
the petrochemical route  which is also referred to as the synthetic route  uses petroleum based ethylene manufacturing processes that are also considered unsustainable 
many major consumer products companies today have adopted corporate social responsibility platforms in which they have pledged to their customers and stockholders that they will use sustainable  socially responsible materials in their commercial products 
for example unilever s sustainable living plan sets specific goals including halving the environmental footprint of the company s products and sourcing of the company s agricultural raw materials sustainably 
procter gamble s environmental sustainability vision includes using renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging  and designing products that appeal to customers while maximizing conservation of resources 
our solution codexol detergent alcohols codexol detergent alcohols can act as a drop in substitute for over of the estimated billion detergent alcohol market 
we expect that codexol detergent alcohols will offer advantages in price volatility  production economics and sustainability when compared to traditional detergent alcohols 
we are developing our codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing process  from feedstock to end product  in collaboration with chemtex 
chemtex has licensed to us  on an exclusive basis in the field of detergent alcohols  its proesa pretreatment technology  which we are integrating with codexyme cellulase enzymes to create fermentable sugars 
our proprietary microorganism will then convert these sugars into codexol detergent alcohols 
we have agreed to use the proesa pretreatment technology exclusively to produce codexol detergent alcohols 
similarly  chemtex has agreed to work exclusively with us in the production of cellulosic detergent alcohols 
we expect that chemtex will pilot this manufacturing process using codexyme cellulase enzymes and their proesa pretreatment technology in chemtex will provide engineering services for the design and construction of our commercial facilities for the production of codexol detergent alcohols and we will market products resulting from the collaboration 

table of contents codexol detergent alcohols are manufactured using a process which is amenable to various types of cellulosic biomass  including sugarcane bagasse  wheat straw  corn stover and various energy crops such as arundo donax 
we believe that this process has the potential to lower codexol detergent alcohols manufacturing costs and make them less volatile than current incumbent manufacturing costs 
our vision is to engage in long term agricultural supply contracts for the cellulosic biomass needed to manufacture codexol detergent alcohols 
we intend to bring this process to commercial scale by establishing manufacturing partnerships or by directly licensing our process technology to manufacturers 
additionally  codexol detergent alcohols are better aligned with the sustainability and corporate social responsibility goals of major consumer products companies  like unilever and procter gamble  since it is sourced from sustainable and renewable cellulosic biomass 
other bio based chemicals opportunities we are also identifying promising biological routes for the production of other specialty and commodity chemicals from sugars 
we expect to partner with global chemical manufacturing companies and consumer goods companies to develop and commercialize these potential new products 
there are significant market opportunities in the chemical industry for companies that can help reduce or eliminate petroleum dependency  as well as costly and wasteful manufacturing processes 
our pharmaceutical business our opportunity in the pharmaceutical market the pharmaceutical industry continues to represent a significant market opportunity for us 
pharmaceutical companies are now under significant competitive pressure both to reduce costs and to increase the speed to market for their products 
to meet these pressures  pharmaceutical companies seek manufacturing processes for their new and existing drugs that reduce overall costs  simplify production and increase efficiency and product yield  while not affecting drug safety and efficacy 
in addition  for products whose patents have expired  the importance of cost reduction is even higher  as the pharmaceutical manufacturers that developed those patent protected drugs  known as innovators  compete with generics manufacturers 
the pharmaceutical product lifecycle begins with the discovery of new chemical entities and continues through preclinical and clinical development  product launch and  ultimately  patent expiration and the transition from branded to generic products 
as innovators develop  produce and then market products  manufacturing priorities and processes evolve 
historically  innovators have focused on production cost reduction in the later stages of clinical development and have been reluctant to make process changes after a product has been launched 
however  as pressures to reduce costs have increased  innovators have pursued cost reduction measures much earlier in the pharmaceutical product lifecycle and are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve their operating margins  including making manufacturing process changes for marketed products after the products have been launched if these changes can result in significant cost reductions 
as a result  innovators are investing in new technologies to improve their manufacturing productivity and efficiency or outsourcing the manufacture of their intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis 
our solution for the pharmaceutical market our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform enables us to deliver solutions to our customers in the pharmaceutical market by developing and delivering optimized enzymes that perform chemical transformations at a lower cost and improve the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing processes 
we provide value throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle 
our pharmaceutical products and services allow us to provide benefits to our customers in a number of ways  including reducing the use of raw materials and intermediate products  
table of contents improving product yield  using water as a primary solvent  performing reactions at or near room temperature and pressure  eliminating the need for certain costly manufacturing equipment  reducing energy requirements  reducing the need for late stage purification steps  eliminating multiple steps in the manufacturing process  and eliminating hazardous inputs and harmful emission by products 
early in the product lifecycle  customers can use our products and services to achieve speed to market and to reduce manufacturing costs 
if an innovator incorporates our products or processes into an fda approved product  we expect the innovator to continue to use these products or processes for the patent life of the approved drug 
after a product is launched  customers also use our products and services to reduce manufacturing costs 
at this stage  changes in the manufacturing process originally approved by the fda may require additional review 
typically  pharmaceutical companies will only seek fda approval for a manufacturing change if there are substantial cost savings associated with the change 
we believe that the cost savings associated with our products may lead our customers to change their manufacturing processes for approved products and  if necessary  seek fda approval of the new processes which incorporate our enzymes 
moreover  we believe these cost savings are attractive to generics manufacturers  who compete primarily on price 
products and services codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
we sell codex biocatalyst panels and kits to customers who are engaged in both drug development and the marketing of approved drugs to allow them to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes for their drug candidates and their marketed products 
codex biocatalyst panels are tools that provide genetically diverse variants of our proprietary enzymes  which allow our customers to determine whether an enzyme produces a desired activity that is applicable to a particular process 
codex biocatalyst kits provide subsets of the panel enzymes in individual vials for the same purpose 
for compounds that are in development  codex biocatalyst panels and kits allow innovators to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes rapidly and inexpensively for many of their drug candidates in house  without the risks of disclosing the composition of their proprietary molecules before they have received patent protection  and generate data that we can use to optimize enzymes rapidly for a particular reaction  if necessary  reducing the time required to generate a manufacturing process capable of supporting clinical trials with inexpensively produced  pure drugs 
we believe that codex biocatalyst panels and kits have helped us build early and broad awareness of the power and utility of our technology platform  and will increasingly lead to sales of our enzymes and enzyme optimization services  as well as intermediates and apis made using our enzymes 
over customers  including leading pharmaceutical companies such as f 
hoffman la roche ltd  glaxosmithkline plc  merck  novartis and pfizer  have used our panels and kits 
if our customers incorporate an enzymatic manufacturing process early in a product s lifecycle  they can reduce their manufacturing costs throughout that lifecycle  while we  in turn  could realize a long term revenue stream resulting from the use of our enzymes during that time 
in addition  codex biocatalyst panels and kits are increasingly used by our customers to evaluate the feasibility of changing the manufacturing process for their marketed products to an enzyme enabled process 

table of contents enzyme screening services 
if a customer prefers  rather than subscribing to our codex biocatalyst panels or kits to use for their own screening  they can send us their materials to test against our existing libraries of enzymes 
if we detect desired activity in a specific enzyme  we can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform optimization services to improve the performance of the enzyme 
our screening services allow innovators to screen and identify possible enzymatic manufacturing processes rapidly and inexpensively through access to our extensive enzyme libraries  and generate data that we can use to optimize enzymes rapidly for a particular reaction  if necessary  reducing the time required to generate a manufacturing process capable of supporting the customers particular needs  ranging from small quantities for clinical trials to full commercial production  in all cases providing inexpensively produced  pure drugs 
we have provided screening services to numerous innovator and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers 
enzyme optimization services 
we work with our customers throughout the pharmaceutical product lifecycle to customize enzymes  resulting in optimized enzymes that have been evolved specifically to perform a desired process according to a highly selective set of specifications 
our enzyme optimization services allow innovators to improve the manufacturing process as their drug candidates progress through preclinical and clinical development  in some cases deferring or reducing the need for significant manufacturing investment until the likelihood of commercial success is more certain  and enable manufacturing processes that are highly efficient  inexpensive  require relatively little energy  reduce the need for hazardous reagents and reduce waste 
for example  our activities with pfizer have included developing an optimized enzymatic manufacturing process for a key intermediate that eliminates three chemical steps from the conventional chemical manufacturing process 
enzymes 
we supply varying quantities of our enzymes to pharmaceutical companies  from small to moderate quantities while they are optimizing their production processes  to larger quantities during later stage clinical development and commercial scale drug production 
our enzymes enable innovators to manufacture products more efficiently during preclinical and clinical development using optimized enzymatic processes  with relatively low investment  eliminate the need for innovators to invest in the development of complex chemical synthesis routes during the development stage  allow innovators to achieve higher product purity during the development stage prior to investing in expensive late stage clinical trials  reduce the risk of adverse effects arising from product impurities  allow the removal of entire steps from synthetic chemical production routes during commercial scale production  reducing raw material costs  energy requirements and the need for capital expenditures  and decrease the manufacturing costs for our customers 
for instance  as a part of our ongoing collaboration with merck  we have developed an enzyme for use in a new manufacturing process for sitagliptin  the api in merck s pharmaceutical product januvia 
januvia is merck s first in class medication for the treatment of type ii diabetes 
we have also entered into agreements 
table of contents with several leading contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos  including royal dsm nv  or dsm  dishman pharmaceuticals and chemicals  ltd  and ampac  under which these cmos can use our enzymes in their manufacturing processes 
intermediates and apis 
we can supply our customers with intermediates and apis made using our enzymes throughout the drug lifecycle 
our supply of intermediates has the following uses and benefits lowers capital investment for innovators through outsourcing of manufacturing  and provides a source of less expensive  more pure products to innovator and generics manufacturers 
we are currently supplying pfizer with an intermediate in the manufacture of lipitor  a cholesterol lowering drug that is the world s best selling prescription drug 
we also developed a key intermediate for boceprevir  which is merck s hepatitis c drug 
we have also developed enzymes for use in the manufacture of certain generic intermediates and apis by various companies  including arch and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  or teva 
in addition  we market several intermediates and apis for the generic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products for sale in markets where innovators have not sought patent protection for their products and intend to sell these same intermediates and apis for use in markets where innovators have sought patent protection when the patent protection for each product expires 
our ethanol fermentation business first generation ethanol we are collaborating with our largest stockholder  ra zen energia participa es sa  or ra zen  to improve ra zen s current first generation process for manufacturing ethanol from sugarcane 
ra zen  a billion brazil based joint venture between shell and cosan sa ind stria e com rcio  or cosan  has annual production capacity of over billion liters of ethanol  and is the world s largest producer of ethanol from sugar cane  with million gallons produced in as part of this collaboration  we are developing enhanced yeasts that may improve ra zen s ethanol production yield 
we are also developing enzymes that may be used to increase the efficiency of the first generation ethanol process 
cellulosic ethanol the goal of our cellulosic ethanol program  as part of our broader biofuels collaboration with shell and iogen  is to develop specialized commercial yeasts that optimally produce high levels of ethanol from cellulose derived sugars 
cellulosic biomass produces a mix of several types of sugars  including glucose  xylose and arabinose 
glucose is the main type of sugar in the mix and it is readily converted to ethanol by fermentation using commercial yeast 
xylose is another significant component of the mix but is not converted to ethanol by the yeast currently used in today s first generation ethanol production 
therefore  it is important to develop yeast that can rapidly convert not only glucose but also xylose and other sugars into ethanol 
the yeast that we developed must be sufficiently robust to be able to produce ethanol in the presence of a variety of chemical compounds that have been shown to inhibit yeast activity 
using a number of our core technologies we have developed a yeast strain that rapidly converts more of these sugars to ethanol under a range of industrial conditions  which should result in greater ethanol production and lower capital and ethanol production costs 
additional bioindustrial opportunities we believe that our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform  together with the knowledge and experience gained from our efforts in our cellulase enzyme and chemicals programs and in the 
table of contents pharmaceutical market  will allow us to capitalize on opportunities in other bioindustrial markets 
one such opportunity that we have identified is in the carbon management market  where we are seeking to apply our technology platform to the management of carbon dioxide emissions from stationary point sources such as coal fired power plants 
we believe our biocatalysts have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of carbon capture processes in harsh industrial conditions 
in june  we received a million arpa e recovery act program grant from the us department of energy for development of innovative technology to remove carbon dioxide from coal fired power plant emissions 
this grant supports our development of biocatalysts for more efficient carbon capture from these plants 
the grant term expires in july strategic collaborations our strategic collaborations allow us to develop our products while operating our business with maximum capital efficiency 
by collaborating with companies such as shell and arch  we are able to leverage both our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform and our collaborators strengths in production and distribution 
this allows us to focus our capital on key areas such as research and development 
shell and other biofuels partners we collaborate with shell  to develop commercially viable fuels from cellulosic biomass 
if shell chooses to commercialize any biofuels products developed through our collaboration  we believe that the combination of our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform with shell s proven project development capabilities and resources could enable a biofuels solution  from converting cellulosic biomass into biofuels that extends to delivering and distributing refined biofuels to consumers at the pump 
in november  we entered into a research agreement with shell 
after exceeding targets related to biocatalyst performance under the research agreement  we entered into a new research and development collaboration under a five year amended and restated collaborative research agreement in november  which was amended further in march and february under the terms of the amended and restated collaborative research agreement  we agreed to use our proprietary technology platform to discover and develop enzymes and microorganisms for use in converting cellulosic biomass into biofuels and related products 
we received an up front payment of million in upon signing the amended and restated collaborative research agreement 
we have agreed to work exclusively with shell until november to convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars that are used in the production of fuels and related products and to convert these sugars into fuels and related products 
however  shell is not required to work exclusively with us  and could develop or pursue alternative technologies that it decides to use for commercialization purposes instead of any technology developed under our collaborative research agreement 
even if shell decides to commercialize products based on our technologies  they have no obligation to purchase their enzymes or microorganisms from us 
the up front fee is refundable under certain conditions  such as a change in control in which we are acquired by a competitor of shell 
this refundability lapses ratably on a straight line basis over a five year period which started in november and which ends in november in march  we agreed to devote to the research and development collaboration full time employee equivalents  or ftes  which shell funded at an annual base rate per fte of  for ftes located in the united states  and  for ftes located in hungary 
these annual base rates per fte have been subject to annual adjustments based on changes in the consumer price index for the united states and hungary for each subsequent year of the collaboration 
shell has the right to reduce the number of funded ftes  with any one reduction not to exceed funded ftes  following advance written notice 
the required notice period ranges from to days 
following any such reduction  shell is subject to a standstill period of between and days during which period shell cannot provide notice of any further fte reductions

arch we are collaborating with arch of mumbai  india in the manufacture and sale of certain specified apis  and intermediates used in the manufacture of apis  such as the api in lipitor  that are produced using enzymes that we supply to arch 
arch has extensive expertise in chemical process development and scale up  and is a leading producer of intermediates and generic apis in india 
we have had contractual arrangements with arch since august in february  we consolidated and modified certain of the contractual terms in our agreements with arch by simultaneously terminating all of our existing agreements with arch  other than the master services agreement with arch entered into as of august   and entered into two new agreements with arch 
these new agreements are a product supply agreement and an enzyme and product supply agreement  which we refer to as the arch agreements

technology we engineer custom industrial enzymes and microorganisms  which we sometimes refer to as biocatalysts 
in simple terms  our enzymes and microorganisms initiate or accelerate chemical reactions 
we use our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform  which includes enzyme engineering  metabolic pathway engineering and fermentation microbe improvement  to develop novel enzymes and microorganisms that enable industrial biocatalytic reactions and fermentations 
our technology platform has enabled commercially viable products and processes for the manufacture of pharmaceutical intermediates  and we apply our technology platform to develop codexyme cellulase enzymes  codexol detergent alcohols and other bio based chemicals 
our approach to developing commercially viable biocatalytic processes begins by conceptually designing the most cost effective and practical manufacturing process for a targeted product 
we then develop optimized biocatalysts to enable that process design  using our directed evolution technology  including screening and validating biocatalysts under relevant conditions 
typical design criteria include stability in the desired reaction conditions  biocatalyst activity and productivity yield  ease of product isolation  product purity and cost 
alternative approaches to biocatalytic process development typically involve designing and engineering the biocatalytic processes around shortcomings of available biocatalysts  including  for example  biocatalyst immobilization for stability and or reuse  special equipment and costly product isolation and purification methods 
we circumvent the need for these types of costly process design features by optimizing the biocatalyst for fitness in the desired process environment 
as a result  we enable and develop cost efficient processes that typically are relatively simple to run in conventional manufacturing equipment 
this also allows for the efficient technical transfer of our process to our manufacturing partners 
the successful embodiment of codeevolver directed evolution technology platform in commercial manufacturing processes requires well integrated expertise in a number of technical disciplines 
in addition to those directly involved in practicing our directed evolution technologies  such as molecular biology  enzymology  microbiology  cellular engineering  metabolic engineering  bioinformatics  biochemistry  and high throughput analytical chemistry  our process development projects also involve integrated expertise in organic chemistry  chemical process development  chemical engineering  fermentation process development  and fermentation engineering 
our tightly integrated  multi disciplinary approach to biocatalyst and process development is a critical success factor for our company 
enzyme optimization overview the enzyme optimization process starts by identifying genes that code for enzymes known to have the general type of catalytic reactivity for a desired chemical reaction 
typically  we identify gene sequences in published databases and then synthesize candidate genes having those sequences 
using a variety of biotechnology tools  we diversify these genes by introducing mutations  giving rise to changes in the enzymes for which they encode 
the methods for diversifying these genes  and types of diversity being tested  often vary over the course of a enzyme optimization program 
for finding initial diversity  methods typically include random mutagenesis and site directed included structure guided mutagenesis 
we also test mutational variations that distinguish related enzymes among different organisms 
once we have identified potentially beneficial mutations  we test combinations of these mutations in libraries made using our proprietary gene recombination methodologies  gene shuffling and multiplexed gene soeing  or splicing by overlap extension 

table of contents with our proprietary gene shuffling methodology  we generate libraries of genes that have random combinations of the mutations we are testing 
the pool of genes is used to transform host cells  which entails introducing the various genes  one each  into host cells 
these cells are then segregated and grown into colonies 
cells from individual colonies are cultured in high throughput to produce the enzyme encoded by the shuffled gene in those cells 
the enzymes are then screened in high throughput using test conditions relevant to the desired process 
the screening results identify individual shuffled genes that produce improved enzymes having combinations of beneficial mutations and weed out enzymes having detrimental ones 
using different test conditions and or different analytical methods  we can identify variant enzymes that exhibit various improved performance characteristics  such as stability  activity and selectivity  under conditions relevant to the desired chemical process 
in the next step in our optimization process  we use our proprietary software tool  prosar  to analyze protein sequence activity relationships 
prosar aids in identifying specific gene and enzyme mutations that are beneficial  neutral or detrimental with respect to the desired performance characteristics 
earlier directed evolution methods did not separately evaluate individual mutations in libraries of variants which carry multiple mutations  where beneficial and detrimental performance characteristics may be mixed in an individual gene or enzyme 
capitalizing on the advent of inexpensive gene sequencing  we are able to determine which particular mutations are present in the genes and proteins we have screened 
our prosar bioinformatics software relates the screening results to the mutations and ranks the individual mutations with regard to their degree of benefit or detriment  relative to whichever process parameter s the screening tested 
using that information  we can bias the pool of mutational diversity in the next iteration to further the accumulation of beneficial diversity and cancel out detrimental diversity in the individual genes in the resulting shuffled library 
the prosar results also help us develop ideas about new diversity to test 
prosar  combined with efficient gene synthesis and high quality library generation methods  has led to a significant increase in the efficiency and speed of enzyme improvement and optimization 
in another step of our optimization process  we take the best variants we have identified and prepare enough of each to test in the desired chemical process at laboratory scale  for in process confirmation 
this optimization routine is done iteratively  typically adding new diversity to the pool in each iteration 
the gene that codes for the best performing enzyme in one iteration is used as the starting gene for the next iteration of shuffling and screening 
as the enzymes improve over these iterations  the screening conditions are made increasingly more stringent 
in this way  enzymes are rapidly optimized until all in process performance requirements have been achieved and the economic objectives for the desired process have been met 
multiplexed gene soeing is our proprietary methodology for rapidly generating gene variants 
using multiplexed gene soeing  we rapidly generate collections of individual gene variants that have predetermined  as opposed to random  combinations of mutations we are testing 
it is based on a biotechnology technique  which we refer to as soeing  generally used to make a hybrid  or spliced  gene from fragments of two genes and or to introduce a specific mutation into a splice between fragments of one gene 
we have automated the process to make robotically  in parallel  one hundred to several hundred variants  each with a predetermined combination of the mutations we are testing 
the variants are introduced into host cells  and the encoded enzyme is produced and screened in high throughput  as described above 
using multiplexed gene soeing  we can test many mutations and combinations thereof in parallel  and because the mutation incorporation is controlled and predetermined before screening  as opposed to random incorporation and selection after screening  the resulting data set can be more optimal for prosar analysis 
we believe using multiplexed gene soeing to survey many mutations quickly  followed by prosar driven shuffling of beneficial mutations  is a particularly effective approach  providing rapid gains in enzyme performance 

table of contents codex biocatalyst panels and kits codex biocatalyst panels were initially developed to speed our own internal process for identifying enzymes with desired characteristics for further optimization 
each codex biocatalyst panel is comprised of variants of one or more enzymes that catalyze one type of a generally useful chemical reaction 
we assemble  on one or more multi well sample plates  variants of a parent enzyme that we pre optimize for stability in industrial chemical processes and for ready manufacturability 
the variants are diversified to react to a variety of chemical structures that are susceptible to that type of chemical reaction 
either we or our innovator pharmaceutical customers use the codex biocatalyst panels to screen a new chemical structure against the assembled variants to identify variants that react with the new chemical structure rapidly 
for some new structures  a variant on the panel could enable production of the desired product 
we can also analyze the data from the panel screen using prosar to identify the mutations that are beneficial for the reaction of the new structure and further optimize the enzyme as needed using the enzyme optimization techniques described above 
in cases where a customer wishes to screen a proprietary new chemical structure itself  we can produce a custom panel of new variants on a sample plate produced by multiplexed gene soeing 
in our biofuels research and development collaboration with shell  we are developing a library of cellulases that have the potential to convert a wide variety of cellulosic biomass sources into fermentable sugars 
the cellulosic biomass that we expect will be used to produce advanced biofuels is highly variable from region to region and can change over time 
to optimize the local and seasonal conversion of cellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars  we expect to customize the cellulases that shell uses at each advanced biofuel production facility 
this technical innovation may ultimately make our sugar platform feedstock agnostic 
in  we launched codex screening kits as an alternative format to provide our enzymes to pharmaceutical development laboratories that are not equipped to use multi well sample plates 
the enzymes are instead individually provided in vials for the researchers to sample 
as of december   codex screening kits were in use or evaluation in manufacturing process development at over pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
microbe optimization using gene optimization for fermentation microbes  we enhance metabolic pathways by using gene optimization to improve the production and or productivity of one or more enzymes in a series of in vivo reactions that make a desired product 
we optimize the gene enzyme as described above using either in vitro or in vivo screening 
for fermentation applications  the microbes containing the improved gene s are directly evaluated in laboratory scale fermenters 
the metabolic pathway may naturally exist in the microbe  but productivity and or selectivity improvements are needed to produce more of the desired natural product and or less of an undesired by product economically 
we can also introduce a new metabolic pathway to produce a desired product using our gene shuffling technology in combination with synthetic biology  a type of metabolic engineering in which new genes are introduced into a microbe 
we are using our gene enzyme optimization methodologies in our shell program to optimize fermentation microbes  including optimization of native and introduced non native cellulase genes for increased productivity in our cellulase production microbes  an introduced non native pathway in yeast for the conversion of xylose  a cellulose derived sugar  to ethanol  and an introduced non native pathway in a microbe for the production of codexol detergent alcohols 

table of contents microbe optimization using whole genome shuffling in addition to our gene optimization technology for enzymes  we have another complimentary technology in our platform for the optimization of fermentation microbes called whole genome shuffling 
whole genome shuffling allows us to improve the performance of a fermentation microbe by shuffling unidentified mutations in unidentified genes across the genome 
we start with a diversity of mutational variants of a fermentation organism  generated by conventional means such as random mutagenesis 
our whole genome shuffling involves introducing the entire genome of two or more such cells into a single cell  in which the genetic machinery of the combined cell recombines  or shuffles  the genomes 
in one method  this is accomplished by protoplast fusion  in which the cell walls are removed to leave the cells contents contained only by their cell membranes 
the cell membranes of these protoplasts in the diverse population are induced to fuse together into fusants containing the genome of two or more of the parent cells 
from these fusants  we regenerate normal cells  each with one copy of a hybridized genome 
microbial colonies are then grown and screened for their performance in the fermentative production of the desired product 
this process can be repeated  including with the introduction of new mutations  until the desired performance in the fermentation process is achieved 
one of our collaborators is operating a fermentation process for a generic pharmaceutical product using microbes we developed by whole genome shuffling 
we are using our whole genome shuffling technology in our shell program and our codexol detergent alcohols program to optimize fermentation microbes  including optimization of enzyme production hosts for increased production of cellulase enzymes  ethanol producing yeasts for improved xylose utilization  ethanol productivity  and tolerance to higher ethanol concentrations  and our detergent alcohol producing strain for increased productivity 
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in addition to our proprietary enzyme and microbe optimization technologies  we have built expert capabilities in a suite of new metabolic engineering technologies for the development and optimization of fermentation microbes 
these technologies are generally applicable to our pathway and strain engineering programs 
genomics  transcriptomics  proteomics and metabolomics all provide more in depth analyses of the metabolic functioning of fermentation microbes  and differences between variants  to guide further improvements 
in many cases  these analyses help to identify enzymes that need to be modified removed  increased  stabilized  or otherwise modified in order to increase the overall productivity and performance of the strain 
synthetic biology involves the design  synthesis and introduction of new genetic programming to organisms for new biological functions 
this field has rapidly developed in recent years as dna synthesis and sequencing costs have rapidly dropped 
using synthetic biology  we are taking advantage of the publicly available gene and genome sequence information in our gene and metabolic pathway optimization projects 
this information is being leveraged by our prosar software and multiplexed gene soeing methodologies 
for example  we use synthetic biology in our shell program to introduce non native pathways for xylose utilization and to optimize these pathways 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary products and technology under patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
we also rely heavily on confidential disclosure agreements for further protection of our proprietary products and technologies 
protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products that are not available from our competitors  and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed from 
table of contents other parties 
for example  our ability to supply innovator pharmaceutical manufacturers depends on our ability to supply proprietary enzymes or methods for making pharmaceutical intermediates or apis that are not available from our competitors 
likewise  in the generic pharmaceutical area  proprietary protection  through patent  trade secret or other protection of our enzymes and methods of producing a pharmaceutical product is important for us and our customers to maintain a lower cost production advantage over competitors 
as of december   we owned or controlled approximately issued patents and approximately pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
these patents and patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceutical and bioindustrial markets 
the earliest that any of our intellectual property rights will expire is the issued patents covering our fundamental shuffling technologies have terms ending as late as our us intellectual property rights directed to our second generation enabling technologies have terms that expire from year to we continue to file new patent applications  for which terms generally extend years from the filing date in the united states 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with maxygen s directed evolution technology  known as the molecularbreeding technology platform  including patents  trademarks  copyrights  software and certain assumed contracts 
prior to this transaction  we and maxygen were parties to a license agreement pursuant to which maxygen granted us a worldwide  exclusive license to certain maxygen intellectual property related to the use of directed evolution technology in a variety of fields of use 
since we now own substantially all of the intellectual property rights subject to the original license  the original license with maxygen has been terminated 
the intellectual property rights and assets that we acquired from maxygen will continue to be subject to existing license rights previously granted by maxygen to third parties  including perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  and to novozymes a s  or novozymes 
perseid retains exclusive licenses to use the intellectual property for the discovery  research and development of protein pharmaceuticals 
we and novozymes enjoy co exclusive rights in certain fields  including biofuels 
novozymes did not receive a license to all of the rights we are using in biofuels applications and which we believe are critical to pursuing such applications 
novozymes also has exclusive rights to certain of the intellectual property that we acquired from maxygen in certain limited fields  including development  production and sales of industrial proteins for use in processes for textile  garment  leather  wood and paper production  certain starch  food and animal feed production  certain personal care products  oil drilling  dyestuffs and dyeing  and electronics industry waste water treatment 
as part of the transaction with maxygen  we entered into a new license agreement with maxygen  pursuant to which we granted to maxygen certain license rights to the intellectual property assets that we acquired to the extent necessary for maxygen to fulfill its contractual obligations under the license agreements retained by maxygen 
as part of the transaction  maxygen placed million of the total purchase price in escrow 
as of december   million of the escrowed purchase price has been released to maxygen 
the remaining million remains subject to the escrow arrangement to satisfy any indemnification obligations of maxygen with respect to the transaction 
escrow amounts not used to satisfy such obligations or subject to pending claims will be released to maxygen in september we will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property 
it is possible that our current patents  or patents which we may later acquire  may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part 
it is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect 
we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances 
due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications  sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them 
it is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business 
in addition  any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage  in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity

our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours 
patent  trademark  and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products 
the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to operate under aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
third parties may also design around our proprietary rights  which may render our protected technology and products less valuable  if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace 
in addition  if any of our products or technology is covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights  we could be subject to various legal actions 
we cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement  invalidity  misappropriation  or other claims 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
moreover  any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make  use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology 
competition overview we are a leader in the field of directed molecular evolution of biocatalysts 
we are aware that other companies  including dsm  ei dupont de nemours and company  or dupont  and vercipia biofuels  an affiliate of bp plc  have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity 
academic institutions such as the california institute of technology  the max planck institute and the center for fundamental and applied molecular evolution fame  a jointly sponsored initiative between emory university and georgia institute of technology  are also working in this field 
this field is highly competitive and companies and academic and research institutions are actively seeking to develop technologies that could be competitive with our technologies 
we are aware that other companies  organizations and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our patented proprietary technologies 
in addition  academic institutions are also working in this field 
technological developments by others may result in our products and technologies  as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts  becoming obsolete 
we monitor publications and patents that relate to directed molecular evolution to be aware of developments in the field and evaluate appropriate courses of action in relation to these developments 
many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  personnel and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop competing and or superior technologies and processes  and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could 
our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors 
as more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets  the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases  which could lead to litigation 

table of contents we also face differing forms of competition in our various markets  as set forth below cellulases many established companies are developing cellulases that could potentially compete with codexyme cellulases  including novozymes  which has partnered with gruppo mossi ghisolfi  or m g  in italy to be the cellulase supplier to a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plant being built by m g  dupont  which is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar  dupont danisco cellulosic ethanol  or ddce  is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar  and dsm  which received a grant from the us department of energy to be the lead partner in a technical consortium including abengoa bioenergy new technologies  is developing cost effective enzyme technologies 
although no company is currently converting cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars at commercial scale  many of our competitors have been active in this area for many years  have invested significant resources in this effort  and have extensive patent portfolios regarding the relevant biocatalysts and related processes 
in addition  several companies are focused on developing non biocatalytic  thermochemical processes to convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars 
for example  coskata  inc is developing a hybrid thermochemical biocatalytic process to produce ethanol from a variety of feedstocks 
our cellulases will need to be competitive with all of these alternative products on price and performance 
new companies continue to enter this marketplace 
many of these companies are actively developing and applying for intellectual property rights  including patent rights  in this space 
detergent alcohols and bio based chemicals we announced codexol detergent alcohols in we face competition in this market from sasol  shell  basf  kao corporation and liaoning huaxing  all of which have been active in the detergent alcohol marketplace for many years and have an established history with customers 
we expect to pursue other bio based chemical opportunities  where we will face competition from numerous companies focusing on developing biocatalytic and other solutions for these markets  including a number of the companies described above 
pharmaceuticals our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies using conventional  non enzymatic processes to manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates and apis that compete in the marketplace with our enzymatically manufactured products 
the principal methods of competition and competitive differentiation in this market are product quality and performance  including manufacturing yield and safety and environmental benefits  speed of delivery of product and price 
the market for the manufacture and supply of apis and intermediates is large with many established companies 
these companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers  such as merck  pfizer  and teva  who have significant internal research and development efforts directed at developing processes to manufacture apis and intermediates 
the processes used by these companies include classical conventional organic chemistry reactions  chemo catalysis reactions catalyzed by chemical catalysts  or biocatalytic routes using commercially available enzymes  or combinations thereof 
our manufacturing processes must compete with these internally developed routes 
additionally  there are many large well established fine chemical manufacturing companies that compete to supply pharmaceutical intermediate and apis to our customers  such as dsm  basf corporation and lonza group ltd 
finally  we face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in low cost centers such as india and china 

table of contents in addition to competition from companies manufacturing intermediates and apis  we face competition from companies that sell enzymes for use in the pharmaceutical market 
the market for supplying enzymes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing is quite fragmented 
there is competition from large industrial enzyme companies  such as novozymes and amano enzyme inc  whose industrial enzymes for detergents  for example are occasionally used in pharmaceutical processes 
there is also competition in this area from several small european companies with relatively limited product offerings comprised primarily of naturally occurring enzymes 
in addition to these enzyme supply companies  there is a separate group of small companies  also predominately in europe  that offers enzyme optimization services 
we believe that our principal advantage is our ability to rapidly deliver customized enzyme products for existing and new intermediates and apis in the pharmaceuticals market 
this capability has allowed us to create a breadth of products with improved performance characteristics including  for example  activity  stability  and activity on a range of substrates  compared to traditional chemistry based manufacturing processes and naturally occurring biocatalysts 
we believe that our directed evolution technology provides substantially superior results  in shorter time frames  than companies offering competing biocatalyst development services 
ethanol there is increasing interest and activity in the bioindustrial market directed towards developing alternative manufacturing processes for products that have traditionally been derived from fossil fuel sources  such as transportation fuels 
currently  most biofuels being produced at commercial scale are ethanol derived from sugar and starch food sources  such as sugar cane and corn  and biodiesel produced from vegetable oils  such as soy oil 
these markets are well established with multiple companies  such as the archer daniels midland company  cargill and a number of smaller companies producing ethanol in the united states  and shell producing ethanol in brazil 
our ability to remain competitive in this area will depend on our ongoing technical success in identifying and developing novel biocatalytic routes to fuel products that are cost competitive not only with other biofuels but with petroleum based fuels 
several of our competitors utilize synthetic biology techniques to develop their products 
because these techniques have been in the public domain for many years  we are able to use these techniques together with our gene and genome directed evolution technologies 
we believe that one of our principal advantages  particularly in the bioindustrial space  is that our directed evolution technology may enable us to develop new  more efficient  and therefore more cost effective  biocatalysts and processes in less time than our competitors 
operations we conduct substantial operations outside of the united states 
we have facilities located throughout the world  including in redwood city  california  singapore  and budapest  hungary 
as of december   we employed people worldwide  with of our employees located in redwood city

we also conduct biocatalyst evolution  biocatalyst screening and bioprocess development in singapore 
our facility in hungary collaborates with our headquarters in redwood city in research and development activities relating to microbe improvement and is our center of excellence for strain and fermentation development 
we have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in redwood city 
we expect to rely on third party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future 
our in house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both codex biocatalyst panels and kits and enzymes for use by our customers in pilot scale production 
we also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell 
we rely on a contract manufacturer  lactosan gmbh co 
kg  or lactosan  to manufacture substantially all of the commercial enzymes used in our pharmaceutical business 
we have qualified other contract manufacturers to manufacture biocatalysts for our pharmaceutical business  but we do not currently rely on them for any of our supply requirements 
we also rely on arch  headquartered in mumbai  india  to manufacture certain of our pharmaceutical intermediates and apis as well as to provide sales and marketing support for these products in asia  latin america and the middle east  and marketing support for these products in india  the united states  canada  europe and israel 
in addition  we contract with other suppliers in austria  germany  italy and india 
we intend to rely on contract manufacturers for the production of codexyme cellulase enzymes for our biofuels and bio based chemical businesses 
employees as of december   we had employees 
of these employees  were engaged in research and development  were engaged in manufacturing and operations  and were engaged in general and administrative activities  respectively

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or future results 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company 
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
risks relating to our business and strategy we have a limited operating history  which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance 
our company has been in existence since january from until  our operations focused on organizing and staffing our company and developing our technology platform 
in  we recognized our first revenues from product sales 
since  we have continued to generate revenues  but because our revenue growth has occurred in recent periods  our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance 
any assessments of our current business and predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history 
we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries 
if we do not address these risks successfully  our business will be harmed 
our quarterly or annual operating results may fluctuate in the future 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors  as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and in our annual report on form k our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  our ability to obtain substantial additional capital that may be necessary to expand our business  our relationships with and dependence on collaborators in our principal markets  our dependence on our collaborative research agreement with shell for the development and commercialization of advanced biofuels  which agreement is set to expire in october  our ability to obtain approval from shell to begin collaboration with ra zen on cellulosic ethanol in brazil  the feasibility of producing and commercializing biofuels derived from cellulose  our dependence on  and the need to attract and retain key management and other personnel  including a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer  our dependence on a limited number of customers  our dependence on a limited number of products in our pharmaceutical business  our dependence on one contract manufacturer for commercial scale production of substantially all of our enzymes  the ability of arch to market our pharmaceutical products effectively  our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting  
table of contents our ability to manage our growth  the success of our customers pharmaceutical products in the market and the ability of such customers to obtain regulatory approvals for products and processes  our ability to control and to improve pharmaceutical gross margins  our ability to develop and successfully commercialize new products for the pharmaceuticals market  our ability to maintain license rights for commercial scale expression systems for cellulases  fluctuations in the price of and demand for commodities that our enzymes can be employed to produce or for substitute commodities  the availability  cost and location of renewable cellulosic biomass sources  reductions or changes to existing biofuel regulations and policies  our potential bio based chemical products might not be approved or accepted by our customers  our ability to independently develop  manufacture  market  sell and distribute commercial cellulase enzymes  our ability to obtain and maintain governmental grants  risks associated with the international aspects of our business  our ability to integrate any businesses we may acquire with our business  our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner  our ability to obtain  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to prevent the theft or misappropriation of our biocatalysts  the genes that code for our biocatalysts  know how or technologies  potential advantages that our competitors and potential competitors may have in securing funding or developing products  business interruptions  such as earthquakes and other natural disasters  public concerns about the ethical  legal and social ramifications of genetically engineered products and processes  our ability to comply with laws and regulations  our ability to properly handle and dispose of hazardous materials used in our business  potential product liability claims  the existence of government subsidies or regulation with respect to carbon dioxide emissions  and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
due to the various factors mentioned above  and others  the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 
we have a history of net losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  including losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from research and development agreements with our collaborators and expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these sources for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to extend our existing agreements or enter into new agreements upon 
table of contents the expiration or termination of our existing agreements  our revenues could be adversely affected 
in addition  some of our collaboration agreements provide for milestone payments and future royalty payments  which we will only receive if we and our collaborators develop and commercialize products 
we also expect to spend significant amounts to fund the development of additional pharmaceutical and potential bioindustrial products  including our codexyme cellulase enzymes  codexol detergent alcohols and other products for the advanced biofuel and bio based chemicals markets 
there can be no assurance that any of these products will become commercially viable or that we will ever achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to achieve profitability  or if the time required to achieve profitability is longer than we anticipate  we may not be able to continue our business 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may need substantial additional capital in the future in order to expand our business 
our future capital requirements may be substantial  particularly as we continue to develop our business  including investing in our codexyme cellulase enzymes and codexol detergent alcohols business opportunities 
although we believe that  based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next months  we may need additional capital if our current plans and assumptions change 
our need for additional capital will depend on many factors  including the financial success of our pharmaceutical business  continued funding from shell for our cellulase and ethanol programs  our spending to develop and commercialize new and existing products  the effect of any acquisitions of other businesses  technologies or facilities that we may make or develop in the future  our spending on new market opportunities  including bio based chemicals  and the filing  prosecution  enforcement and defense of patent claims 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements  and we are unable to enter into or maintain collaborations with partners that are able or willing to fund our development efforts or commercialize any products that we develop or enable  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technology and products and complete the commercialization of products  if any  resulting from our technologies 
if future financings involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
if we raise debt financing  we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and fail to generate sufficient revenues to achieve planned gross margins and to control operating costs  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research or development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
we are dependent on our collaborators  and our failure to successfully manage these relationships could prevent us from developing and commercializing many of our products and achieving or sustaining profitability 
our ability to maintain and manage collaborations in our markets is fundamental to the success of our business 
we currently have license agreements  research and development agreements  supply agreements and or distribution agreements with various collaborators 
we may have limited or no control over the amount or timing of resources that any collaborator is able or willing to devote to our partnered products or collaborative efforts 
any of our collaborators may fail to perform their obligations 
these collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our collaborators may not develop products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or devote 
table of contents sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing  or sale of these products 
moreover  disagreements with a collaborator could develop and any conflict with a collaborator could reduce our ability to enter into future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationships with one or more existing collaborators 
if any of these events occur  or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our collaborators  we may not be able to commercialize our existing and potential products  grow our business  or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
our collaboration opportunities could be harmed if we do not achieve our research and development objectives under our collaboration agreements in a timely manner or at all  we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators  we disagree with our collaborators as to rights to intellectual property that are developed during the collaboration  or their research programs or commercialization activities  we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous collaborations  our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors  our collaborators become unable or less willing to expend their resources on research and development or commercialization efforts due to general market conditions  their financial condition or other circumstances beyond our control  or our collaborators experience business difficulties  which could eliminate or impair their ability to effectively perform under our agreements  additionally  our business could be negatively affected if any of our collaborators or suppliers undergoes a change of control or were to otherwise assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements 
for example  under our license agreement with shell  shell may assign the agreement without our consent to controlled affiliates or in connection with a change of control 
if shell or any of our other collaborators were to assign these agreements to a competitor of ours or to a third party who is not willing to work with us on the same terms or commit the same resources as the current collaborator  our business and prospects could be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our collaborative research agreement with shell  which will expire in november if not extended 
our current business plan for biofuels is heavily dependent on our collaborative research agreement with shell  which will continue to be critical to researching and developing successful biocatalysts for producing advanced biofuels 
advanced biofuels are transport fuels derived from non petroleum and non food based sources 
shell s efforts in commercializing advanced biofuels profitably will be critical to our future success 
if we are unable to successfully execute on the development of advanced biofuels for shell  our ability to expand into other bioindustrial areas may be significantly impaired  which will materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
we cannot control the financial resources shell devotes to our programs under the collaborative research agreement 
currently  we receive bi monthly payments from shell that are based on the number of full time employee equivalents  or ftes  that work on our research collaboration with shell 
the number of ftes that work on the program  and the payments from shell for these ftes  are specified in our collaborative research agreement 
shell has the right to reduce the number of funded ftes  with any one reduction not to exceed funded ftes  following advance written notice 
the required notice period ranges from to days 
following any such reduction  shell is subject to a standstill period of between and days during which period shell cannot provide notice of any further fte reductions 
the notice and standstill periods are dependent on the number of funded ftes reduced  with the length of notice and standstill periods increasing commensurate with the number of ftes reduced 
effective august  shell reduced the number of funded ftes engaged in our joint research and development collaboration from to any further reduction could have a material 
table of contents adverse impact on our revenues and business plan for advanced biofuels 
moreover  disputes may arise between us and shell  which could delay the programs on which we are working or could prevent the commercialization of products developed under our research and development collaboration 
if that were to occur  we may have to use funds  personnel  equipment  facilities and other resources that we have not budgeted to undertake certain activities on our own 
disagreements with shell could also result in expensive arbitration or litigation  which may not be resolved in our favor 
performance issues  program delays or termination or unbudgeted use of our resources may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even if we successfully develop commercially viable technologies  our ability to derive revenues from those technologies will be dependent upon shell s willingness and ability to commercialize them 
shell has the right  but not the obligation  to commercialize these technologies 
if shell decides to commercialize our technology  we would need to rely on shell  or other parties selected by shell  to design  finance and construct commercial scale advanced biofuel facilities  and operate commercial scale facilities at costs that are competitive with traditional petroleum based fuels and other alternative fuel technologies that may be developed 
shell could merge with or be acquired by another company or experience financial or other setbacks unrelated to our research collaboration agreement that could adversely affect us 
we have agreed to work exclusively with shell until november in the field of converting cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars that are used in the production of fuels and related products as well as the conversion of these sugars into fuels and related products 
however  shell is not required to work exclusively with us  and could develop or pursue alternative technologies that it decides to use for commercialization purposes instead of the technology developed under our collaborative research agreement with shell 
for example  shell is currently working with virent energy systems to develop a thermo chemical approach to developing biogasoline and biodiesel 
even if shell decides to commercialize products based on our technologies  they have no obligation to purchase their biocatalyst supply from us 
our license agreement with shell prohibits us from licensing any technology developed under the collaboration for the patent life of such technology  which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage in the advanced biofuels market 
we cannot guarantee that our relationship with shell will continue 
our collaborative research agreement with shell expires in november unless extended by the parties 
shell can terminate its collaborative research agreement with us for any or no reason by providing us with nine months notice 
each party also has the right to terminate the license agreement and the collaborative research agreement in the case of an uncured breach by the other party  and to terminate the collaborative research agreement if that party believes the other party has assigned the collaborative research agreement to a direct competitor of the terminating party 
furthermore  in june shell transferred all of its equity interests in us  together with its right to appoint one member to our board of directors  to ra zen energia participa es sa  or ra zen  a brazil based biofuels joint venture between shell and cosan sa if our collaboration with shell were to end  we would likely need to find other collaborators to provide the financial assistance and infrastructure necessary for us to develop and commercialize our products and execute our strategy with respect to advanced biofuels 
failure to maintain this relationship would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and prospects 
the success of our cellulosic ethanol program may be dependent on the performance of other parties 
in connection with our research and development collaboration with shell  we entered into a multiparty collaborative research and license agreement with shell and iogen in july  which is focused on developing technology to convert cellulosic biomass to ethanol for commercial scale production 
either shell or iogen may fail to perform their obligations under this collaboration  may breach or terminate the collaboration agreement or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  they may not devote sufficient resources to the development of technology to convert cellulosic biomass to ethanol or may fail to develop the technology altogether 
moreover  disagreements or conflicts amongst the parties could develop and could negatively impact our development efforts or our relationships with shell and iogen 
disagreements with shell or iogen could also result in expensive arbitration or litigation  which may not be resolved in our favor 
if any of these events occur  or if we fail to maintain this collaboration with shell and iogen  we may be 
table of contents unable to develop technology for use in the production of cellulosic ethanol at commercial scale  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to grow our business 
in addition  the collaborative research and license agreement with shell and iogen terminates in the event i our separate research agreement with shell terminates which agreement will expire in october  unless extended by the parties or ii iogen s separate technology development agreement with shell terminates 
in addition  shell can terminate the collaborative research and license agreement for any or no reason by providing us and iogen with days notice 
any unilateral action by shell to terminate either its separate license agreements with us or iogen will prevent any further research and development activities under the multi party collaboration 
as a result  our ability to pursue research and development activities relating to the conversion of cellulosic biomass and our biofuels programs may be adversely impacted 
we need approval from shell to begin collaboration with ra zen on cellulosic ethanol in brazil 
under our current commercial arrangement with shell  we have agreed to work exclusively with shell on second generation biofuels 
we will need approval from shell before we can collaborate with ra zen on any projects involving the production of cellulosic ethanol in brazil 
we do not know when  or if  this approval from shell will be granted 
our business plan will be significantly impaired if we are not allowed to deploy our cellulosic ethanol technology in brazil with ra zen 
production and commercialization of biofuels and bio based chemicals derived from cellulose may not be feasible 
we are developing codexyme cellulase enzymes for use in producing advanced biofuels and bio based chemicals 
however  production and commercialization of cellulosic biofuels and bio based chemicals may not be feasible for a variety of reasons 
for example  the development of technology for converting sugar derived from cellulosic biomass into a commercially viable biofuel or bio based chemical is still unproven  and we do not know whether this can be done commercially or at all 
to date  there has been limited private and government funding for research and development in advanced biofuels relative to the scope of the challenges presented by this development effort 
furthermore  there have been only a few well directed public policies emphasizing investment in the research and development of  and providing incentives for the commercialization of and transition to  biofuels 
as of the date of this report  we believe that there are no commercial scale cellulosic biofuel or cellulosic bio based chemicals production plants in operation 
there can be no assurance that anyone will be able or willing to develop and operate these production plants at commercial scale or that any of these facilities can be profitable 
additionally  different cellulases may need to be developed for use in different geographic locations to convert the cellulosic biomass available in each locale into sugars that can be used in the production of these biofuels or bio based chemicals 
this will make the development of biofuels or bio based chemicals derived from cellulose more challenging and expensive 
moreover  substantial development of infrastructure will be required for the ethanol market to grow 
areas requiring expansion include  but are not limited to  additional rail capacity  additional storage facilities for ethanol  increases in truck fleets capable of transporting ethanol within localized markets  expansion of refining and blending facilities to handle ethanol  logistics for the collection and storage of cellulosic biomass and growth in the fleet of end user vehicles capable of using ethanol blends 
substantial investments required for infrastructure changes and expansions may not be made on a timely basis or at all 
any delay or failure in making the changes to or expansion of infrastructure could harm demand or prices for ethanol and impose additional costs that would hinder its commercialization 
finally  if existing tax credits  subsidies and other incentives in the united states and foreign markets are phased out or reduced  the overall cost of commercialization of cellulosic biofuels will increase 

table of contents if we lose key personnel  including key management personnel  or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  including a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer  it could disrupt the operation of our business  delay our product development programs  harm our research and development efforts  and we may be unable to pursue collaborations or develop our own products 
our business involves complex  global operations across a variety of markets and requires a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas in which we operate 
the loss of any key members of our management team or the failure to attract or retain other key employees who possess the requisite expertise for the conduct of our business  could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy 
we are currently conducting a search for a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer 
until we are able to hire a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer  we may be unable to manage our business effectively and it may be more difficult for us to hire and retain other personnel 
even if we are able to hire and retain a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer in a timely manner  we may continue to experience operational inefficiency and disruptions during the transition period 
in addition  the loss of any key scientific staff  or the failure to attract or retain other key scientific employees  could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and entering into collaborations or licensing arrangements to execute on our business strategy 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology based businesses  particularly in the areas of biofuels and bio based chemicals  or due to the availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our collaborators and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs 
in particular  our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers 
competition for experienced scientists and other technical personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms 
all of our employees are at will employees  which means that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time 
our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products and processes developed through our technology platform or acquired through strategic or other transactions  especially in the end markets that we seek to penetrate 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
the inability to attract personnel with appropriate skills or to develop the necessary expertise could impair our ability to grow our business 
additionally  we would be in breach of certain agreements  including our collaborative research agreement with shell  if we fail to maintain a specified number of personnel 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers 
our current revenues are derived from a limited number of key customers 
for the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for of our total revenues  with shell accounting for of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for of our total revenues  with shell accounting for of our total revenues 
we expect a limited number of customers to continue to account for a significant portion oftoc our revenues for the foreseeable future 
this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
the loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of our significant customers could materially adversely affect our revenues  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are dependent on a limited number of products in our pharmaceutical business 
our current product revenues are derived from a limited number of pharmaceutical products 
for the year ended december   we derived of our product revenue from two pharmaceutical product families statins  and hepatitis c therapies 
we expect a limited number of pharmaceutical products to continue to account for a significant portion of our pharmaceutical product revenues for the foreseeable future 
this product concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
the loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of our significant pharmaceutical products could materially adversely affect our revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on one contract manufacturer for commercial scale production of substantially all of our enzymes 
we have limited internal capacity to manufacture enzymes 
as a result  we are dependent upon the performance and capacity of third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of the enzymes used in our pharmaceutical and cellulase businesses 
we rely on one contract manufacturer for our pharmaceutical business  lactosan gmbh co 
kg  or lactosan  to manufacture substantially all of the commercial enzymes used in our pharmaceutical business 
our pharmaceutical business  therefore  faces risks of difficulties with  and interruptions in  performance by lactosan  the occurrence of which could adversely impact the availability  launch and or sales of our enzymes in the future 
we have qualified other contract manufacturers to manufacture enzymes for our pharmaceutical business  but we do not currently rely on them for any of our supply requirements 
the failure of any contract manufacturers that we may use to supply manufactured product on a timely basis or at all  or to manufacture our enzymes in compliance with our specifications or applicable quality requirements or in volumes sufficient to meet demand would adversely affect our ability to sell pharmaceutical products  could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
for example  in  we were required to secure an alternative source of certain enzymes when viruses infected the facilities of a contract manufacturer that we were using at the time 
if this or any similar event disrupts the operations of any of our suppliers in the future  we may be forced to secure alternative sources of supply  which may be unavailable on commercially acceptable terms  cause delays in our ability to deliver products to our customers  increase our costs and decrease our profit margins 
we do not have any supply agreements in place with any contract manufacturers  other than lactosan 
in the absence of a supply agreement  a contract manufacturer will be under no obligation to manufacture our enzymes and could elect to discontinue their manufacture at any time 
if we require additional manufacturing capacity and are unable to obtain it in sufficient quantity  we may not be able to increase our pharmaceutical sales  or we may be required to make substantial capital investments to build that capacity or to contract with other manufacturers on terms that may be less favorable than the terms we currently have with our suppliers 
if we choose to build our own additional manufacturing capacity  it could take two years or longer before our facility is able to produce commercial volumes of our enzymes 
any resources we expend on acquiring or building internal manufacturing capabilities could be at the expense of other potentially more profitable opportunities 
in addition  if we contract with other manufacturers  we may experience delays of several months in qualifying them  which could harm our relationships with our collaborators or customers and could negatively affect our revenues or operating results 
we also expect to use contract manufacturers to produce our cellulase enzymes 
our cellulase business will encounter similar risks in engaging contract manufacturers as our pharmaceutical business in the event we elect to use contract manufacturers 

table of contents we rely on arch to market our products in certain regions  and arch may not be able to effectively market our products 
using our enzymes  arch manufactures certain specified apis and intermediates used in the manufacture of apis  that we then purchase and have the right to sell to innovator pharmaceutical companies worldwide  generic pharmaceutical companies in the united states  canada  europe and israel  and certain pharmaceutical companies in india 
arch has the exclusive right to manufacture market and sell such apis and intermediaries to generic pharmaceutical companies in countries other than the united states  canada  europe and israel  and certain other pharmaceutical companies in india 
we must therefore rely on arch for their financial resources and their marketing expertise for the commercialization of such apis and intermediates in these regions 
we cannot control arch s level of activity or expenditures relating to the marketing of such products relative to the rest of their products or marketing efforts 
arch may fail to effectively market our products in these regions 
conflicting priorities  competing demands or other factors that we cannot control  and of which we may not be aware  may cause arch to deemphasize such products 
if we are unable to effectively leverage arch s marketing capabilities or arch does not successfully promote such products in the designated territories as our sole marketing partner  this could harm our business  our revenues and operating results  and our ability to bring such products to the marketplace 
we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting in the future on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our results of operation and result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and adverse effects on our stock price 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to perform an annual evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting 
although  as of december   we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective  we cannot make assurances that  in the future  material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered  a risk that is significantly increased in light of the complexity of our business and multinational operations 
we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes in order to maintain compliance with section  a process that is expensive  time consuming and requires significant management attention 
furthermore  as we grow our business or acquire other businesses  our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify internal control deficiencies in the future  our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be impaired  which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  restatements of our consolidated financial statements  significant expenses to remediate any such deficiencies  a decline in our stock price  suspension or delisting of our common stock by the nasdaq global market  or other material adverse effects on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we may encounter difficulties managing our growth  which could adversely affect our business 
our business has grown rapidly and this growth may continue in the future 
overall  we have grown from approximately employees at the end of to approximately employees as of december  currently  we are working simultaneously on multiple projects targeting several markets 
furthermore  we are conducting our business across several countries  including countries in north america  south america  europe and asia 
these diversified  global operations place increased demands on our limited resources and may require us to expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract  train  manage and retain qualified management  technicians  scientists and other personnel which we may be unable to do effectively 
as our operations expand domestically and internationally  we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various customers  collaborators  suppliers and other third parties 
our ability to manage our operations  growth  and various projects effectively may require us to make 
table of contents additional investments in our infrastructure to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully improve our management information and control systems  including our internal control over financial reporting  to a level necessary to manage our growth and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls that we may not be able to remediate in an efficient or timely manner 
our business could be adversely affected if our customers pharmaceutical products are not received well in the market  if their pharmaceutical products  or the processes used by our customers to manufacture their final pharmaceutical products  fail to be approved  or if our customers discontinue their drug development activities for any reason 
our enzymes are used in the manufacture of intermediates and apis which are then used in the manufacture of final pharmaceutical products by our existing and potential branded drug customers 
our business could be adversely affected if these final pharmaceutical products do not perform in the market as well as expected  or if our customers encounter competition from new entrants into the market with competing  and possibly superior  pharmaceutical products 
additionally  these pharmaceutical products must be approved by the fda in the united states and similar regulatory bodies in other markets prior to commercialization 
if our customers who sell branded drugs  which we refer to as innovators  fail to receive regulatory approval for the drugs  fail to receive regulatory approval for new manufacturing processes for previously approved drugs  or decide for business or other reasons to discontinue their drug development activities  our revenues and prospects will be negatively impacted 
the process of producing these drugs  and their generic equivalents  is also subject to regulation by the fda in the united states and equivalent regulatory bodies in other markets 
if any pharmaceutical process that uses our enzymes does not receive approval by the appropriate regulatory body or if customers decide not to pursue approval  our business could be adversely affected 
our pharmaceutical product gross margins are variable and may decline from quarter to quarter 
our pharmaceutical product gross margins have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a variety of factors  including product mix  pricing pressure from our pharmaceutical customers and competition from other products or technologies 
we do not expect product gross margins for our current generic products to improve in the near or long term  which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize new products for the pharmaceutical market  our business and prospects will be harmed 
we plan to launch new products for the pharmaceutical market 
these efforts are subject to numerous risks  including the following pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to adopt new manufacturing processes that use our enzymes  we may be unable to successfully develop the enzymes or manufacturing processes for our products in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  we may face difficulties in transferring the developed technologies to our customers and the contract manufacturers that we may use for commercial scale production of intermediates and enzymes  the contract manufacturers that we may use may be unable to scale their manufacturing operations to meet the demand for these products and we may be unable to secure additional manufacturing capacity  customers may not be willing to purchase these products for the pharmaceutical market from us on favorable terms  if at all  we may face product liability litigation  unexpected safety or efficacy concerns and pharmaceutical product recalls or withdrawals  
table of contents changes in laws or regulations relating to the pharmaceutical industry could cause us to incur increased costs of compliance or otherwise harm our business  our customers pharmaceutical products may experience adverse events or face competition from new products  which would reduce demand for our products  we may face pressure from existing or new competitive products  and we may face pricing pressures from existing or new competitors  some of which may benefit from government subsidies or other incentives 
if we are unable to maintain license rights to a commercial scale expression system for enzymes that convert cellulosic biomass to sugars  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we entered into a license agreement with dyadic international  inc and its affiliate  or dyadic  in november to obtain access to an expression system and the enzymes that convert cellulosic biomass to sugars 
under the license agreement with dyadic  we obtained a non exclusive license under intellectual property rights of dyadic relating to dyadic s proprietary fungal expression technology for the production of enzymes and to the cellulase enzymes 
we also obtained access to specified materials of dyadic relating to such dyadic technology 
our license is sublicenseable to shell in the field of biofuels 
dyadic has the right to terminate our licenses under the license agreement if we challenge the validity of any of the patents licensed under the license agreement and for various other reasons 
our licenses and access to such materials of dyadic under the license agreement will terminate as a result of any termination of the license agreement other than due to dyadic s material breach 
if we are unable to maintain these rights on commercially reasonable terms or if the license agreement is terminated for any reason  we will need to buy or license this type of expression system from another party or develop this type of expression system ourselves  which may be difficult  costly and time consuming  in part because of the broad  existing intellectual property rights owned by novozymes and ei du pont de nemours and company  or dupont  and others 
if any of these events occur  our business may be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in the price of and demand for certain commodities may reduce demand for the commercial products that use our technology  thus reducing demand for our technology 
biofuels and some bio based chemicals are anticipated to be marketed as an alternative to fossil fuel based products 
therefore  if the price of natural gas or oil falls  any revenues that we generate from biofuel or bio based chemical products could decline  and we may be unable to produce products that are a commercially viable alternative to fossil fuel based products 
additionally  demand for liquid transportation fuels  including biofuels  may decrease due to economic conditions or otherwise 
demand for bio based chemicals may also decrease if the price of natural gas or oil decreases 
similarly  codexyme cellulase enzymes s are used in producing fermentable sugars  which are anticipated to be marketed as an alternative to fermentable sugars from sugar and starch food sources  such as corn and sugar cane 
therefore  if the price of sugar falls  the demand for codexyme cellulase enzymes  may fall  and we may be unable to produce cellulase enzymes for use in producing fermentable sugars that are a commercially viable alternative to fermentable sugars from sugar and starch food sources 
our biofuel and bio based chemical business opportunities may be limited by the availability  cost or location of renewable feedstocks 
our business opportunities in the biofuel and bio based chemical markets may be dependent on the availability and price of feedstocks  including sugar  starch and cellulosic biomass 
if the availability of these feedstocks decreases or their price increases  this may reduce the desirability of our biofuel and bio based chemical products  as well as the biofuels royalties that we collect from shell  and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
at certain levels  prices may make these products uneconomical to use and produce 

table of contents the price and availability of feedstocks may be influenced by general economic  market and regulatory factors 
these factors include the availability of arable land to supply feedstock  weather conditions  farming decisions  logistics for collection and storage of cellulosic biomass  government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade  and global demand and supply 
the significance and relative impact of these factors on the price of feedstocks is difficult to predict  especially without knowing what types of feedstocks we may need to use 
our current business plan for the biofuel and bio based chemical markets is to leverage our primary competitive strength  which we believe is our ability to optimize the performance of codexyme cellulase enzymes rapidly for varying feedstocks and process conditions 
while codexyme cellulase enzymes may perform well on specific feedstocks and under certain process conditions  it might not perform well on other feedstocks or process conditions 
if codexyme cellulase enzymes do not perform as planned on our customers feedstocks  our business may be adversely affected 
reductions or changes to existing biofuel regulations and policies may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers  all of which may significantly reduce demand for biofuels 
the market for biofuels is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the petroleum industry 
in  the us congress passed an alternative fuels mandate that currently calls for approximately billion gallons of liquid transportation fuels sold in to come from alternative sources  including biofuels 
of this amount  a minimum of billion gallons must be advanced biofuels  with billion gallons of that to be cellulosic derived 
in the us and a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
for example  the us environmental protection agency has the authority to adjust or reduce the gallon milestones of the alternative fuels mandate to reflect the marketplace supply availability 
any reduction in mandated requirements for fuel alternatives and additives to gasoline may cause demand for biofuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of biofuels 
congressional and market uncertainty regarding future policies will affect our ability to develop new biofuels products or to license our technologies to third parties 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our biofuels business  financial condition and operating results 
our other potential bioindustrial products may be subject to additional regulations 
we cannot assure you that our potential bio based chemical products will be approved or accepted by customers 
we have only recently entered the market for bio based chemical products used by large consumer products or chemical companies through our collaboration with gruppo mossi ghisolfi  or m g  and we intend to explore other opportunities in these markets 
in entering these markets  we intend to sell our bio based chemical products  like codexol detergent alcohols  as alternatives to chemicals currently in use  and in some cases the chemicals that we seek to replace have been used for many years 
the potential customers for our bio based chemical products generally have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may resist changing these processes and components 
these potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers 
factors that these potential customers consider during the product qualification process include consumer preference  manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components  supplier operating history  regulatory issues  product liability and other factors  many of which are unknown to  or not well understood by  us 
satisfying these processes may take many months or years 
if we are unable to convince these potential customers that our products are comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that the use of our products produces benefits to them  we will not be successful in these markets and our business will be adversely affected 
additionally  in contrast to the tax incentives relating to biofuels  tax credits and subsidies are not currently available in the united states for consumer products or chemical companies who use our bio based chemical products 

table of contents we have only limited experience in independently developing  manufacturing  marketing  selling and distributing commercial cellulase enzymes 
we currently have only limited resources and capability to develop  manufacture  market  sell or distribute codexyme cellulase enzymes on a commercial scale 
we will determine how to best deploy these limited resources based on various criteria  including investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue collaborations for the development and commercialization of codexyme cellulase enzymes that we intended to pursue independently 
we may pursue opportunities that ultimately require more resources than we anticipate or which may be technically unsuccessful 
in order for us to commercialize codexyme cellulase enzymes directly  we would need to establish or obtain through outsourcing arrangements additional capability to develop  manufacture  market  sell and distribute codexyme cellulase enzymes 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize codexyme cellulase enzymes resulting from our internal product development efforts  we will continue to incur losses 
even if we successfully develop and commercialize codexyme cellulase enzymes  we may not generate significant sales and achieve profitability in our business 
our government grants are subject to uncertainty  which could harm our business and results of operations 
we have received various government grants to complement and enhance our own resources 
we may seek to obtain government grants and subsidies in the future to offset all or a portion of the costs of building additional manufacturing facilities and research and development activities 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to secure any such government grants or subsidies 
any of our existing grants or new grants that we may obtain may be terminated  modified or recovered by the granting governmental body under certain conditions 
we are subject to routine audits by government agencies or other third parties as part of our government grants contracts 
the government auditor may review our performance  cost structures and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
funds available under grants must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the granting agencies  rather than for all of our programs generally 
if any of our costs are found to be allocated improperly  the costs may not be reimbursed and any costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded 
accordingly  an audit could result in an adjustment to our revenues and results of operations 
we face risks associated with our international business 
significant portions of our operations are conducted outside of the united states and we expect to continue to have significant foreign operations in the foreseeable future 
international business operations are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products  repatriate profits to the united states or operate our foreign located facilities  the imposition of tariffs  the imposition of limitations on  or increase of  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures  the imposition of limitations on genetically engineered products or processes and the production or sale of those products or processes in foreign countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  uncertainties relating to foreign laws  regulations and legal proceedings including tax  anti corruption and exchange control laws  the availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us  
table of contents economic or political instability in foreign countries  difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  and the need to comply with a variety of us and foreign laws applicable to the conduct of international business  including import and export control laws and anti corruption laws 
many of our pharmaceutical intermediates are manufactured in india  which has stringent local regulations that make it difficult for money earned in india to be taken out of the country without being subject to indian taxes 
while our indian subsidiary can make use of some of the funds we earn in india  these regulations may limit the amount of profits we can repatriate from operations in india 
additionally  we have recently begun doing business in brazil and we will likely need to secure licenses  permits or other governmental approvals in order to use our technology there 
the failure to obtain any applicable licenses  permits or other governmental approvals could delay or prevent the deployment of our technology in brazil 
if we engage in any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past  and if appropriate opportunities become available  we expect to acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products to enhance our business in the future 
for example  in october  we acquired substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with maxygen s dirted evolution technology 
in connection with any future acquisitions  we could issue additional equity securities which would dilute our current stockholders  incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions  use our cash to fund the acquisitions  or assume significant liabilities including litigation risk 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and other liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and or prospective collaborators  customers and or suppliers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
we do not have extensive experience in managing the integration process and we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  assets  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
the integration process could divert management s time from focusing on operating our business  result in a decline in employee morale and cause retention issues to arise from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects or the direction of the business 
acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may acquire companies that have insufficient internal financial controls  which could impair our ability to integrate the acquired company and adversely impact our financial reporting 
if we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we must rely on our suppliers  contract manufacturers and customers to deliver timely and accurate information in order to accurately report our financial results in the time frame and manner required by law 
we need to receive timely  accurate and complete information from a number of third parties in order to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis 
we rely on third parties that sell our pharmaceutical products that are manufactured using our biocatalysts to provide us with complete and accurate information 
table of contents regarding revenues  costs of revenues and payments owed to us on a timely basis 
in addition  we rely on suppliers and certain contract manufacturers  including arch  to provide us with timely and accurate information regarding our inventories and manufacturing cost information  and we rely on current and former collaborators to provide us with product sales and cost saving information in connection with royalties owed to us 
any failure to receive timely information from one or more of these third parties could require that we estimate a greater portion of our revenues and other operating performance metrics for the period  which could cause our reported financial results to be incorrect 
moreover  if the information that we receive is not accurate  our financial statements may be materially incorrect and may require restatement  and we may not receive the full amount of revenues that we are entitled to under these arrangements 
although we typically have audit rights with these parties  performing such an audit could be harmful to our collaborative relationships  expensive and time consuming and may not be sufficient to reveal any discrepancies in a timeframe consistent with our reporting requirements 
our ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary technologies or if we lose some of our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property for our technologies and products and potential products in the united states and other countries 
we have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the united states and in foreign countries with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes 
as such  as of december   we owned or controlled approximately issued patents and approximately pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
some of our gene shuffling patents will expire as early as we also have license rights to a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to our enabling technologies and to the methods and products that support our business in the pharmaceuticals and bioindustrials markets 
we intend to continue to apply for patents relating to our technologies  methods and products as we deem appropriate 
numerous patents in our portfolio involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with any certainty 
issued patents and patents issuing from pending applications may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
moreover  the us leahy smith america invents act  enacted in september  brings significant changes to the us patent system  which include a change to a first to file system from a first to invent system and changes to the procedures for challenging issued patents and disputing patent applications during the examination process  among other things 
the effects of these changes on our patent portfolio and business have yet to be determined  as the us patent and trademark office must still implement regulations relating to these changes and us courts have yet to address the new provisions  but in any event  these changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights 
additional uncertainty may result from legal precedent handed down by the united states federal circuit and supreme court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  or even if issued  predict the breadth of the claims upheld in our and other companies patents 
given that the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  we cannot ensure that i we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending applications  ii we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  or iii the proprietary technologies we develop will be patentable 
in addition  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
moreover  third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection 
such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the united states or other territories 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
moreover  others may independently develop and obtain patents for 
table of contents technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies  and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause harm to our business 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights  which may subject us to costly and time consuming litigation and prevent us from developing or commercializing our products 
our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties  and without breaching any licenses or other agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technologies  products and business 
we cannot ensure that patents have not been issued to third parties that could block our ability to obtain patents or to operate as we would like 
there may be patents in some countries that  if valid  may block our ability to make  use or sell our products in those countries  or import our products into those countries  if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents 
there also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that  if granted and valid  may also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in these countries if we are unable to circumvent or license them 
the industries in which we operate  and the biotechnology industry in particular  are characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
many biotechnology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
our involvement in litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the united states  to defend our intellectual property rights or as a result of alleged infringement of the rights of others  may divert our management s time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant amounts of money 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  or using our products or technologies that use the subject intellectual property  pay monetary damages or substantial royalties  grant cross licenses to third parties relating to our patents or proprietary rights  obtain from the third party asserting its intellectual property rights a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing technology  or relocate the operations relating to the allegedly infringing technology to another jurisdiction  which may result in significant cost or delay to us  could be technically infeasible or could prevent us from selling some of our products in the united states or other jurisdictions 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by  and issued to  third parties 
we cannot assure you that if this third party intellectual property is asserted against us that we would ultimately prevail 
if any of our competitors have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention and  thus  the right to the patents for these inventions in the united states 
these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable 
even if successful  any interference may result in loss of certain claims 
any litigation or proceedings could divert our management s time and efforts 
even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses  diversion of management time  and disruption in our business 
uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any patent or related litigation could harm our ability to compete 

table of contents we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
the laws of some foreign countries  including india  where we manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates and apis through contract manufacturers  and brazil  where we have recently begun to do business  do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or bioindustrial technologies 
accordingly  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
additionally  proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
if our biocatalysts  or the genes that code for our biocatalysts  are stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  others could use these biocatalysts or genes to produce competing products 
third parties  including our contract manufacturers  customers and those involved in shipping our biocatalysts often have custody or control of our biocatalysts 
if our biocatalysts  or the genes that code for our biocatalysts  were stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce these biocatalysts for their own commercial gain 
if this were to occur  it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use  especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection or in countries in which we do not have patents covering the misappropriated biocatalysts 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
we rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  but these measures may not be effective 
we require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property 
nevertheless  our proprietary information may be disclosed  third parties could reverse engineer our biocatalysts and others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
competitors and potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or may use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense 
the biocatalysis industry and each of our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
in addition  as we enter new markets  we will face new competition and will need to adapt to competitive factors that may be different from what we face today 
we are aware that other companies  including royal dsm nv  or dsm  dupont  novozymes  and vercipia biofuels  an affiliate of bp plc  have alternative methods for obtaining and generating genetic diversity or use 
table of contents mutagenesis techniques to produce genetic diversity 
academic institutions such as the california institute of technology  the max planck institute and the center for fundamental and applied molecular evolution fame  a jointly sponsored initiative between emory university and georgia institute of technology  are also working in this field 
technological development by others may result in our products and technologies  as well as products developed by our customers using our biocatalysts  becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition in the pharmaceuticals market 
there are a number of companies who compete with us throughout the various stages of a pharmaceutical product s lifecycle 
many large pharmaceutical companies have internal capabilities to develop and manufacture intermediates and apis 
these companies include many of our large innovator and generic pharmaceutical customers  such as merck  pfizer and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
there are also many large  well established fine chemical manufacturing companies  such as dsm  basf corporation and lonza group ltd  that compete to supply pharmaceutical intermediates and apis to our customers 
we also face increasing competition from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers in low cost centers such as india and china 
in addition to competition from companies manufacturing apis and intermediates  we face competition from companies that sell biocatalysts for use in the pharmaceutical market 
there is competition from large industrial enzyme companies  such as novozymes and amano enzyme inc  whose industrial enzymes for detergents  for example are occasionally used in pharmaceutical processes 
there is also competition in this area from several small companies with product offerings comprised primarily of naturally occurring biocatalysts or that offer biocatalyst optimization services 
we expect to enter the market for cellulases  which are used to produce sugar for the manufacture of biofuels and bio based chemicals 
our significant competitors in this market include novozymes and dupont  which have both been active in this market for many years 
novozymes  has partnered with a number of companies and organizations on a regional basis to develop cellulases for the production of biofuels  including partnering with m g in italy to be the cellulase supplier to a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plant being built by m g  and dupont is marketing a line of cellulases to convert cellulosic biomass into sugar 
these competitors have greater resources than we do  own or otherwise control established intellectual rights portfolios  have existing relationships with customers that we hope to sell codexyme cellulases to  have long term supply agreements already in place with customers for their bio based products  and have the supply chain in place to sell their cellulases on a global platform 
our ability to compete in this market may be limited by our relatively late start 
there are also other companies developing competing cellulosic ethanol technologies 
significant competitors include companies such as novozymes  which is opening a biofuel demonstration plant with inbicon a s of denmark  dupont danisco cellulosic ethanol  or ddce  which is developing facilities to produce cellulosic ethanol  dsm  which recently acquired c yeast company bv enhancing dsm s position in the cellulosic biofuel sector  mascoma corporation  which entered into a definitive agreement with valero energy corporation in december to build a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol biorefinery  bp  which is developing a commercial scale cellulosic ethanol facility through its affiliate vercipia biofuels  and coskata  inc  which is developing a hybrid thermochemical biocatalytic process to produce ethanol from a variety of feedstocks 
with our codexol detergent alcohols  we have recently entered the bio based chemical market 
our significant competitors in this market include companies that have been active in this marketplace for many years  namely sasol  shell  basf  kao corporation and liaoning huaxing 
these companies have greater resources in this market than we do and have long term supply arrangements already in place with consumer products companies 
our ability to compete in this market may be limited by our relatively late start 
our ability to compete successfully in any of these markets will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner and are technologically superior to and or are less expensive than other products on the market 
many of our competitors have substantially greater production  financial  research and development  personnel and marketing resources than we do 
they also started developing products 
table of contents earlier than we did  which may allow them to establish blocking intellectual property positions or bring products to market before we can 
in addition  certain of our competitors may also benefit from local government subsidies and other incentives that are not available to us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop competing and or superior technologies and processes  and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could 
our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors 
we cannot be certain that any products we develop in the future will compare favorably to products offered by our competitors or that our existing or future products will compare favorably to any new products that are developed by our competitors 
as more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets  the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases  which could lead to litigation 
in addition  various governments have recently announced a number of spending programs focused on the development of clean technology  including alternatives to petroleum based fuels 
such spending programs could lead to increased funding for our competitors or the rapid increase in the number of competitors within those markets 
our limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures 
this failure could reduce our competitiveness and market share  adversely affect our results of operations and financial position  and prevent us from obtaining or maintaining profitability 
business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales 
our headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations  such as riot  civil disturbances  war  terrorist acts  flood  infections in our laboratory or production facilities or those of our contract manufacturers and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur 
any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and success as an overall business 
furthermore  shell may terminate our collaborative research agreement if a force majeure event interrupts our collaboration activities for more than ninety days 
ethical  legal and social concerns about genetically engineered products and processes could limit or prevent the use of our products  processes  and technologies and limit our revenues 
some of our products and processes are genetically engineered or involve the use of genetically engineered products or genetic engineering technologies 
if we and or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical  legal  and social concerns relating to genetic engineering  our products and processes may not be accepted 
any of the risks discussed below could result in increased expenses  delays  or other impediments to our programs or the public acceptance and commercialization of products and processes dependent on our technologies or inventions 
our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our technologies  products  or processes could be limited by the following factors public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of  and ethical concerns over  genetic research and genetically engineered products and processes  which could influence public acceptance of our technologies  products and processes  public attitudes regarding  and potential changes to laws governing ownership of genetic material  which could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborators from supporting  developing  or commercializing our products  processes and technologies  and 
table of contents governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning genetically modified organisms  which could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and derivative products 
the subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative publicity  which has aroused public debate 
this adverse publicity could lead to greater regulation and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products 
the biocatalysts that we develop have significantly enhanced characteristics compared to those found in naturally occurring enzymes or microbes 
while we produce our biocatalysts only for use in a controlled industrial environment  the release of such biocatalysts into uncontrolled environments could have unintended consequences 
any adverse effect resulting from such a release could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  and we may have exposure to liability for any resulting harm 
compliance with stringent laws and regulations may be time consuming and costly  which could adversely affect the commercialization of our bioindustrial products 
our bioindustrial products  including those used in the biofuels and bio based chemicals markets  will need to meet a significant number of regulations and standards  including regulations imposed by the us department of transportation  the us environmental protection agency  various state agencies and others 
in addition  our bioindustrial products will be subject to foreign regulations if we attempt to produce or sell our products outside the united states 
for example  we expect that our products and technologies will be subject to import and export controls when they are shipped internationally 
any failure to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry regulations and standards could prevent or delay the commercialization of any bioindustrial products developed using our technologies and subject us to fines and other penalties 
we use hazardous materials in our business and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials or noncompliance of applicable laws and regulations could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemical  radioactive  and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste 
we cannot eliminate entirely the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of  and human exposure to  these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with environmental laws  there can be no assurance that violations of environmental  health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error  accident  equipment failure or other causes 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and the failure to comply with past  present  or future laws could result in the imposition of fines  third party property damage  product liability and personal injury claims  investigation and remediation costs  the suspension of production  or a cessation of operations  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations  which could impair our research  development or production efforts and harm our business 
we may be sued for product liability 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
for example  we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to drugs that are produced using our enzymes or that incorporate our intermediates and apis 
the biocatalysts  pharmaceutical intermediates and apis that we produce or are produced for us by our manufacturing partners could be subject to quality control or contamination issues of which we are not aware 

table of contents claims could be brought by various parties  including customers who are purchasing products directly from us  other companies who purchase products from our customers or by the end users of the drugs 
we could also be named as co parties in product liability suits that are brought against our contract manufacturers who manufacture our enzymes  pharmaceutical intermediates and apis  such as lactosan and or arch 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturer has adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims 
in addition  although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against us  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses  and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
moreover  we have agreed to indemnify some of our customers for certain claims that may arise out of the use of our products  which could expose us to significant liabilities 
if governmental incentives or other actions targeted at limiting carbon emissions are not adopted  a broad market for carbon management solutions may not develop 
our strategy with respect to carbon management  although still in the research phase  would likely require an expansion of the market for the management of carbon dioxide emissions prior to us being able to recognize significant revenues from our research and continuing expenditures of resources 
the development of a significant market will likely depend on the adoption of government subsidies or other government regulation requiring companies to limit their carbon emissions 
in the united states  for example  there is no current market for carbon management 
the establishment of a carbon management market in the united states could take years to develop  if ever 
the united states senate  for example  failed to pass carbon regulating legislation in in the absence of such additional government subsidies or regulation in major markets  this carbon management market may not develop and we would not be able to generate significant revenues from our carbon management operations 
even if a carbon management market is established  we will not be able to commercialize our potential carbon management solutions if the price of carbon is below the cost to deploy our solutions 
in addition  the development of transportation and storage infrastructure for carbon dioxide will be necessary to deploy our carbon capture technology in certain markets 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to offset future taxable income 
if the internal revenue service challenges our analysis that our existing nols are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the internal revenue code 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code 
furthermore  our ability to utilize nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations 
for these reasons  we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the nols reflected on our balance sheet  even if we attain profitability 
risks related to owning our common stock we are subject to anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us 
among other things  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide 
table of contents for a board of directors which is divided into three classes  with staggered three year terms and provide that all stockholder action must be effected at a duly called meeting of the stockholders and not by a consent in writing  and further provide that only our board of directors  the chairman of the board of directors  our chief executive officer or president may call a special meeting of the stockholders 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
these provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits  with some exceptions  stockholders owning in excess of of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
finally  our charter documents establish advanced notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if an offer to acquire our company may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
concentration of ownership among our existing officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price 
based on the number of shares outstanding as of december   our officers  directors and stockholders who hold at least of our stock together beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if these officers  directors  and principal stockholders or a group of our principal stockholders act together  they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders 
for instance  officers  directors  and principal stockholders  acting together  could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider 
similarly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders 
as of december   ra zen  biomedical sciences investment fund pte ltd 
and cmea ventures beneficially owned approximately  and of our common stock  respectively 
our share price may be volatile which may cause the value of our common stock to decline and subject us to securities class action litigation 
the market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section  and others beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results  the position of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors operating results or changes in their growth rate  announcements of technological innovations by us  our collaborators or our competitors  announcements by us  our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  any changes in shell s biofuels strategy or timelines  or in our relationship with shell  including any decision by shell to terminate our collaboration or reduce the number of ftes funded by shell under our collaborative research agreement  
table of contents shell s failure to extend our collaborative research agreement  which expires in november  any announcements or developments from ra zen  additions or losses of one or more significant pharmaceutical products  announcements or developments regarding pharmaceutical products manufactured using our biocatalysts  intermediates and apis  the entry into  modification or termination of collaborative arrangements  additions or losses of customers  additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel  failure to find a permanent chief executive officer and a permanent chief financial officer  competition from existing products or new products that may emerge  issuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  changes in existing laws  regulations and policies applicable to our business and products  including the national renewable fuel standard program  announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts  sales of our common stock by us  our insiders or our other stockholders  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  general market conditions in our industry  and general economic and market conditions  including the recent financial crisis 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  or publish negative reports about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock in a negative manner  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

table of contents we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  as well as related rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market  impose various requirements on public companies that require our management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our compliance with section requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance related issues 
moreover  if we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of section  our stock price could decline  and we could face sanctions  delisting or investigations by the nasdaq global market  or other material adverse effects on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

we are a producer of custom industrial enzymes 
our products enable novel  sustainable processes for the manufacture of biofuels  chemicals  and pharmaceutical ingredients 
we are developing our flagship codexyme cellulase enzymes to convert non food plant material  which we call cellulosic biomass  into affordable sugars  which can then be converted into renewable fuels and chemicals 
we have been developing these cellulase enzymes with royal dutch shell plc  or shell  since for applications in the biofuels markets 
we intend to market codexyme cellulase enzymes to chemicals manufacturers worldwide 
we are also developing our own novel processes to manufacture certain specialty and bio based commodity chemicals  which we intend to commercialize with strategic partners 
the first of these products is codexol detergent alcohols 
detergent alcohols are used to manufacture surfactants  which are key  active cleaning ingredients in consumer products such as shampoos  liquid soaps and laundry detergents 
we have commercialized our technology  products and services in the pharmaceuticals market 
there are currently over pharmaceutical firms using our technology  products and services in their manufacturing process development  including the production of some of the world s bestselling and fastest growing drugs 
we create our products by applying our codeevolver directed evolution technology platform which introduces genetic mutations into microorganisms  giving rise to changes in the enzymes which they produce 
once we identify potentially beneficial mutations  we test combinations of these mutations until we have created variant enzymes that exhibit marketable performance characteristics superior to competitive products 
this process allows us to make continuous  efficient improvements to the performance of our enzymes 
to date  we have generated revenues primarily from collaborative research and development funding  pharmaceutical product sales and government grants 
our revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years  growing from million in  to million in and million in most of our revenues since inception have been derived from collaborative research and development arrangements  which accounted for   and of our revenues in   and  respectively 
collaborative research and development received from shell accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 

table of contents our product sales accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
our product sales have increased in each of the last three fiscal years  from million in  to million in and to million in notwithstanding our revenue growth  we have continued to experience significant losses as we have invested heavily in research and development and administrative infrastructure in connection with the growth in our business 
in light of the growth in market acceptance of our products and services to date  we intend to continue our investment in research and development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we targeted the pharmaceutical industry as the first market for our products and services 
in this market  we have historically entered into collaborations  which have involved complex service and intellectual property agreements under which we research and develop optimized enzymes for innovator pharmaceutical companies in connection with their drug development efforts 
in these collaborations  we typically receive revenues in the form of one or more of the following up front payments  milestone payments  payments based upon the number of full time employee equivalents  or ftes  engaged in related research and development activities and licensing fees and royalties 
our pharmaceutical products include enzymes  pharmaceutical intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
our pharmaceutical customers incorporate our enzymes into the manufacturing processes used to produce their drugs 
our intermediates are complex chemical substances that have been manufactured by  or on behalf of  us using our enzymes 
drug manufacturers use intermediates to produce the apis used in their drugs 
we believe that major pharmaceutical manufacturers are increasingly willing to outsource portions of their own internal manufacturing and to purchase intermediates that are difficult or expensive to manufacture 
our codex biocatalyst panels are tools that provide genetically diverse variants of our proprietary biocatalysts  which allow our customers to screen our enzymes for desired activity that is applicable to a particular pharmaceutical manufacturing process 
we view our codex biocatalyst panels  which we began selling in  as a way to build early and broad awareness of the power and utility of our technology platform 
we introduced our codex biocatalyst kits in  which provide subsets of the panel enzymes in individual vials for the same purpose 
we plan to increase our efforts to expand use of our codex biocatalyst panels and kits among our current and potential customers 
our pharmaceutical services include screening and optimization services 
we use our screening services to test our customers pharmaceutical materials against our existing libraries of enzymes to determine whether our existing enzymes produce any desired activities 
we then use our optimization services to improve the performance of these enzymes to meet customer requirements 
we also use our optimization services to improve enzymes identified by our customers through their use of our codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
the use of our panels  as well as these services  has led to sales of enzymes to our pharmaceutical customers 
we provide our enzymes  codex biocatalyst panels and kits  screening and optimization services and intermediates to our innovator customers and provide intermediates to our generics customers 
we have also launched several new intermediates and apis for the generic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products  including lipitor  in markets where these products are not subject to patent protection  and intend to sell these same intermediates and apis for use in other markets when the patent protection for each product expires 
we sell our products primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers through our small direct sales and business development force in the united states and europe 
in the biofuels market  we entered into a research agreement with shell in the goal of this collaboration was to develop biocatalysts to break down renewable sources of non food plant materials  known as cellulosic biomass  and convert them to fuels 
in connection with this collaboration  we received up front payments  research and development service payments and milestone payments 

table of contents based on the success of this initial collaboration  in  we entered into a new  expanded multi year research and development collaboration with shell to develop cellulase enzymes to convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars that are used in the production of fuels and related products and to convert these sugars into fuels and related products 
we received an up front fee and are currently receiving fte payments under this collaboration 
this up front fee is refundable under certain conditions  such as a change in control in which we are acquired by a competitor of shell 
this refundability lapses ratably over a five year period beginning on november   on a straight line basis 
in march  we agreed to devote to the research collaboration ftes  which were required to be funded by shell at an annual base rate per fte of  for ftes located in the united states  and  for ftes located in hungary 
these annual base rates per fte are subject to annual adjustments based on changes in the consumer price index  or cpi  for the united states and hungary for each subsequent year of the collaboration 
as of december  the annual base rate per fte was  for ftes located in the united states  and  for ftes located in hungary 
shell has the right to terminate the collaborative research agreement upon nine months notice 
shell also has the right to reduce the number of funded ftes  with any one reduction not to exceed funded ftes  following advance written notice 
the required notice period ranges from to days 
following any such reduction  shell is subject to a standstill period of between and days during which period shell cannot provide notice of any further fte reductions 
the notice and standstill periods are dependent on the number of funded ftes reduced  with the length of notice and standstill periods increasing commensurate with the number of ftes reduced 
effective august  shell reduced the number of funded ftes engaged in our research and development collaboration from to ftes 
this reduction was to ftes located in the united states 
we have not received any further notice of fte reduction as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the term of the agreement ends in october we are in discussions with shell for a continuation of the collaboration agreement 
during the term of the agreement  we are required to act exclusively with shell as it relates to the rights and research described in the arrangement and may not conduct research or contract to conduct research  for another party in the field of use 
under this agreement  we also have a right of first negotiation but not an obligation to manufacture any biocatalysts developed under the collaborative research agreement if shell decides to out source the manufacture of such biocatalysts 
we are also eligible for annual milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million over the term of the agreement  contingent upon the achievement of certain technical goals beginning in  and a milestone payment of million upon achievement of certain commercial goals 
in  we met or exceeded four out of six technical goals under the collaborative research agreement by the applicable deadlines and earned milestone payments of million 
as of december   we remain eligible for million in milestone payments related to the technical goals for and million in milestone payments for the commercial goals 
shell will also be required to pay us a royalty per gallon with respect to certain products manufactured using our technology platform  including liquid fuels  fuel additives and lubricants  if shell or any of its licensees manufactures such products 
with respect to cellulosic biomass converted into sugars  shell agreed to pay us a royalty per gallon of fuel product made from those sugars 
with respect to sugars converted into fuel  shell agreed to pay us a separate royalty per gallon of fuel product 
we may be entitled to receive one or both of these royalties depending on whether shell uses our technology to commercialize one or both of these steps 
under our research and development collaboration with shell  we retain ownership of all intellectual property we develop  other than patent rights related to certain fuel innovations  and shell will have an exclusive license to such intellectual property we develop 
we have agreed to work exclusively with shell until november to convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars that are used in the production of fuels and related products and to convert these sugars into fuels and related products 
however  shell is not required to work exclusively with us  and could develop or pursue alternative technologies that it decides to use for commercialization purposes instead of any technology developed under our collaborative research agreement 
even if shell decides to commercialize products based on our technologies  they have no obligation to purchase their biocatalyst supply from us 
if shell chooses to commercialize any biofuels products developed through our 
table of contents collaboration  we believe that the combination of our technology platform with shell s proven project development capabilities and resources could enable a biofuels solution that extends from the conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels to delivery and distribution of refined biofuels to consumers at the pump 
in connection with our collaboration with shell  we entered into a multi party collaborative research and license agreement with iogen energy corporation  or iogen  and shell in july  which is focused on the conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol for commercial scale production 
iogen has agreed to pay us a royalty per gallon with respect to certain fuel products  which include liquid fuels  fuel additives and lubricants  that are covered by inventions jointly made by us and iogen  but that are solely owned by iogen 
we will be entitled to collect royalties from shell or iogen for any use of our biofuels technology by shell or iogen 
shell can choose to commercialize cellulosic ethanol manufactured using our technology independently  or in collaboration with iogen 
in october  we acquired maxygen inc s  or maxygen  directed evolution technology patent portfolio for net consideration of million consisting of million paid to maxygen  related transaction costs of million and a royalty payable extinguishment of million 
in conjunction with this transaction  we terminated our existing license agreement with maxygen including terminating our obligation to pay biofuels royalties to maxygen 
during  our carbon management program received million in funding under a arpa e recovery act program grant from the us department of energy for development of innovative technology to remove carbon dioxide from coal fired power plant emissions 
the grant supports development of biocatalysts for more efficient carbon capture from these plants and terminates in june we also had a collaboration in carbon management with alstom power  inc or alstom which included funding for up to ftes 
we recognized million in revenue in from this collaboration 
the collaboration terminated in october we also received grant revenues in of million from the singapore economic development board  or edb  for our pharmaceuticals research and development center in singapore 
our strategy for collaborative arrangements is to retain substantial participation in the future economic value of our technology while receiving current cash payments to offset research and development costs and working capital needs 
these agreements are complex and have multiple elements that cover a variety of present and future activities 
in addition  certain elements of these agreements are intrinsically difficult to separate and treat as separate units for accounting purposes  especially exclusivity payments 
consequently  we expect to recognize these exclusivity payments over the term of the exclusivity period 
we have limited internal manufacturing capacity at our headquarters in redwood city  california 
we expect to rely on third party manufacturers for commercial production of our biocatalysts for the foreseeable future 
our in house manufacturing is dedicated to producing both our codex biocatalyst panels and kits and biocatalysts for use by our customers in pilot scale production 
we also supply initial commercial quantities of biocatalysts for use by our collaborators to produce pharmaceutical intermediates and manufacture biocatalysts that we sell 
we actively seek contract manufacturers who are willing to invest in capital equipment to manufacture our products at commercial scale 
as a result  we are heavily dependent on the availability of manufacturing capacity at  and the reliability of  our contract manufacturers 
we also pursue collaborations with industry leaders that allow us to leverage our collaborators engineering  manufacturing and commercial expertise  their distribution infrastructure and their ability to fund commercial scale production facilities 
if our collaborators choose to utilize our technology to commercialize new products  we expect our collaborators will finance  build and operate the larger  more expensive facilities for the intermediate or end products in our markets  which will allow us to expand into new markets without having to finance or operate large industrial facilities 

table of contents we rely on one contract manufacturer  lactosan gmbh co 
kg  or lactosan  located in austria  to manufacture substantially all of the enzymes used in our pharmaceutical business 
we have qualified other contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our enzymes  but we do not currently use them for any of our supply commitments 
in addition  we contract with other suppliers for the manufacture of our pharmaceutical intermediates and apis 
since  arch pharmalabs limited  or arch  of mumbai  india has manufactured all of our commercialized intermediates and apis for sale to generic and innovator manufacturers 
we are party to a number of agreements with arch that govern the commercialization of various current and future products for supply into the generic and innovator marketplaces 
we intend to rely on contract manufacturers for the production of codexyme cellulase enzymes for our biofuels and bio based chemicals business 
revenues and operating expenses revenues our revenues are comprised of collaborative research and development revenues  product revenues and government grants 
collaborative research and development revenues include license  technology access and exclusivity fees  fte payments  milestones  royalties  and optimization and screening fees 
product revenues consist of sales of biocatalysts  intermediates  apis and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
government grants consist of payments from government entities 
the terms of these grants generally provide us with cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
historically  we have received government grants from germany  singapore and the united states 
our current grant in singapore expires in and our grant in the united states expires in cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes both internal and third party fixed and variable costs including amortization of purchased technology  materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs associated with our product revenues 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal projects as well as partner funded collaborative research and development activities 
these costs include license and royalty fees paid to maxygen prior to our acquisition of the maxygen ip  for consideration that we receive in connection with our biofuels collaboration  our direct and research related overhead expenses  which include salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  depreciation of facilities  and laboratory equipment  as well as research consultants and the cost of funding research at universities and other research institutions  and are expensed as incurred 
license and royalty fees paid to maxygen fluctuated depending on the timing and type of consideration received from shell in connection with our biofuels research and development collaboration 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
our research and development efforts devoted to our product and process development projects changed from projects in to projects in and in as we have focused our research and development resources on fewer projects 
our internal research and development projects are typically completed in to months  and generally the costs associated with any single internal project during these periods were not material 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses including stock based compensation  hiring and training costs  consulting and service provider expenses including patent counsel related costs  marketing costs  occupancy related costs  depreciation and amortization expenses  and travel and relocation expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple element revenue arrangements asu to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of each element if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require a vendor to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
in april  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition related to milestones asu to provide updated guidance on accounting for revenue using the milestone method  clarifying that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model when applied to research or development arrangements 
we already applied a milestone method approach to our research or development arrangements 
we adopted the above accounting guidances on january   for applicable arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  the beginning of our fiscal year 
we have determined that adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the potential future impact of asu and asu will depend on the nature of any new arrangements or material modifications of existing arrangements that are entered into in the future 
revenues are recognized when the four basic revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  products have been delivered  transfer of technology has been completed or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents our primary sources of revenues consist of collaborative research and development agreements  product revenues and government grants 
collaborative research and development agreements typically provide us with multiple revenue streams  including up front fees for licensing  exclusivity and technology access  fees for full time employee equivalent fte services and the potential to earn milestone payments upon achievement of contractual criteria and royalty fees based on future product sales or cost savings by our customers 
our collaborative research and development revenues consist of revenues from shell and revenues from other customers with collaborative research and development agreements 
for each source of collaborative research and development revenues  product revenues and grant revenues  we apply the following revenue recognition criteria up front fees received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements  including license fees  technology access fees  and exclusivity fees  are deferred upon receipt  are not considered a separate unit of accounting and are recognized as revenues over the relevant performance periods 
revenues related to fte services are recognized as research services are performed over the related performance periods for each contract 
we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual reimbursement rate per fte working on the project 
when up front payments are combined with fte services in a single unit of accounting  we recognize the up front payments using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition based upon the actual amount of research and development labor hours incurred relative to the amount of the total expected labor hours to be incurred by us  up to the amount of cash received 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  we are required to make estimates of the total hours required to perform our obligations 
research and development expenses related to fte services under the collaborative research and development agreements approximate the research funding over the term of the respective agreements 
a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii results in additional payments being due to us 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone i is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms in the arrangement 
other payments received for which such payments are contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a collaborative partner s performance are recognized as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract terms and when such payments can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from royalties based on licensees sales of products using our technologies 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenues are recognized once passage of title and risk of loss has occurred and contractually specified acceptance criteria have been met  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have also been met 
product revenues consist of sales of biocatalysts  intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients and codex biocatalyst panels and kits 
cost of product revenues includes both internal and third party fixed and variable costs including amortization of purchased technology  materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs associated with our product revenues 

table of contents we license mutually agreed upon third party technology for use in our research and development collaboration with shell 
we record the license payments to research and development expense and offset related reimbursements received from shell 
these payments made by shell to us are direct reimbursements of our costs 
we account for these direct reimbursable costs as a net amount  whereby no expense or revenue is recorded for the costs reimbursed by shell 
for any payments not reimbursed by shell  we will recognize these as expenses in the statement of operations 
we elected to present the reimbursement from shell as a component of our research and development expense since presenting the receipt of payment from shell as revenues does not reflect the substance of the arrangement 
we receive payments from government entities in the form of government grants 
government grants are agreements that generally provide us with cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
revenues from government grants are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants were provided have been met and we have only perfunctory obligations outstanding 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenues 
shipping costs are included in our cost of product revenues 
such charges were not significant in any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to share based transactions  including the awarding of employee stock options and restricted stock units rsu  based on the estimated fair value of the awards granted 
we estimate the fair value of our stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
we calculate the estimated volatility rate based on selected companies in similar markets  due to a lack of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price 
we will continue to analyze the historical stock price volatility assumption as more historical data for our common stock becomes available 
due to our limited history of option activity  we calculate the expected life of options granted to employees using the simplified method permitted by the united states securities exchange commission  or sec  as the average of the total contractual term of the option and its vesting period 
the risk free rate assumption was based on us treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the terms of our stock options 
the expected dividend assumption was based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we account for stock options issued to non employees based on their estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the options granted to non employees is remeasured as they vest  and the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on at least an annual basis and test long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value  which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis 

table of contents we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair value 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated future cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
changes in estimated future cash flows could also result in a shortening of estimated useful life of long lived assets including intangibles for depreciation and amortization purposes 
income tax provision we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the future 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset in jurisdictions where ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not to occur 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes as required by the provisions of asc topic which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
the tax reform act of and similar state provisions limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards in certain situations where equity transactions result in a change of ownership as defined by internal revenue code section in the event we should experience an ownership change  as defined  utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards could be limited

our cash flows from operations will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase our headcount  primarily in research and development  in order to grow our business 
the timing of hiring of skilled research and development personnel affects cash flows in particular as there is a lag between the hiring of research and development personnel and the generation of collaboration or product revenues and cash flows from those personnel 
our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is cash receipts from our customers 
our largest uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures  rent payments  inventory purchases to support our revenue growth and non payroll research and development costs  which historically included payments made to maxygen in connection with our biofuels research and development collaboration with shell

accounting guidance update recently adopted accounting guidance in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income that eliminates the option to present items of other comprehensive income oci as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  and instead requires either  oci presentation and net income in a single continuous statement in the statement of operations  or as a separate statement of comprehensive income 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted this update in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon the achievement of milestone events 
an entity may only recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety in the period the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets certain criteria 
we adopted this guidance effective january  and it did not materially impact our financial statements 
the potential future impact of this guidance will depend on the nature of any new arrangements or material modifications of existing arrangements that are entered into in the future 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to our evaluation of revenue arrangements with milestones 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements 
this amended guidance requires disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and levels fair value measurements and disclosures about the purchase  sale  issuance and settlement activity of level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about the purchase  sale  issuance and settlement activity of level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the accounting guidance had no material impact to our financials or disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements updating accounting standards for revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the stated objective of the update was to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
the guidance provides amended methodologies for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands disclosure requirements 
we adopted this guidance for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures to date 
the potential future impact of this guidance will depend on the nature of any new arrangements or material modifications of existing arrangements that are entered into in the future 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to our evaluation of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
recent accounting guidance not yet effective in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment that simplifies goodwill impairment tests 
the new guidance states that a qualitative assessment may be performed to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
we will adopt this accounting standard upon its effective date for periods beginning after december   and do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss that clarifies and changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
among them is the clarification that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement  should only be applied when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
additionally  the new guidance requires quantitative information about unobservable inputs  and disclosure of the valuation processes used and narrative descriptions with regard to fair value measurements within the level categorization of the fair value hierarchy 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and are held for working capital purposes 
we had current and non current marketable securities holdings of million and million  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in corporate bonds  commercial paper  and us government obligations and us government sponsored enterprise securities and are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe we do not have material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates fell by in  our interest income would have declined by approximately  assuming consistent investment levels 
foreign currency risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  austria  france  germany  italy  japan and india  as well as research activities in countries outside the united states  including singapore and hungary 
as we expand internationally  our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  we purchase materials for  and pay employees at  our research facility in singapore in singapore dollars 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
