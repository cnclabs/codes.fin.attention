the following information contains forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
overview flowers foods currently operates two business segments a direct store delivery segment dsd segment and a warehouse delivery segment warehouse segment 
the dsd segment operates bakeries that market a wide variety of fresh bakery foods  including fresh breads  buns  rolls  tortillas  and snack cakes 
these products are sold through its dsd route delivery system to retail and foodservice customers in the southeast  mid atlantic  and southwest as well as in select markets in the northeast  california  and nevada 
the warehouse segment operates bakeries and produces snack cakes and breads and rolls that are shipped both fresh and frozen to national retail  foodservice  vending  and co pack customers through their warehouse channels 
we aim to achieve consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by focusing on improvement in the operating results of our existing businesses and  after detailed analysis  acquiring businesses and properties that add value to the company 
we believe this strategy will result in consistent and sustainable growth that will build value for our shareholders 
in may  the company acquired  through a wholly owned subsidiary  tasty 
tasty operates two bakeries in pennsylvania and serves customers primarily in the northeastern united states with an extensive line of tastykake branded snacks 
this acquisition strengthened our position in the branded snack cake category  facilitated our expansion into new geographic markets and increased our manufacturing capacity 

table of contents sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions  product line extensions  marketing and service 
we manage these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring our higher margin branded products  while using store branded products to absorb overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
sales for fiscal increased from fiscal this increase was primarily due to the tasty acquisition and increased pricing mix partially offset by lower volume 
during fiscal  we believe our sales were negatively impacted by the weakened economy  the competitive landscape and higher promotional activity within the baking industry 
while we expect sales to grow  we cannot guarantee at what level considering the current economic environment and competitive landscape in the baking industry 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  periodically experience price fluctuations  and  for that reason  we continually monitor the market for these commodities 
the cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation  weather conditions  domestic and international demand or other unforeseen circumstances 
agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels during and the first half of before declining during commodity prices began to rise in the second half of and continued rising during we anticipate our commodity costs to rise during we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices 
any decrease in the availability of these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly affect our earnings 
critical accounting estimates note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below which are used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  and pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records both direct and estimated 
table of contents reductions to gross revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
these allowances include price promotion discounts  coupons  customer rebates  cooperative advertising  and product returns 
price promotion discount expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales when the discounted product is sold to the customer 
coupon expense estimates are calculated and recorded as a reduction to gross sales using the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the required quantities to qualify for payment and are recorded as a reduction to gross sales 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded as a reduction to gross sales based on our portion of the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program 
product returns are recorded as a reduction to gross sales based on the actual returns in the week following the quarter end 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to as pbs 
the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs  and there has been a sharp increase in its use since that time 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and utilizes this technology with a majority of its larger retail customers such as walmart  kroger  food lion and winn dixie 
in fiscal the company recorded million in sales through pbs 
the company will continue to implement pbs technology for current pbs customers as they open new retail stores during in addition  new pbs customers will begin implementation during revenue on pbs sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
non pbs sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to certain commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting to manage the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
the company measures the fair value of its derivative portfolio using the fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market for that asset or liability 
when quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available  the company bases fair value on internally developed models that use current market observable inputs  such as exchange quoted futures prices and yield curves 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to long lived assets were recorded for fiscal years  or the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two step process 
the first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment  or reporting unit  with which the goodwill is associated 
this fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit  and if less than the carrying value  the goodwill is measured for potential impairment under step 
table of contents two 
under step two of this calculation  goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  determined in the same manner as a business combination  with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
our annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies incorporating market participant considerations and management s assumptions on revenue  revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates  and ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our estimates can significantly affect the outcome of the test 
we perform the fair value assessment using the income and market approach 
the market approach assumes growth rates for projected ebitda and revenue applied to market participant estimates of our enterprise value to ebitda and revenue 
the income approach estimates include our projected results of operations and our weighted average cost of capital as computed each quarter 
we use this data to complete a separate fair value analysis for each reporting unit 
changes in our forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates 
this test is performed in our fourth quarter unless circumstances require this analysis be completed sooner 
the income approach is tested using a sensitivity analysis to changes in the discount rate and yield a sufficient buffer to significant variances in our estimates 
the estimated fair values of our reporting segments exceeded our carrying values by over million in each segment 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for the fiscal years   or in connection with acquisitions  the company has acquired trademarks  customer lists and non compete agreements  which are intangible assets subject to amortization 
the company evaluates these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the undiscounted future cash flows of each intangible asset is compared to the carrying amount  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to amortizable intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years   or the company also owns trademarks acquired in acquisitions that are intangible assets not subject to amortization of million 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in addition  the assets are evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life 
the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to fair value 
the fair value is computed using the same approach described above for goodwill and includes the same risks and estimates 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets not subject to amortization were recorded for the fiscal years   or self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis and are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserve for uncertain tax benefits reflect our best assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the 
table of contents company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it more likely than not that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements that may impact the ultimate payment of such potential exposures 
while the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  the irs completed the audit of fiscal years and the results of the audit were immaterial  and the company is no longer subject to federal examination for years prior to pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations reflect key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans portfolios  past performance of these assets  the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  and other factors 
material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to experience different than assumed and changes in these assumptions 
future benefit obligations and annual pension costs could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
effective january   the company curtailed its largest defined benefit plan that covered the majority of its workforce 
benefits under this plan were frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under this plan 
the company continues to maintain another defined benefit plan that covers a small number of union employees 
effective august   the company assumed sponsorship of two defined benefit plans as part of the butterkrust acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
these plans were merged into the company s largest defined benefit plan at december  effective may   the company assumed sponsorship of three defined benefit plans as part of the tasty acquisition 
benefits under these plans are frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under these plans 
two of the tasty defined benefit plans are nonqualified plans covering former employees 
one of these nonqualified plans was terminated and all benefit obligations of the plan were settled effective december  the company recorded pension income of million for fiscal a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal pension cost by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return assumption would impact the company s fiscal pension cost by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
a quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
the company expects pension cost of approximately million for fiscal the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments to determine its discount rate 
the company uses a cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate 
the expected cash flows of each pension plan are matched to a yield curve based on aa graded bonds available in the marketplace at the measurement date 
a present value is developed  which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company considers the plan assets historical actual returns  targeted asset allocations  and the anticipated future economic environment and long term performance of individual asset classes  based on the company s investment strategy 
while appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance  the assumption 
table of contents represents management s best estimate of the long term prospective return 
based on these factors the long term rate of return assumption for the plans was set at for fiscal  as compared with the average annual return on the plans assets over the past years of approximately net of expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities  real estate  other diversifying strategies including  absolute return funds  hedged equity funds  and guaranteed insurance contracts  and short term investments and cash 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension costs do not include an explicit expense assumption and the return on assets rate reflects the long term expected return  net of expenses 
for the details of our pension plan assets  see note  postretirement plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its plans assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the expected average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plans 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of december  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
the company uses a calendar year end for the measurement date since the plans are based on a calendar year and because it approximates the company s fiscal year end 
amortization of this unrecognized loss during fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  the loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to acquisitions and the deconsolidation of the vie 
as a result of the deconsolidation  the company recorded million in right to use assets for certain trucks and trailers used for distributing our products from the manufacturing facilities to the distribution centers 
prior to fiscal and the deconsolidation of the vie  depreciation expense included only those assets not used in the distribution of the company s products 
as a result  depreciation of these assets increased over the prior year 

table of contents the dsd segment depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as the result of the vie deconsolidation and the recording of the right to use assets 
the warehouse segment depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as the result of increased depreciation expense due to the acquisitions that occurred during fiscal gain on acquisition 
on may   the company acquired substantially all the assets of a bakery mix operation in cedar rapids  iowa 
based on the purchase price allocation  the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the consideration paid 
as a result  we recognized a gain of million which is included in the line item gain on acquisition to derive income from operations in the consolidated statement of income 
we believe the gain on acquisition resulted from the seller s strategic intent to exit a non core business operation 
income from operations 
the increase in the dsd segment income from operations was attributable to significantly lower ingredient costs  partially offset by sales declines and higher workforce related expenses 
the decrease in the warehouse segment income from operations was primarily due to the gain on acquisition in the prior year discussed above  partially offset by higher store branded retail sales  lower distribution costs as a percent of sales  and the acquisitions 
the decrease in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily due to lower pension and postretirement plan costs 
net interest income 
the increase resulted from lower interest expense on the credit facility and term loans due to repayments made by the company 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to the increase in section qualifying production activities deduction and favorable discrete items recognized during the year  partially offset by the absence of non taxable earnings from the previously consolidated vie 
the difference in the effective rate and the statutory rate is primarily due to state income taxes and the section qualifying production activities deduction 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the company maintains a transportation agreement with an entity that transports a significant portion of the company s fresh bakery products from the company s production facilities to outlying distribution centers 
the company represents a significant portion of the entity s revenue 
this entity qualifies as a vie for reporting periods prior to january  under previous accounting guidance  and all the earnings of the vie were eliminated through noncontrolling interest because the company did not have an equity ownership interest in the vie 
in  the fasb amended the consolidation principles associated with vie accounting by replacing the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in the vie with a qualitative approach 
the qualitative approach is focused on identifying which company has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
as a result of this qualitative analysis  the company was no longer required to consolidate the vie beginning on january  at adoption 
see note  variable interest entity  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional disclosure 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments as well as our ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist primarily of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives 
currently  the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the company s strategy for use of its cash flow includes paying dividends to shareholders  making acquisitions  growing internally and repurchasing shares of its common stock  when appropriate 
the company leases certain property and equipment under various operating and capital lease arrangements

distributor arrangements 
the company offers long term financing to independent distributors for the purchase of their territories  and a vast majority of the independent distributors elect to use this financing alternative 
the distributor notes generally have terms of up to ten years  and the distributors pay principal and interest weekly 
a majority of the independent distributors have the right to require the company to repurchase the territories and trucks  if applicable  at the original price paid by the distributor on the long term financing arrangement in the six month period following the sale of a territory to the independent distributor 
if the truck is leased  the company will assume the lease payment if the territory is repurchased during the first six month period 
if the company had been required to repurchase these territories  the company would have been obligated to pay million and million as of december  and january   respectively 
after the six month period expires  the company retains a right of first refusal to repurchase these territories

the company has 
table of contents approximately million and million as of december  and as of january   respectively  of territories held for sale 
the increase was primarily the result of higher turnover for expansion market distributor territories  certain routes that were repurchased for route restructuring  and the territories held for sale from the tasty acquisition

in the past we provided third party guarantees for certain truck leases 
this is not the company s policy today 
the company has guaranteed  through their respective terms in older arrangements  approximately million and million in leases at december  and january   respectively  that certain independent distributors have entered into with third party financial institutions related to distribution vehicle financing 
in the ordinary course of business  when an independent distributor terminates its relationship with the company  the company  although not legally obligated  generally purchases and operates that territory utilizing the truck of the former distributor 
to accomplish this  the company operates the truck for the distributor  who generally remains solely liable under the original truck lease to the third party lessor  and continues the payments on behalf of the former distributor 
once the territory is resold to an independent distributor  the truck lease is assumed by the new independent distributor 
at december  and january   the company operated and territories with truck leases  respectively 
assuming the company does not resell these territories to new independent distributors  at december  and january   the maximum obligation associated with these truck leases was approximately million and million  respectively

table of contents guarantees and indemnification obligations 
our company has provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in various agreements with customers  suppliers and other parties  as well as in agreements to sell business assets or lease facilities 
in general  these provisions indemnify the counterparty for matters such as breaches of representations and warranties  certain environmental conditions and tax matters  and  in the context of sales of business assets  any liabilities arising prior to the closing of the transactions 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of any potential claims 
we do not believe that any of these commitments will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may  the fasb issued an accounting standard that creates consistency between gaap and international financial reporting standards on the definition of fair value and on the guidance on how to measure fair value and on what to disclose about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective to the company beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal and is to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides companies with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting units is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the impairment loss 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance in our fiscal to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance for offsetting netting assets and liabilities 
this guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
this includes derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
these disclosures allow users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
these requirements are retrospective for all comparative periods 
we are still analyzing the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to delay the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for other comprehensive income and the effect of those reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements where net income is presented  by component of net income  and on the face of the financial statements where other comprehensive income is presented  and by component of other comprehensive income 
the fasb did not delay the requirements for the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income that was in place before the original amendment was issued in june  and which we early adopted 
the amendments are effective for public entities for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but it will change the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
information regarding non gaap financial measures the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  from time to time  the company may present in its public statements  press releases and sec filings  non gaap financial 
table of contents measures such as  ebitda  gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization  and adjusted operating income to measure the performance of the company and its operating divisions 
ebitda is used as the primary performance measure in the company s annual executive bonus plan 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and income attributable to non controlling interest 
the company believes that ebitda is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company s ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow 
furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because ebitda measures assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non operating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income includes costs that we consider important to present to investors 
these include  but are not limited to  the costs of closing a plant or costs associated with merger related activities 
we believe that financial information excluding certain gaap transactions not considered to be part of the ongoing business improves the comparability of earnings results 
we believe investors will be able to better understand our earnings results if these transactions are excluded from the results 
these non gaap financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states and should be considered in addition to  not in lieu of  gaap reported measures 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap 
our method of calculating ebitda and adjusted ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies  and  accordingly  our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is used as a performance measure to provide additional transparent information regarding our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis 
changes in depreciation and amortization are separately discussed and include depreciation and amortization for materials  supplies  labor and other production costs and operating activities 
presentation of gross margin includes depreciation and amortization in the materials  supplies  labor and other production costs according to gaap 
our method of presenting gross margin excludes the depreciation and amortization components  as discussed above 
this presentation may differ from the methods used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
our website has the documents that provide a reconciliation of our net income  the most comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  a reconciliation of our gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization to gaap gross margin  a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to gaap earnings per share  a reconciliation of free cash flow to gaap operating cash flow  adjusted ebitda to gaap operating cash flow  and a reconciliation of gaap operating income to adjusted operating income
