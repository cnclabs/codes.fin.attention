item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview inuvo  inc and subsidiaries we  us  or our is an internet marketing technology business with two segments performance marketing  and web properties 
in  management reorganized our operations along two new operating segments performance marketing and web properties 
prior to  our segments were classified as exchange and direct segments 
the performance marketing segment designs  builds  implements  manages and sells the various technology platforms and services we offer 
the performance marketing segment consolidates the disparate platforms we acquired between and  resulting in a single technology foundation which can serve the needs of advertiser and publisher clients within this segment 
this foundation is referred to as the inuvo platform 
the inuvo platform is an open  quality controlled  lead generation marketplace designed to allow advertisers and publishers the ability to manage their consumer marketing transactions in an automated and transparent environment 
in addition to the core inuvo platform for advertisers and publishers  we continue to sell services and license legacy platforms or directories within the performance marketing segment 
revenue is principally generated when a consumer clicks on links  fills out a lead form or purchases a product 
in this segment  we must attract highly visited web publishers where competition for advertising space is driven primarily by the amount paid for each offer presented on each page viewed 
we believe that greater transparency and alignment between advertisers and publishers  combined with sophisticated analytic technologies that predict fraud and target offers more effectively  will differentiate service providers in this marketplace 
the web properties segment designs  builds and manages unique offers and or websites that generate revenue principally from the sale of products  leads and or advertising 
the web properties segment manages owned and operated websites across verticals that include local search  product shopping comparison  pre post natal interests 
the segment uses a number of online tactics designed to drive traffic to these owned and operated sites including search  affiliates  email and display marketing campaigns 
in the future  we expect that a majority of such tactics will be deployed and or tracked via the inuvo platform 
in october  we brought to market the inuvo platform 
within this solution  advertisers create and manage advertising campaigns  web publishers better monetize their available advertising inventory  and strategic partners and web developers have the ability to customize implementations through an application programming interface 
we believe a very important by product of the our business is the information produced both on the advertiser side  where we analyze what kind of products convert  and on the publisher side  where it analyzes what kind of websites consumers have interests in 
this business intelligence allows for improved detection of fraudulent transactions and higher advertising response rates 
as described later in this section  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a reduction in search marketing revenue resulting from our migration to the recently launched yahoo bing platform 
while we have made adjustments to adapt to this new marketplace  we continued to experience volatility in volumes and revenue through the third quarter of as a result  our operations and liquidity have been adversely impacted 
effective with the completion of the merger in march with vertro  the percentage of our revenue sourced from yahoo bing will be greatly reduced 
in the third quarter of  we launched bargainmatch and kowabunga 
bargainmatch  an owned and operated website in the web properties segment  is our comparative shopping site that rewards consumer loyalty by providing cashback on the purchase of products 
bargainmatch has an extensive panel of retailers that offer cash incentives for purchases across a large list of skus 
retailers determine how much they will pay for a customer purchase 
we take a share of the transaction and set aside the cashback portion for customers 
kowabunga is a daily deal program 
we have access to millions of consumers through our search marketing operations that are potential customers for a local deal of the day 
we have partnered with a national direct marketer  which currently markets offers from hundreds of thousands of merchants in rural america 
we developed the infrastructure to present daily local offers from the inventory of its partner to the consumers from our platform 
subsequent events on march   we completed our acquisition of vertro  inc vertro  an internet company that owns and operates the alot product portfolio 
vertro s operations are now part of our web properties segment 
in evaluating the merger  we  and the management of vertro  believed that the combination could create a stronger  more scalable business from which to attract advertisers  publishers and consumers 
we also expect that the combination will allow for the elimination of approximately million in overlapping operating and public company annual expenses 
other expected benefits include diversified revenue streams which will mitigate our dependence on one major customer  an existing install and distribution capability through vertro s alot toolbar applications for our consumer facing innovations  a stronger business from which to access both debt and capital markets to support growth  and the combination of two experienced digital marketing teams 
we are in the early stages of integrating the operations of the two companies 
nyse amex on may   we received notice from the nyse amex that we were below certain of the exchange s continued listing standards due to stockholders equity of less than million and losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years as set forth in section a ii of the nyse amex company guide 
the exchange accepted our plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards and in june we executed the first part of the plan by raising million in equity 
another key component of the plan was the launching of new marketing initiatives  bargainmatch and kowabunga  that we believed would enhance revenues and income in the next months 
however  following the closing of the merger with vertro  our stockholders equity then exceeded the minimum requirement of the exchange and we regained compliance with the continued listing standards 
the exchange has advised us it will monitor our continued compliance for several quarters as we integrate vertro s operations into our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting practices gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  goodwill and amortizable intangibles  certain stock based compensation and income taxes  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition general asc 
under asc  we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the following principles with respect to our different business services performance marketing segment affiliate network consistent with the provisions asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations asc we recognize revenue as an agent in affiliate marketing transactions in which we are not the primary obligor 
accordingly  service fee revenue is recognized on a net basis because any affiliate expenses are the responsibility of our advertising customer 
in certain instances we assume the position of primary obligor and thus recognize revenue on a gross basis 
revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 
search network in accordance with asc we record as revenue the gross amount received from advertisers and the amount paid to the publishers placing the advertisements as cost of revenue 
revenue from our company owned networks is based on a per click basis and is recognized once the action is taken 
affiliate software we recognize revenue the month in which the software is utilized 
customers are invoiced on the first of the month for the monthly services 
all overages for the month are billed at the end of the month and are included in unbilled revenue 
hosting arrangements we recognize revenue through a monthly hosting fee and additional usage fees as provided 
web properties segment online membership income we recognize revenue from online membership revenue when payment is received and the service date of providing membership benefits has taken place 
lead sales for lead sales  our revenue recognition varies depending on the arrangement with the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for delivery only  revenue is recognized when the lead information is provided to the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for compensation based on sales generated by the purchaser from the lead  we recognize revenue in the period that the purchasing company makes a sale that was derived from the lead we provided 
list management services substantially all of our revenue is recorded at the net amount of its gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a customer 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to customers exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses 
in compliance with asc  we assess whether we or a third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we have evaluated the terms of our customer agreements and considered other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor as part of this assessment 
accordingly  we generally record revenue net of pass through charges 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record our accounts receivable based upon the invoiced amount and they are considered past due when full payment is not received by the specified credit terms 
we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon those estimates 
the allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the gross profit approach methodology of valuation that includes the undiscounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets  which result from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
tradenames are not amortized as they are believed to have an indefinite life 
tradenames are reviewed annually for impairment under asc for the year ended december   we had impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million as a result of exiting our call center activities 
in  we wrote off  of tradenames as part of the sales of real estate school online and recorded an impairment loss of  associated with the morex and primary ads tradenames 
deferred taxes we reserve for federal and state income taxes on items included in our consolidated statements of operations regardless of the period when the taxes are payable 
deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in evaluating our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we must project future levels of taxable income 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we examine the evidence related to a recent history of tax losses  the economic conditions in which we operate  recent organizational changes  and our forecasts and projections 
as a result  we were unable to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that any of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we therefore recorded a full reserve for the net deferred tax asset 
we have adopted certain provisions of asc income taxes 
this statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
stock awards and stock based compensation we value stock compensation based on the fair value recognition provisions asc  compensation stock compensation  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of option grants over the requisite employee service period 
during the year ended december   our executive officers  certain of our senior management and our board of directors  voluntarily elected to defer a portion of their compensation 
the amount of the deferred compensation was approximately  as an incentive for officers  management and directors to participate in the elected deferrals  we granted them rsas with a fair value equal to the amount of the deferred compensation 
the rsas will vest upon the earlier of payment of the deferred compensation or one year from the date of grant 
the number of rsas granted in conjunction with the deferred compensation program was  for the year ended december  and were granted at an exercise price ranging from per share to per share on the date of each grant 
as of december   none of the shares of restricted stock granted in connection with these elected deferrals were issued 
in  we issued  shares of our common stock valued at approximately  to our executive officers and certain of our senior management in lieu of cash compensation 
the value of the shares equaled the fair market value of our common stock on the date of issuance 
the recipients were accredited or otherwise sophisticated individuals who had such knowledge and experience in business matters that they were capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in our securities 
the recipients had access to business and financial information concerning our company 
the securities were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  please see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which appears elsewhere in this report 
results of operations overview of net revenues decreased for the year ended compared to this decline in revenue is due primarily to the decrease in revenue in our search revenue due to the volatility from the yahoo bing migration and due to exiting of the telemarketing business 
gross profit decreased by in when compared to  while our gross margins increased over percentage points 
the decrease in gross profit was also primarily due to the exiting of the telemarketing activity and the impact of the yahoo bing migration 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a higher percentage of our revenue coming from our web properties segment largely driven by traffic through our owned and operated websites that historically have higher gross margins 
in the year ended  our operating expenses decreased by approximately million over the same period in due primarily to an increase in search spend of approximately million offset by decreases in compensation  telemarketing fees and other selling  general and administrative expenses as management continues to manage these costs 
our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended increased by approximately million from the same period in due to higher operating expenses driven lower revenue and gross profit impacted by higher search costs driving traffic to our owned and operated websites and no corresponding reduction of other costs 
during  we incurred an expense of approximately  associated with two litigation settlements

net revenue total net revenue from our performance marketing and web properties segments for and were as follows in thousands year ended december  of revenue of revenue change change performance marketing web properties total net revenue net revenue from our performance marketing segment decreased over last year primarily due to the decrease in the number of transactions driven through third party affiliates 
we serve hundreds of thousands of individual advertisers within the business 
access to those advertisers comes principally through our relationship with a top three search engine 
for and  and of our net revenue in our performance marketing segment was attributable to this relationship 
as described elsewhere herein  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a reduction in search marketing revenue resulting from the migration to the recently launched yahoo bing platform 
while we have made adjustments to adapt to this new marketplace we continue to experience instability in our revenue streams 
additionally  we expect our reliance on the foregoing customer to be material going forward  however  the reliance is partially mitigated by our vertro acquisition whose primary business is materially reliant on a different search engine and customer base 
the decline in net revenue from our web properties segment of in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease of million decrease in revenue from our babytobee business partially offset by an increase in revenue from our owned and operated websites of approximately million 
net revenue from our babytobee business was approximately million in as compared to approximately million for this decrease of was primarily due to a decline in lead volumes and lower revenue as a result of exiting the telesales component of the business in june additionally  our web properties segment was negatively impacted by a chargeback of approximately million for advertiser refunds due to traffic irregularities from sources we believe we have located and removed 
we believe that the revenue trends described above for the performance marketing segment will continue as we focus our marketing to our owned and operated websites 
however  as we expand our product offerings in our web properties business in and integrate vertro s operations into this segment  we expect that the web properties segment revenue will increase 
cost of revenue and gross profit cost of revenue  which includes affiliate payments  data acquisition amortization  merchant processing fees and product costs  were as follows in thousands year ended december  of revenue of revenue change affiliate expenses data acquisition merchant processing fees and product costs total cost of revenue the lower affiliate payments in as a percentage of revenue compared to the same period in is due to a higher percentage of search transactions with our owned and operated websites 
we anticipate that these costs will continue to increase in dollar amounts as revenue from the inuvo platform and our search network increases but to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we focus on managing the revenue generated from our owned and operated websites 
the decrease in data acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue in compared to is due primarily to email distribution costs tied to our web properties segment as revenue from our babytobee website has decreased over this same period 
consistent with the changes in our net revenues and cost of revenues described above  our gross margin increased to during from in this increase in margin is due to the increasing percentage of revenue derived from owned and operated websites

gross margin in our web properties segment for and was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in margin in the web properties segment is due to the relatively fixed nature of our direct costs in this segment which was impacted by the lower revenue and the chargeback noted above 
operating expenses operating expenses  which consist of search costs  compensation and telemarketing and selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows in thousands year ended december  of revenue of revenue change change search costs compensation and telemarketing selling  general and administrative total operating expenses this increase in search costs of approximately million is a result of our strategic initiative to drive revenue generating traffic to our owned and operated web sites as noted above

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million in from is due primarily to a reduction in accounting  legal and consulting costs of approximately  related to the restatements of prior year financial statements during  a decline in depreciation and amortization of approximately  due to a reduction in our capital spending over the past few years  a reduction of bad debt expense of approximately  due to improved collection and  for litigation accruals

as a result of the vertro acquisition  we anticipate many overlapping public company and third party expenses between the separate companies will be eliminated 
the combined operations are expected to achieve greater than million annually in savings from elimination of such overlapping costs 
other income expense other income expense includes net interest expense  impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets  loss on sale of property and equipment  and litigation settlements 
net interest expense  which is related to our borrowings from bridge bank  na and wachovia bank  na decreased by approximately  or during as compared to this decrease in interest expense reflects a decrease in interest rates and the reduction of our overall debt with bridge bank and wachovia

the loss from discontinued operations in was approximately  and is primarily attributed to the loss on the sale of msa of approximately million offset by the gain on the sale of reso of  and further reduced by an operating income of approximately  as of december   we sold all of our discontinued operations 
as part of the sale of reso  we also wrote off tradenames in the amount of  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the company s needs for cash 
at december  and december   we had working capital deficits of approximately million and million  respectively 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  cash on hand and the bank credit facility 
while we do not have any commitments for capital expenditures which come due within the next months  our liquidity has been negatively affected throughout  as a result of a reduction in search marketing revenue resulting from the migration by yahoo to the bing platform in the fall of the integration of these two platforms caused both an unexpected disruption in search traffic purchased through the yahoo bing platform and lower revenue per click received from the yahoo bing platform 
we have made adjustments to adapt to this new marketplace  but we continue to experience volatility in revenue that may continue in the future 
in response  we implemented a cost reduction plan during the first quarter of to offset the reduced revenue which included a reduction in employees and related expenses which resulted in monthly savings of  beginning in february we have also delayed payments to publishers and vendors in the management of our cash flows 
extending these payments may affect the decision of publishers and vendors to do business with inuvo 
in september  in order to further reduce our operating costs  we eliminated an additional full time positions and six part time positions 
the effect of this reduction in personnel was approximately  monthly 
additionally in  our directors  executive officers and certain senior managers agreed to a deferral of cash compensation for approximately  in the first quarter of  we favorably renegotiated the outsourced call center contract reducing the monthly cost outlay of over  monthly and in the second quarter we decided to terminate the outsourcing agreement entirely
