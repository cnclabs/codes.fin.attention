the discussion may contain certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are those that are not historical in nature 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
executive summary we are a commercial real estate company that acquires  manages  and finances  directly or through our subsidiaries  commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt  commercial real property  commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  other commercial real estate related assets and agency residential mortgage backed securities 
we expect that the commercial real estate loans we acquire will be fixed and floating rate first mortgage loans secured by commercial properties 
we may also acquire subordinated commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans 
we also engage in long term sale leaseback and build to suit transactions for companies in the us we also intend to engage in these transactions in europe 
we purchase commercial properties that are triple net leased to corporate tenants 
the triple net leases require that in sale leaseback transactions  each tenant pays substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property  including real estate taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance and capital expenditures 
from time to time  we also acquire commercial real property as part of our resolution of commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt where a borrower defaults in their obligations and we take title to the collateral underlying the commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt through foreclosure or other means 
we acquire cmbs which are rated aaa through bbb as well as cmbs that are below investment grade or are non rated 
the other commercial real estate related securities and other commercial real estate asset classes consist of debt and equity tranches of commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations  or cre cdos  loans to real estate companies including real estate investment trusts  or reits  and real estate operating companies  or reocs  commercial real estate securities and commercial real property 
in addition  we acquire residential mortgage backed securities  or rmbs  for which a us government agency such as ginnie mae  or a federally chartered corporation such as fannie mae and freddie mac  guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities 
we refer to these securities as agency rmbs 
we refer to ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac collectively as the agencies 
we are externally managed by fixed income discount advisory company  which we refer to as fidac 
fidac is a wholly owned subsidiary of annaly capital management  inc we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending on december  our targeted asset classes and the principal investments we expect to make in each include commercial mortgage loans  consisting of o a notes and other first mortgage loans that are secured by commercial and multifamily properties o construction loans subordinated debt o b notes  c notes  and other subordinated notes o mezzanine loans o loan participations o preferred equity commercial real property o office buildings o hotels o retail o industrial o multifamily o residential condominiums o other commercial real property including land commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  consisting of o cmbs rated aaa through bbb o cmbs that are rated below investment grade or are non rated other commercial real estate assets  consisting of o debt and equity tranches of cre cdos o loans to real estate companies including reits and reocs o commercial real estate securities agency rmbs o single family residential mortgage pass through certificates representing interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by residential real property where payments of both interest and principal are guaranteed by a us government agency or federally chartered corporation our principal business objective is to capitalize on the fundamental changes that have occurred and are occurring in the commercial real estate finance industry to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long term  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
in order to capitalize on the changing sets of opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle  we may expand or refocus our strategy by emphasizing assets in different parts of the capital structure and different real estate sectors 
we expect to continue to deploy our capital through the origination and acquisition of commercial first mortgage loans  cmbs  mezzanine financings and other commercial real estate debt instruments at attractive risk adjusted yields as well as directly in commercial real property  and cmbs and agency rmbs 
we expect to allocate our capital within our targeted asset classes opportunistically based upon our manager s assessment of the risk reward profiles of particular assets 
our strategy may be amended from time to time  if recommended by our manager and approved by our board of directors 
if we amend our asset strategy  we are not required to seek stockholder approval 
we expect that over the near term our investment portfolio will be weighted toward commercial real estate loans and other commercial real estate debt and commercial real property  subject to maintaining our reit qualification and our act exemption 
we use borrowings as part of our financing strategy 
we have financed our triple net lease portfolio with non recourse financings  which generally limit the recoverability of the loan to the property 
these financings may be specific to a particular property or secured by a portfolio of our properties 
we anticipate that the loan to value ratio for these financing will be between and but would likely not exceed 
although we are not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio  the amount of leverage we incur is determined by our manager  taking into account a variety of factors  which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our portfolio  the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio  the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities  including hedges  the availability and cost of financing our assets  the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties  the health of the us economy and commercial and residential mortgage markets  the outlook for the level  slope  and volatility of interest rate movement  the credit quality of our target assets and the collateral underlying our target assets 
we may enhance the returns on our commercial mortgage loan assets  especially loan acquisitions  through securitizations 
we may also sell the senior portion or a note and retain the subordinate or junior position in a b note or other subordinate loan 
if possible  we may securitize the senior portion  expected to be equivalent to investment grade rated cmbs  while retaining the subordinate securities in our portfolio 
we use repurchase agreements to finance acquisitions of agency rmbs with a number of counterparties 
we expect to leverage our triple net lease investments 
in the future  we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our targeted assets  including warehouse facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing 
we may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities to fund our future asset acquisitions 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  we may  from time to time  utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates and its effects on our asset valuations 
we also may engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate changes in interest rates or other potential influences on the values of our assets 
we may attempt to reduce interest rate risk and to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of match funded financing structures  when appropriate 
we expect these instruments will allow us to minimize  but not eliminate  the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities before the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings 
factors impacting our operating results in addition to the prevailing market conditions  our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  commercial mortgage loans  commercial real estate debt  cmbs and other financial assets in the marketplace 
our net interest income includes the actual payments we receive and is also impacted by the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts 
our net interest income varies over time  primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  and with respect to agency rmbs we own prepayment rates and prepayment speeds as measured by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  on our cmbs and agency rmbs assets 
interest rates and prepayment rates vary according to the type of asset  conditions in the financial markets  credit worthiness of our borrowers  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are held directly by us or are included in our cmbs 
change in fair value of our assets 
it is our business strategy to hold our targeted assets as long term investments 
as such  we expect that our cmbs and agency rmbs will be carried at their fair value  as available for sale securities in accordance with asc investments in debt and equity securities  with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
as a result  we do not expect that changes in the fair value of the assets will normally impact our operating results 
at least on a quarterly basis  however  we will assess both our ability and intent to continue to hold such assets as long term investments 
as part of this process  we will monitor our targeted assets for other than temporary impairment  or otti  including otti attributable to credit losses 
a change in our ability or intent to continue to hold any of our investment securities could result in our recognizing an impairment charge or realizing losses upon the sale of such securities 
credit risk 
we may be exposed to various levels of credit risk depending on the nature of our investments and the nature and level of the assets underlying the investments and credit enhancements  if any  supporting our assets 
fidac and fidac s investment committee approve and monitor credit risk and other risks associated with each investment 
we review loan to value metrics upon either the origination or the acquisition of a new investment but generally not in the course of quarterly surveillance 
we generally review the most recent financial information produced by the borrower  net operating income  or noi  debt service coverage ratios  or dscr  property debt yields net cash flow or noi divided by the amount of outstanding indebtedness  loan per unit and rent rolls relating to each of our assets  and may consider other factors we deem important 
we review market pricing to determine the refinance ability of the asset 
we review economic trends  both macro as well as those directly affecting the property  and the supply and demand of competing projects in the sub market in which the subject property is located 
we also evaluate the borrower s ability to manage and operate the properties 
based on upon the review  loans are assigned an internal rating of performing loans  watch list loans or workout loans 
loans that are deemed performing loans meet all present contractual obligations 
watch list loans are defined as performing loans but whose timing and or recovery of investment may be under review 
workout loans are defined as those either not performing or we do not expect to recover our cost basis 
size of portfolio 
the size of our portfolio  as measured by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans and aggregate principal balance of our mortgage related securities and the other assets we own is also a key revenue driver 
generally  as the size of our portfolio grows  the amount of interest income we receive increases 
the larger portfolio  however  may drive increased expenses if we incur additional interest expense to finance the purchase of our assets 
changes in market interest rates 
with respect to our business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase  the value of our mortgage loans  cmbs and agency rmbs  to decline  coupons on our adjustable rate mortgage loans  cmbs and agency rmbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates  to the extent applicable under the terms of our investments  prepayments on our mortgage loan portfolio  cmbs and agency rmbs to slow  thereby slowing the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts  and to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy  the value of these agreements to increase 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause to the extent applicable under the terms of our investments  prepayments on our mortgage loan  cmbs and agency rmbs portfolio to increase  thereby accelerating the amortization of our purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts  the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease  the value of our mortgage loan  cmbs and agency rmbs portfolio to increase  to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy  the value of these agreements to decrease  and coupons on our adjustable rate mortgage loans  cmbs and agency rmbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for probable credit losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowances for loan losses balance on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of evaluating each loan as follows we review loan to value metrics upon either the origination or the acquisition of a new asset 
we generally review the most recent financial information produced by the borrower  net operating income noi  debt service coverage ratios dscr  property debt yields net cash flow or noi divided by the amount of outstanding indebtedness  loan per unit and rent rolls relating to each of its assets  and may consider other factors it deems important 
we review market pricing to determine the ability to refinance the asset 
we review economic trends  both macro as well as those directly affecting the property  and the supply and demand of competing projects in the sub market in which the subject property is located 
we also evaluate the borrower s ability to manage and operate the properties 
we generally do not review loan to value metrics on a quarterly basis 
loans are assigned an internal rating of performing loans  watch list loans or workout loans 
performing loans meet all present contractual obligations 
watch list loans are defined as performing loans for which the timing of cost recovery is under review 
workout loans are defined as loans that are either not performing or we do not expect to recover its cost basis 
in addition  we evaluate the entire portfolio to determine whether a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio is necessary 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
we charge off the collateral deficiency on all loans at days past due and  as a result  no specific valuation allowance was maintained at december  the expense for probable credit losses in connection with mortgage loans is the charge to earnings to increase the allowance for probable credit losses to the level that management estimates to be adequate considering delinquencies  loss experience and collateral quality 
other factors considered relate to geographic trends and product diversification  the size of the portfolio and current economic conditions 
based upon these factors  we will establish the provision for probable credit losses by category of asset 
when it is probable that we will be unable to collect the lesser of all amounts contractually due or the estimated terminal value on loans purchased at a discount  the account is considered impaired 
where impairment is indicated  a valuation write down or write off will be measured based upon the excess of the recorded investment amount over the net fair value of the collateral  as reduced by selling costs 
any deficiency between the carrying amount of an asset and the net sales price of repossessed collateral will be charged to the allowance for loan losses 
revenue recognition interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the securities or loans and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the securities or loans are amortized into interest income over the projected lives of the securities or loans using the effective interest method based on the estimated recovery value 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the internal revenue code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income  if any  to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will then be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for us federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the internal revenue service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distributions to stockholders 
however  we believe that we will be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit and we intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner so that we will qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
we may  however  be subject to certain state and local taxes and our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local taxes

the yield on our portfolio  excluding cash  was  and for the years ended december  and and the period commencing september  through december   respectively

liquidity and capital resources liquidity measures our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain our assets and operations  make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we will use significant cash to purchase our targeted assets  repay principal and interest on our borrowings  make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations 
our primary sources of cash will generally consist of the net proceeds equity offerings  payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets  cash generated from our operating results and unused borrowing capacity under our financing sources 
we have financed our triple net lease portfolio with non recourse financings  which generally limit the recoverability of the loan to the property 
these financings will be specific to a particular property or secured by a portfolio of our properties 
we anticipate that the loan to value ratio for these financing will be between and but would likely not exceed 
we intend to utilize structural leverage through securitizations of commercial real estate loans or cmbs 
we will  however  also seek to finance the acquisition of agency rmbs using repurchase agreements with counterparties  which are recourse 
with regard to securitizations or selling the senior portion of the loan  the leverage will depend on the market conditions for structuring such transactions 
we anticipate that leverage for agency rmbs would be available to us  which would provide for a debt to equity ratio in the range of to but would likely not exceed based on current market conditions  we expect to operate within the leverage levels described above in the near and long term 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  or not at all 
securitizations we intend to seek to enhance the returns on our commercial mortgage loan investments  especially loan acquisitions  through securitization 
if available  we intend to securitize the senior portion  expected to be equivalent to aaa rated cmbs  while retaining the subordinate securities in our portfolio 
other sources of financing we expect to use repurchase agreements to finance acquisitions of agency rmbs with a number of counterparties 
in the future  we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our targeted assets  including warehouse facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing 
we may also sell the senior portion or a note and retain the subordinate or junior position in a b note or other subordinate loan 
we may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future asset acquisitions 
for our short term one year or less and long term liquidity  which include investing and compliance with collateralization requirements under our repurchase agreements if the pledged collateral decreases in value or in the event of margin calls created by prepayments of the pledged collateral  we also rely on the cash flow from investments  primarily monthly principal and interest payments to be received on our cmbs and mortgage loans  cash flow from the sale of securities as well as any primary securities offerings authorized by our board of directors 
based on our current portfolio  leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements  we believe our assets will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements such as to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to stockholders and pay general corporate expenses 
however  a decline in the value of our collateral or an increase in prepayment rates substantially above our expectations could cause a temporary liquidity shortfall due to the timing of the necessary margin calls on the financing arrangements and the actual receipt of the cash related to principal pay downs 
if our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may have to sell debt or additional equity securities in a common stock offering 
if required  the sale of cmbs or mortgage loans at prices lower than their carrying value would result in losses and reduced income 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital 
subject to our maintaining our qualification as a reit  we expect to use a number of sources to finance our investments  including repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities  securitization  commercial paper and term financing cdos 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
our operating activities provided net cash of approximately million for the year ended december  and proceeds of million for the year ended december  our investing activities used net cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily for the purchase of investments 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of net proceeds of million including our common stock offering and a million dollar loan 
our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of net proceeds of million from our secured financing agreement with the federal reserve bank of new york  or frbny 
at december   and  our financing agreements of million  million and million  respectively  had remaining maturities of greater than days 
we are not required to maintain any specific debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets 
at december  our total recourse debt was approximately million which represented a debt to equity ratio of approximately as compared to december  our total debt was approximately million which represented a debt to equity ratio of approximately stockholders equity our charter provides that we may issue up to  shares of stock  consisting of up to  shares of common stock having a par value of per share and up to  shares of preferred stock having a par value of per share 
on march   we announced the sale of  shares of common stock at per share for estimated proceeds  less the underwriters discount and offering expenses  of million 
concurrently with the sale of these shares annaly purchased  shares at the same price per share as the public offering  for proceeds of approximately million 
these sales settled on april  on april   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share for estimated proceeds  less the underwriters discount and offering expenses  of million 
in total  we raised net proceeds of approximately million in these offerings 
there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding as of december   and  respectively 
related party transactions management agreement we have entered into a management agreement with fidac  pursuant to which fidac is entitled to receive a management fee and  in certain circumstances  a termination fee and reimbursement of certain expenses as described in the management agreement 
such fees and expenses do not have fixed payments 
the management fee is payable quarterly in arrears  and currently is per annum  of our stockholders equity as defined in the management agreement 
fidac uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who  notwithstanding that certain of them also are our officers  receive no cash compensation directly from us 
upon termination without cause  we will pay fidac a termination fee 
we may also terminate the management agreement with days prior notice from our board of directors  without payment of a termination fee  for cause or upon a change of control of annaly or fidac  each as defined in the management agreement 
fidac may terminate the management agreement if we or any of our subsidiaries become required to register as an investment company under the act  with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event  in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee 
fidac may also decline to renew the management agreement by providing us with days written notice  in which case we would not be required to pay a termination fee 
we are obligated to reimburse fidac for its costs incurred under the management agreement 
in addition  the management agreement permits fidac to require us to pay for our pro rata portion of rent  telephone  utilities  office furniture  equipment  machinery and other office  internal and overhead expenses of fidac incurred in our operation 
these expenses are allocated between fidac and us based on the ratio of our proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets managed by fidac as calculated at each quarter end 
we and fidac will modify this allocation methodology  subject to our board of directors approval if the allocation becomes inequitable ie  if we become very highly leveraged compared to fidac s other funds and accounts 
fidac has waived its right to request reimbursement from us of these expenses until such time as it determines to rescind that waiver 
purchases of common stock by affiliates annaly purchased  shares at per share for estimated proceeds of approximately million 
this purchase settled on april  as of december   annaly owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
restricted stock grants there were no stock grants for the years ended december  and clearing fees we use rcap securities inc  or rcap  a sec registered broker dealer and a wholly owned subsidiary of annaly  to clear trades for us and rcap receives to customary market based fees and charges arising from such services 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december  we financed a portion of our real estate purchase with a recourse loan 
as of december  we financed our cmbs portfolio with non recourse financings under the talf

the performance hurdle rate will be met if during any full four calendar quarter period during the full calendar quarters after the consummation of our initial public offering our core earnings for any such four quarter period exceeds the product of x the weighted average of the issue price per share of all public offerings of our common stock  multiplied by the weighted average number of shares outstanding including any restricted stock units  any restricted shares of common stock and any other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans in such four quarter period and y 
core earnings is a non gaap measure and is defined as gaap net income loss excluding non cash equity compensation expense  depreciation and amortization to the extent that we foreclose on any properties underlying our target assets  any unrealized gains  losses or other non cash items recorded for the period  regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss  or in net income 
the amount will be adjusted to exclude one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other non cash charges after discussions between fidac and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
dividends to qualify as a reit  we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least of our taxable income 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under our warehouse and repurchase facilities  we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our warehouse lines and other debt payable 
capital expenditures at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities will be interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors will influence our performance far more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions will be determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our reit qualification  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are related to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment and market value risk 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk  which is the risk of loss due to a borrower s failure to repay principal or interest on a loan  a security or otherwise fail to meet a contractual obligation  in connection with our assets and will face more credit risk on assets we own which are rated below aaa 
the credit risk related to these assets pertains to the ability and willingness of the borrowers to pay  which is assessed before credit is granted or renewed and periodically reviewed throughout the loan or security term 
we believe that residual loan credit quality is primarily determined by the borrowers credit profiles and loan characteristics 
fidac uses a comprehensive credit review process 
fidac s analysis of loans includes borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data 
fidac s resources include a proprietary portfolio management system  as well as third party software systems 
fidac selects loans for review predicated on risk based criteria such as loan to value  a property s operating history and loan size 
fidac rejects loans that fail to conform to our standards 
fidac accepts only those loans which meet our underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  fidac s surveillance process includes ongoing analysis and oversight by our third party servicer and us 
additionally  cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs which we acquire for our portfolio will be reviewed by fidac to ensure that we acquire cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs which satisfy our risk based criteria 
fidac s review of cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs includes utilizing its proprietary portfolio management system 
fidac s review of cmbs  other commercial real estate related securities and rmbs is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk adjusted returns such securities present 
loans are assigned an internal rating of performing loans  watch list loans or workout loans 
performing loans meet all present contractual obligations 
watch list loans are defined as performing loans for which the timing of cost recovery is under review 
workout loans are defined as loans that are either not performing or the company does not expect to recover its cost basis 
the criteria used to asses these internal ratings are net operating income noi  debt service coverage dscr  property debt yields net cash flow or noi divided by the amount of outstanding indebtedness  loan per unit and rent rolls relating to each of its assets  and may consider other factors it deems important 
we review market pricing to determine the ability to refinance the asset 
we review economic trends  both macro as well as those directly affecting the property  and the supply and demand of competing projects in the sub market in which the subject property is located 
we also evaluate the borrower s ability to manage and operate the properties 
interest rate risk interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations  as well as other factors 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and any related financing obligations 
in general  we may finance the acquisition of our targeted assets through financings in the form of borrowings under programs established by the us government  warehouse facilities  bank credit facilities including term loans and revolving facilities  resecuritizations  securitizations and repurchase agreements 
we may mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our borrowings 
another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets we acquire 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we may acquire floating rate mortgage assets 
these are assets in which the mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the asset s interest yield may change during any given period 
our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements  however  will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our floating rate mortgage assets would effectively be limited 
in addition  floating rate mortgage assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash income on such assets than we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our analysis of interest rate risk is based on fidac s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of asset allocation decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in this form k 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results may depend  in part  on differences between the income from our investments and our borrowing costs 
most of our warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements would provide financing based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over libor 
the fixed spread varies depending on the type of underlying asset which collateralizes the financing 
accordingly  if a portion of our portfolio consisted of floating interest rate assets would be match funded utilizing our expected sources of short term financing  while our fixed interest rate assets will not be match funded 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with our investments could tend to increase while the income earned on our fixed interest rate investments may remain substantially unchanged 
this will result in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
further  during this portion of the interest rate and credit cycles  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
such delinquencies or defaults could also have an adverse effect on the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate debt investments 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the debt investments will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
interest rate effects on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the fair value of the assets we acquire 
we face the risk that the fair value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 
it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  in the event of changes in actual interest rates  the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders 
interest rate cap risk we may invest in adjustable rate mortgage loans and cmbs 
these are mortgages or cmbs in which the underlying mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the security s interest yield may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our adjustable rate mortgage loans and cmbs would effectively be limited 
this problem will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable rate cmbs that are not based on mortgages which are fully indexed 
in addition  the mortgages or the underlying mortgages in a cmbs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash income on our adjustable rate mortgages or cmbs than we need in order to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we may fund a portion of our acquisitions of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages  cmbs and rmbs with borrowings that  after the effect of hedging  have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgages  cmbs and rmbs 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
therefore  our cost of funds would likely rise or fall more quickly than would our earnings rate on assets 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
our analysis of risks is based on our manager s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in this form k 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income  portfolio value should interest rates go up or down   and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points prepayment risk as we receive prepayments of principal on our assets  premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets 
conversely  discounts on such investments are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on our assets 
for commercial real estate loans  the risk of prepayment is mitigated by call protection  which includes defeasance  yield maintenance premiums and prepayment charges 
extension risk fidac computes the projected weighted average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate asset is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  however  the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate assets would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate assets to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
market risk market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
as market volatility increases or liquidity decreases  the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted 
real estate risk commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit status  we will seek to manage risk exposure to protect our portfolio of commercial mortgage loans  cmbs  and commercial real estate related securities and related debt against the credit and interest rate risks 
we generally seek to manage our risk by analyzing the borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data  of the loans we acquire 
we expect that fidac s resources include a proprietary portfolio management system  as well as third party software systems  using fidac s proprietary portfolio management system to review our cmbs and other commercial real estate related securities  monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our targeted assets and our financings  attempting to structure our financings agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using derivatives  financial futures  swaps  options  caps  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our targeted assets and our borrowings  using securitization financing to lower average cost of funds relative to short term financing vehicles further allowing us to receive the benefit of attractive terms for an extended period of time in contrast to short term financing and maturity dates of the assets included in the securitization  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods  and gross reset margins of our targeted assets and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our financings 
our efforts to manage our assets and liabilities are concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if based on actual prepayment experience 
within year to greater than months months years years total rate sensitive assets  principal balance cash equivalents total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on our manager s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this form k 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
