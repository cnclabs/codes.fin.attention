regulation our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision 
general our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 
state insurance laws and regulations insurance laws regulate most aspects of our us insurance businesses  and our us insurers are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our non us insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled 
our insurance products  and thus our businesses  also are affected by us federal  state and local tax laws  and the tax laws of non us jurisdictions 
our securities operations  including our insurance products that are regulated as securities  such as variable annuities and variable life insurance  also are subject to us federal and state and non us securities laws and regulations 
the sec  the financial industry regulatory authority finra  state securities authorities and similar non us authorities regulate and supervise these products 
the primary purpose of the insurance laws affecting our insurance and securities businesses and their equivalents in the other countries in which we operate  and the securities laws affecting our variable annuity products  variable life insurance products  registered fabns  broker dealers and advisory businesses  is to protect our policyholders  contractholders and clients  not our stockholders 
these insurance laws are regularly re examined and any changes to these laws or new laws may be more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  insurance and securities regulatory authorities including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general or their non us equivalents periodically make inquiries regarding compliance with insurance  securities and other laws and regulations  and we cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted 
our distributors and institutional customers also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations may affect our business relationships with them and their decision to distribute or purchase our subsidiaries products 
in addition  the insurance laws of our us insurers domiciliary jurisdictions and the equivalent laws in the united kingdom  australia  canada and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate require that a person obtain the approval of the applicable insurance regulator prior to acquiring control  and in some cases prior to divesting its control  of an insurer 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent an investment in or a change of control involving us  or one or more of our regulated subsidiaries  including transactions that our management and some or all of our stockholders might consider desirable 

table of contents us insurance regulation our us insurers are licensed and regulated in all jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business 
the extent of this regulation varies  but insurance laws generally govern the financial condition of insurers  including standards of solvency  types and concentrations of permissible investments  establishment and maintenance of reserves  credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy  and the business conduct of insurers  including marketing and sales practices and claims handling 
in addition  insurance laws usually require the licensing of insurers and agents  and the approval of policy forms  related materials and the rates for certain lines of insurance 
the insurance laws applicable to us or our us insurers are described below 
our us mortgage insurers are also subject to additional insurance laws and regulations applicable specifically to mortgage insurers discussed below under mortgage insurance 
insurance holding company regulation all us jurisdictions in which our us insurers conduct business have enacted legislation requiring each us insurer except captive insurers in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary jurisdiction and furnish that regulatory authority various information concerning the operations of  and the interrelationships and transactions among  companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these insurance laws regulate transactions between insurers and their affiliates  sometimes mandating prior notice to the regulator and or regulatory approval 
generally  these insurance laws require that all transactions between an insurer and an affiliate be fair and reasonable  and that the insurer s statutory surplus following such transaction be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of our own  we depend on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations  including the payment of interest on  and repayment of principal of  any debt obligations 
our us insurers payment of dividends or other distributions is regulated by the insurance laws of their respective domiciliary states  and insurers may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution  or pay a dividend except out of earned surplus  without prior regulatory approval 
in general  an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined as a dividend or distribution that  together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater or  in some jurisdictions  the lesser of of the insurer s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end or the statutory net gain from the insurer s operations if a life insurer or the statutory net income if not a life insurer during the prior calendar year 
in addition  insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurers such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employment or other services if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders 
the insurance laws of our us insurers domiciliary jurisdictions require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of an insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction prior to acquiring control of such insurer 
control of an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the insurer or its ultimate parent entity 
in considering an application to acquire control of an insurer  the insurance commissioner generally considers factors such as the experience  competence and financial strength of the applicant  the integrity of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquirer s plans for the management and operation of the insurer  and any anti competitive results that may arise from the acquisition 
some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates and the target insurer and its affiliates have specified 
table of contents market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state 
these provisions may not require acquisition approval but can lead to imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic recently adopted significant changes to the insurance holding company act and regulations the naic amendments 
the naic amendments are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the united states 
one of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company system s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an enterprise risk report that identifies activities  circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that  if not remedied properly  are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole 
other changes include requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of a divestiture of control  detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and expansion of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator 
the naic amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective 
we cannot predict whether the naic amendments will be adopted in whole or in part by these states or the impact  if any  these changes will have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
periodic reporting our us insurers must file reports  including detailed annual financial statements  with insurance regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which they do business  and their operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities 
policy forms our us insurers policy forms are subject to regulation in every us jurisdiction in which they transact insurance business 
in most us jurisdictions  policy forms must be filed prior to their use  and in some us jurisdictions  forms must be approved by insurance regulatory authorities prior to use 
market conduct regulation the insurance laws of us jurisdictions govern the marketplace activities of insurers  affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers  product illustrations  advertising  product replacement  sales and underwriting practices  and complaint and claims handling  and these provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations 
statutory examinations insurance departments in us jurisdictions conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books  records  accounts and business practices of domestic insurers 
these examinations generally are conducted in cooperation with insurance departments of two or three other states or jurisdictions representing each of the naic zones  under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
guaranty associations and similar arrangements most jurisdictions in which our us insurers are licensed require those insurers to participate in guaranty associations which pay contractual benefits owed under the policies of impaired or insolvent insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
aggregate assessments levied against our us insurers were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents policy and contract reserve sufficiency analysis the insurance laws of their domiciliary jurisdictions require our us life insurers to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and health insurance and annuity reserves 
other jurisdictions where insurers are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions 
in each case  a qualified actuary must submit an opinion stating that the aggregate statutory reserves  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves  make good and sufficient provision for the insurer s associated contractual obligations and related expenses 
if such an opinion cannot be provided  the insurer must establish additional reserves by transferring funds from surplus 
our us life insurers submit these opinions annually to their insurance regulatory authorities 
different reserve requirements exist for our us mortgage insurance subsidiaries 
see reserves mortgage insurance 
surplus and capital requirements insurance regulators have the discretionary authority  in connection with maintaining the licensing of our us insurers  to limit or restrict insurers from issuing new policies  or policies having a dollar value over certain thresholds  if  in the regulators judgment  the insurer is not maintaining a sufficient amount of surplus or is in a hazardous financial condition 
we seek to maintain new business and capital management strategies to support meeting related regulatory requirements 
risk based capital the naic has established risk based capital rbc standards for us life insurers  as well as a risk based capital model act rbc model act 
all states and the district of columbia have adopted the rbc model act or a substantially similar law or regulation 
the rbc model act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their rbc based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate and market risk  and business risk 
the capital requirement for each is generally determined by applying factors which vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
if an insurer s rbc fell below specified levels  it would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level  ranging from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control 
as of december   the rbc of each of our us life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of rbc that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action 
statutory accounting principles us insurance regulators developed statutory accounting principles sap as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurers 
since insurance regulators are primarily concerned with ensuring an insurer s ability to pay its current and future obligations to policyholders  statutory accounting conservatively values the assets and liabilities of insurers  generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer s domiciliary jurisdiction 
uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the naic and are generally adopted by regulators in the various us jurisdictions 
due to differences in methodology between sap and us gaap  the values for assets  liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under sap 

table of contents regulation of investments each of our us insurers is subject to insurance laws that require diversification of its investment portfolio and which limit the proportion of investments in different asset categories 
assets invested contrary to such regulatory limitations must be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  regulations require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments made by our us insurers comply with these insurance laws 
federal regulation of insurance products most of our variable annuity products  some of our fixed guaranteed products  and all of our variable life insurance products  as well as our fabns issued as part of our registered notes program are securities within the meaning of federal and state securities laws  are registered under the securities act of and are subject to regulation by the sec 
see other laws and regulations securities regulation 
these products may also be indirectly regulated by finra as a result of finra s regulation of broker dealers and may be regulated by state securities authorities 
federal and state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under other laws and regulations securities regulation affects investment advice and sales and related activities with respect to these products 
in addition  although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including taxation  financial services regulation  and pension and welfare benefits regulation  can also significantly affect the insurance industry 
dodd frank act and other federal initiatives although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often  and increasingly  have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
from time to time  federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business  including limitations on antitrust immunity  tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts  simplification bills affecting tax advantaged or tax exempt savings and retirement vehicles  and proposals to modify or eliminate the estate tax 
in addition  various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed in recent years 
in response to the recent financial crisis  the dodd frank act was enacted and signed into law in july the dodd frank act made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations 
among other provisions  the dodd frank act provides for a new framework of regulation of over the counter otc derivatives markets which will require us to clear through clearing organizations certain types of transactions currently traded in the otc derivative markets and may limit our ability to customize certain derivative transactions for our needs 
in addition  we will likely experience additional collateral requirements and costs associated with derivative transactions 
the dodd frank act also authorizes the sec to adopt regulations that could impose heightened standards of care on sellers of variable or other registered products  which could adversely affect sales of and reduce margins on these products 
in the case of our us mortgage insurance business  the dodd frank act requires securitizers to retain some of the risk associated with mortgage loans they sell or securitize  unless the mortgage loans are qualified residential mortgages or unless the securitization or security is partially or fully exempted by regulations to be promulgated 
the dodd frank act provides that the definition of qualified residential mortgages will be determined by regulators  with consideration to be given  among other things  to the presence of mortgage insurance 
the legislation also prohibits a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination that  at the time the loan is consummated  the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan 
these provisions will be clarified in federal rules and regulations to be adopted 
in addition  the dodd frank act creates a bureau of consumer financial protection  which regulates certain aspects of the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services but not the business of insurance 
this bureau may issue rules or regulations that indirectly affect our us mortgage insurance business 
table of contents and may assert jurisdiction over regulatory or enforcement matters in lieu of or in addition to the existing jurisdiction of other federal or state agencies 
additionally  a residential mortgage backed securities working group was recently formed under president obama s financial fraud enforcement task force to investigate misconduct contributing to the financial crisis through the pooling and sale of residential mortgage backed securities 
this task force may seek to evaluate the broader us mortgage insurance industry  including our us mortgage insurance business  in the conduct of its work 
the dodd frank act also establishes a financial stability oversight council fsoc  which is authorized to subject non bank financial companies deemed systemically significant to stricter prudential standards and other requirements and to subject such companies to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code  administered by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
insurance company subsidiaries of systemically significant companies would remain subject to liquidation and rehabilitation proceedings under state law  although the fsoc is authorized to direct that such a proceeding be commenced against the insurer under state law 
systemically significant companies are also required to prepare resolution plans  so called living wills  that set out how they could most efficiently be liquidated if they endangered the us financial system or the broader economy 
insurance companies that are found to be systemically significant are permitted  in some circumstances  to submit abbreviated versions of such plans 
proposed rules regarding heightened prudential standards for systemically significant companies would impose new capital  liquidity  counterparty credit exposure and governance standards  and they would also subject such companies to restrictions on their activities and management if they appear to be at risk of liquidation 
there are no exceptions for insurance companies in these proposed regulations 
in addition  the dodd frank act establishes a federal insurance office within the department of the treasury 
while not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance  the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance  including serving as a non voting member of the fsoc and making recommendations to the fsoc regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation 
the director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states  including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states 
the dodd frank act imposes new restrictions on the sponsorship of and investment in private equity funds and hedge funds by companies that are affiliated with an insured depository institution 
while we are not affiliated with such an institution or with anyone who is  these restrictions may affect the value and salability of any interest we may have in such funds 
federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations that will implement the dodd frank act 
in addition  this legislation mandated multiple studies and reports for congress  which could in some cases result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
we cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted under the dodd frank act or any such additional legislation  the effect such legislation or regulations will have on financial markets generally  or on our businesses specifically  the additional costs associated with compliance with such regulations or legislation  or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply with the dodd frank act  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we also cannot predict whether other federal initiatives will be adopted or what impact  if any  such initiatives  if adopted as laws  may have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in tax laws changes in tax laws could make some of our products more or less attractive to consumers 
for example  the federal estate tax exclusion amount was recently increased to million  as adjusted for inflation  for  by the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of the legislation also permits a surviving spouse to succeed to any unused federal estate tax exclusion amount of the deceased spouse 
this permits the beneficiary of a survivorship life policy to receive a larger death benefit free of estate tax on the second spouse s death than would have been allowed under prior law  potentially making 
table of contents such policies more attractive to affluent customers 
however  since the estate tax exclusion had been million in  and our policyholders are generally not high net worth individuals who would be subject to the estate tax  we believe that these developments will have little effect on current sales of life insurance 
the scheduled reversion of individual income tax  dividend and capital gain rates to previous levels in tax years after was put on hold for two years  delaying to at least any incentive provided by rising tax rates for investors to buy our fixed deferred annuity products 
uk insurance regulation general insurance and reinsurance businesses in the united kingdom are subject to regulation by the financial services authority fsa  which has authorized certain of our uk subsidiaries to effect and carry out contracts of insurance in the united kingdom 
insurers authorized by the fsa in the united kingdom are generally able to operate throughout the european union  subject to satisfying certain fsa requirements and  in some cases  additional local regulatory provisions 
certain of our uk subsidiaries operate in other european union member states through establishment of branch offices 
supervision the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurers whereby it periodically performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups conducting business in the united kingdom 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile  including details of remedial action the fsa requires and the likely consequences of not taking such actions 
the fsa also supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  which subjects to fsa approval any person who performs certain specified controlled functions for or in relation to a regulated entity 
in addition  the fsa supervises the sale of general insurance  including certain lifestyle protection and mortgage insurance products 
under fsa rules  persons involved in the sale of general insurance including insurers and distributors are prohibited from offering or accepting any inducement in connection with the sale of general insurance that is likely to conflict materially with their duties to insureds 
although the rules do not generally require disclosure of broker compensation  the insurer or distributor must disclose broker compensation at the insured s request 
the uk government announced in that the fsa will be replaced by two new agencies  the prudential regulatory authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca 
the pra will be responsible for prudential regulation of banks and insurers  while the fca will be responsible for the conduct of business regulation and the wholesale and retail markets 
the legislation covering this change is anticipated to be passed during the course of our uk insurance subsidiaries will be subject to regulation by both the pra and the fca 
solvency requirements under fsa rules  insurers must maintain a minimum amount of capital resources for solvency purposes at all times  the calculation of which depends on the type  amount and claims history of the insurer 
failure to maintain the required minimum amount of capital resources is one of the grounds on which the fsa may exercise its wide powers of intervention 
in addition  an insurer that is part of a group is required to perform and submit to the fsa a capital resources calculation return in respect of the following the solvency capital resources available to the uk insurer s european group defined by reference to the uk insurer s ultimate parent company domiciled in the european economic area 
the solvency capital resources available to the uk insurer s worldwide group defined by reference to the uk insurer s ultimate parent company 
this requirement is only a reporting requirement 

table of contents there will be fundamental changes to the existing solvency capital regime for all insurers and reinsurers operating in europe as a result of the introduction of the solvency ii directive 
currently  these changes are expected to be effective by january  with a transition period starting on january  at this stage  it is not possible to predict the impact these changes will have on our operations 
restrictions on dividend payments the uk companies act prohibits uk companies from making a distribution such as a dividend to their stockholders unless they have profits available for distribution  the determination of which is based on the company s audited accumulated realized profits so far as not previously utilized by distribution less its accumulated realized losses so far as not previously written off 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an insurer or authorized person and has the power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of its rules 
such powers include the power to vary or withdraw any authorizations 
bermuda insurance regulation the bermuda monetary authority the bma regulates all financial institutions operating in or from bermuda  including our bermudian captive insurance companies 
specific regulation varies in bermuda depending on whether the insurance company has been granted a long term business license or a general business license and by the class under which each company falls within such licenses 
regardless of license or class  all companies are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus levels and minimum solvency standards and are subject to auditing and reporting requirements 
under bermuda s insurance act  in addition to the ability to pay dividends from retained earnings subject to certain procedures and compliance with applicable financial margins  bermuda insurance companies may distribute up to of their total paid in or contributed capital without the prior approval of the bma 
insurance companies may apply to the bma to make distributions in excess of such level 
in recent years  the bma has issued numerous detailed proposals to enhance its solvency  governance and disclosure requirements for insurance companies 
the bma has indicated that such requirements have been proposed in order for bermuda to achieve consistency with changes being developed by other leading insurance regulators worldwide  and in so doing achieve equivalence with solvency ii 
until the bma finalizes such proposals  we cannot be certain of their impact on our bermudian captive insurance companies or the impact  if any  on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
at the present time  however  we believe that each of our bermudian captive insurance companies will meet or exceed the new solvency requirements in bermuda 
mortgage insurance state regulation general mortgage insurers generally are limited by insurance laws to writing mortgage insurance business exclusively  prohibiting our mortgage insurers from directly writing other types of insurance 
mortgage insurers are not subject to the naic s rbc requirements but are subject to other capital requirements placed directly on mortgage insurers 
generally  mortgage insurers are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain a risk to capital ratio not to exceed north carolina law grants discretion to the commissioner of the north carolina department of insurance ncdoi  which is the domiciliary insurance regulator for our us mortgage insurers  through mid to allow a mortgage insurer to exceed the requirement if the 
table of contents commissioner finds that such insurer s contingency reserves and surplus are reasonable in relationship to its aggregate insured risk and adequate to its financial needs  taking into account a number of specified factors 
similar legislative or regulatory initiatives have been proposed or enacted in a number of other states that impose a similar risk to capital requirement on mortgage insurers 
as of december   genworth mortgage insurance corporation gemico  our primary us mortgage insurance subsidiary  exceeded the maximum risk to capital ratio of established under north carolina law and enforced by the ncdoi 
as of december  and  gemico s risk to capital ratio was approximately and  respectively 
however  effective january   the ncdoi granted gemico a revocable two year waiver of compliance with its risk to capital requirement 
the waiver  which the ncdoi can modify or terminate at any time in its discretion  gives gemico the ability to continue to write new business in north carolina during the period covered by the waiver  notwithstanding that gemico s risk to capital ratio exceeds thirty four of the states in which gemico operates do not impose their own risk to capital requirements  consequently  gemico is permitted to continue to write business in those states so long as it is permitted to write business in north carolina 
sixteen states including north carolina impose their own risk to capital requirements 
of these states  granted revocable waivers or the equivalent of their risk to capital requirements to allow gemico to continue to write new business  although two such waivers are no longer in effect as of december  consequently  gemico was authorized to write new business in states as of december  gemico is unable to write new business in the six states with risk to capital requirements where it was not able to obtain or no longer operates with the benefit of a waiver 
from december  until july  in the case of three of these states and for a longer period for the fourth state  we wrote new insurance through another of our us mortgage insurance subsidiaries  genworth residential mortgage insurance corporation of north carolina grmic nc 
with the approval of applicable state insurance regulators and the gses  after july   we began writing new business through genworth residential mortgage assurance corporation grmac in three of these states and after december   in the two additional states with alternative risk to capital waiver limitations while continuing to use grmic nc to write new business in the sixth state 
freddie mac s and fannie mae s approvals of this arrangement expire on july  and december   respectively 
reserves insurance laws require our us mortgage insurers to establish a special statutory contingency reserve in their statutory financial statements to provide for losses in the event of significant economic declines 
annual additions to the statutory contingency reserve must equal of net earned premiums as defined by insurance laws 
these contingency reserves generally are held until the earlier of i the time that loss ratios exceed or ii ten years  although regulators have granted discretionary releases from time to time 
this reserve reduces the policyholder surplus of our us mortgage insurers  and therefore  their ability to pay dividends to us 
since the loss ratio of our us mortgage insurers exceeded in  the regulator granted us approval to release a portion of the statutory contingency reserve in accordance with prescribed insurance laws 
as a result  the statutory contingency reserve for our us mortgage insurers was approximately million as of december  federal regulation in addition to federal laws that directly affect mortgage insurers  private mortgage insurers are affected indirectly by federal legislation and regulation affecting mortgage originators and lenders  by purchasers of mortgage loans such as freddie mac and fannie mae  and by governmental insurers such as the fha and va 
for example  changes in federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance may have a material effect on private mortgage insurers 
legislation or regulation that increases the number of people eligible for fha or va mortgages could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to compete with the fha or va 

table of contents the homeowners protection act provides for the automatic termination  or cancellation upon a borrower s request  of private mortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
the homeowners protection act applies to owner occupied residential mortgage loans regardless of lien priority and to borrower paid mortgage insurance closed after july  fha loans are not covered by the homeowners protection act 
under the homeowners protection act  automatic termination of mortgage insurance would generally occur once the loan to value ratio reaches 
a borrower generally may request cancellation of mortgage insurance once the actual payments reduce the loan balance to of the home s original value 
for borrower initiated cancellation of mortgage insurance  the borrower must have a good payment history as defined by the homeowners protection act 
the real estate settlement and procedures act of respa applies to most residential mortgages insured by private mortgage insurers 
mortgage insurance has been considered in some cases to be a settlement service for purposes of loans subject to respa 
subject to limited exceptions  respa precludes us from providing services to mortgage lenders free of charge  charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value  and paying fees for services that others provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value 
in addition  respa prohibits persons from giving or accepting any portion or percentage of a charge for a real estate settlement service  other than for services actually performed 
although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving rebates  respa has been interpreted to cover many non fee services as well 
mortgage insurers and their customers are subject to the possible sanctions of this law  which may be enforced by the us department of housing and urban development administration hud  state insurance departments  state attorneys general and other enforcement authorities 
the equal credit opportunity act ecoa and the fair credit reporting act fcra also affect the business of mortgage insurance in various ways 
ecoa  for example  prohibits discrimination against certain protected classes in credit transactions 
fcra governs the access and use of consumer credit information in credit transactions and requires notices to consumers in certain circumstances 
most originators of mortgage loans are required to collect and report data relating to a mortgage loan applicant s race  nationality  gender  marital status and census tract to hud or the federal reserve under the home mortgage disclosure act of hmda 
the purpose of hmda is to detect possible impermissible discrimination in home lending and  through disclosure  to discourage such discrimination 
mortgage insurers are not required to report hmda data although  under the laws of several states  mortgage insurers currently are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of certain classifications 
mortgage insurers have  through mortgage insurance companies of america  entered voluntarily into an agreement with the federal financial institutions examinations council to report the same data on loans submitted for insurance as is required for most mortgage lenders under hmda 
international regulation canada the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi provides oversight to all federally incorporated financial institutions  including our canadian mortgage insurance company  genworth financial mortgage insurance company canada  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of genworth canada 
osfi does not have enforcement powers over market conduct issues in the insurance industry  which are a provincial responsibility 
the bank act  insurance companies act and trust and loan companies act prohibit canadian banks  trust companies and insurers from extending mortgage loans where the loan value exceeds of the property s value  unless mortgage insurance is obtained in connection with the loan 
as a result  all mortgages issued by these financial institutions with a loan to value ratio exceeding must be insured by a qualified insurer or cmhc 
legislation became effective in canada in that  among other things  amended these statutes to prohibit such financial institutions from charging borrowers amounts for mortgage insurance that exceed the lender s actual costs and impose new disclosure obligations in respect of mortgage insurance 

table of contents the government guarantee agreement in place with the canadian government guarantees the benefits payable under mortgage insurance policies  less of the original principal amount of an insured loan  in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency 
we pay the canadian government a risk premium for this guarantee and make other payments to a reserve fund in respect of the government s obligation 
because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee  our sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 
in addition to recent amendments made to the government guarantee agreement  the canadian department of finance has informed us that they intend to continue to review the government guarantee agreement we have with the canadian government and we remain engaged in ongoing discussions with department of finance officials on this matter 
the insurance companies act of canada provides that dividends may only be declared by the board of directors of the canadian insurer and paid if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the payment of the dividend would not cause the insurer to be in violation of its minimum capital and liquidity requirements 
also  we are required to notify osfi at least days prior to the dividend payment date 
the legislative requirement in canada to obtain mortgage insurance on high loan to value mortgages and the favorable capital treatment given to financial institutions because of our sovereign guarantee effectively preclude these financial institutions from issuing simultaneous second mortgage products similar to those offered in the united states 
as a public company that is traded on the toronto stock exchange the tmx  genworth canada is subject to securities laws and regulation in each province in canada  as well as the reporting requirements of the tmx 
australia apra regulates all adis in australia and life  general and mortgage insurance companies 
apra s license conditions require australian mortgage insurers to be monoline insurers  which are insurers offering just one type of insurance product 
apra s regulations apply to individual licensed insurers and to the relevant australian based holding company and group 
apra also sets minimum capital levels and monitors corporate governance requirements  including our risk management strategy 
in this regard  apra reviews our management  controls  processes  reporting and methods by which all risks are managed  including an annual financial condition report and an annual report on insurance liabilities by an appointed actuary 
apra also requires us to submit our risk management strategy and reinsurance management strategy  which outlines our use of reinsurance in australia  annually and more frequently if there are material changes 
in setting minimum capital levels for mortgage insurers  apra requires them to ensure they have sufficient capital to withstand a hypothetical three year stress loss scenario defined by apra 
these regulations include increased mortgage insurers capital requirements for insured loans that are considered to be non standard 
apra also imposes quarterly reporting obligations on mortgage insurers with respect to risk profiles  reinsurance arrangements and financial position 
during  apra issued detailed proposals to revise the capital requirements for all insurers it regulates 
following receipt of feedback from the industry  including quantitative analyses from market participants  apra published updated proposals in march and december these proposals will  subject to feedback  be incorporated in revised prudential and reporting standards during with an effective date in january the current drafts of the new standards do not appear to indicate a material change to the regulatory capital requirements for our business 
as these standards have not yet been finalized  we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that these new regulations will have on our regulatory capital requirements 

table of contents in addition  apra determines the capital requirements for adis and has reduced capital requirements for certain adis that insure residential mortgages with an acceptable mortgage insurer for all non standard mortgages and for standard mortgages with loan to value ratios above 
apra s regulations currently set out a number of circumstances in which a loan may be considered to be non standard from an adi s perspective 
apra rules also provide that lmi on a non performing loan days plus arrears protects most adis from having to increase the regulatory capital on the loan to a risk weighting of

in december  the australian government announced a series of banking reforms designed to promote greater competition in the australian banking industry 
one key aspect of the proposals involved boosting consumer flexibility to transfer deposits and mortgages 
in particular  the australian government announced that it would consider instructing the australian treasury department to accelerate the development of potential frameworks to transfer lmi policies between lenders and introduce a central registry for mortgages 
currently  lmi policies are not transportable between lenders and are issued to a particular lender in respect of a particular loan 
in our australian mortgage insurance business  we offer rebate options to lenders whereby up to of the premium is refunded to the consumer if the loan is discharged in the first year  decreasing to in the second year of the mortgage  although many lenders elect to take a non refundable option in order to receive a lower overall premium structure 
the australian government has subsequently announced that it does not intend to make lmi portable but rather seek the introduction of a lmi key fact sheet which lenders will be required to give to borrowers

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements 
table of contents made by us or on our behalf 
these risks are not exclusive  and additional risks to which we are subject include  but are not limited to  the factors mentioned under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  risks relating to our businesses downturns and volatility in global economies and equity and credit markets could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our results of operations are materially affected by the state of the global economies in which we operate and conditions in the capital markets we access 
factors such as higher unemployment  lower consumer spending  lower business investment  higher government spending  the volatility and strength of the global capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
the recessionary state and the volatility of many economies have fueled uncertainty and downturns in global mortgage markets have contributed to increased volatility in our business and results of operations 
this uncertainty and volatility has impacted  and may continue to impact  the demand for certain financial and insurance products 
as a result  we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies  and some of our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 
if domestic and international equity and credit markets experience heightened volatility and turmoil  issuers that have exposure to the mortgage and credit markets would be particularly affected 
these events would have an adverse effect on us  in part because we have exposure to such issuers in our investment portfolio and also because such events can influence customer behavior 
in addition  given continuing economic challenges  issuers of the fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans that we own may default on principal and interest payments and we could experience significant declines in the value of our investment portfolio 
securities that are less liquid could also become more difficult to value and could be hard to dispose of in this economic environment 
the economic downturn has had  and continues to have  an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently access capital markets for capital management purposes  including the issuance of fixed and floating rate non recourse funding obligations for purposes of supporting our term and universal life insurance products 
if credit markets remain tight  this could have a continuing adverse impact on our profitability  liquidity and access to funding opportunities 
downturns and volatility in equity markets may also cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in our separate account products  which include variable annuities 
in addition  if the performance of the underlying mutual funds in the separate account products experience downturns and volatility for an extended period of time  the payment of any living benefit guarantee available in certain variable annuity products may have an adverse effect on us  because more payments will be required to come from general account assets than from contractholder separate account investments 
continued equity market volatility could result in additional losses in our variable annuity products and associated hedging program which will further challenge our ability to recover deferred acquisition costs dac on these products and could lead to additional write offs of dac  as well as increased hedging costs 
our revenues and returns from our mutual fund wrapped and separately managed account products and services could also be impacted by downturns and volatility in equity markets 
because these products and services generate fees generally from the value of assets under management  a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage 
downturns in equity markets could also lead to an increase in liabilities associated with secondary guarantee features  such as guaranteed minimum benefits on separate account products  where we have equity market risk exposure 

table of contents a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
financial strength ratings  which various rating agencies publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our products  the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
credit ratings  which rating agencies publish as measures of an entity s ability to repay its indebtedness  are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and other forms of credit and to the cost of such financing 
a ratings downgrade could occur for a variety of reasons  including reasons specifically related to our company  generally related to our industry or the broader financial services industry or as a result of changes by the rating agencies in their methodologies or rating criteria 
a negative outlook on our ratings or a downgrade in any of our financial strength or credit ratings  the announcement of a potential downgrade  or customer concerns about the possibility of a downgrade  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these direct or indirect effects could include reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  requiring us to modify some of our existing products or services to remain competitive  or introduce new products or services  adversely affecting our relationships with key distributors  independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  including the loss of exclusivity under certain agreements with our independent sales intermediaries  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders  requiring us to post additional collateral or terminate contracts under the terms of agreements with derivative counterparties  or to provide support in the form of collateral  capital contributions or letters of credit under the terms of certain of our reinsurance  securitization and other agreements  adversely affecting our ability to maintain reinsurance assumed or obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing terms  adversely affecting our ability to raise capital  and increasing our cost of borrowing 
in addition  fannie mae and freddie mac require maintenance of a financial strength rating by at least two out of three listed rating agencies s p  fitch and moody s of at least aa aa as applicable  otherwise additional limitations or requirements may be in the case of fannie mae or will be in the case of freddie mac imposed for eligibility to insure loans purchased by the gses 
in february  fannie mae and freddie mac temporarily suspended their ratings requirements for top tier mortgage insurers  subject to submission of an acceptable remediation plan 
we have submitted remediation plans to both gses and to date have not been advised that either intends to impose additional requirements upon us 
as of december   fannie mae and freddie mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured in the united states 
an inability to insure mortgage loans sold to fannie mae or freddie mac  or their transfer of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer  would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations and levels could adversely affect our business and profitability 
our insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that falling interest rates or credit spreads will reduce our margin or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we must pay to policyholders and contractholders 
because we may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited  pre established intervals  and because some contracts have guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates  declines in interest rates have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the profitability of these products 

table of contents during periods of increasing market interest rates  we may offer higher crediting rates on interest sensitive products  such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities  and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive 
in addition  rapidly rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders  withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans  as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments 
increases in crediting rates  as well as surrenders and withdrawals  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  including the requirement to liquidate fixed income investments in an unrealized loss position to satisfy surrenders or withdrawals 
our life and long term care insurance products  as well as our guaranteed benefits on variable annuities  also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns 
over time  life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums  which we invest as they are received 
low interest rates increase reinvestment risk and reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our life and long term care insurance products and may increase hedging costs on our in force block of variable annuity products 
a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively impact the sufficiency of our margins on our dac and present value of future profits pvfp  which could result in an impairment of these assets 
in addition  certain statutory capital requirements are based on models that consider interest rates 
prolonged periods of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves 
in both the us and international mortgage markets  rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations 
a decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our new mortgage insurance written 
rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages arms that could have the effect of increasing default rates on arm loans and thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies 
this is particularly relevant in our international mortgage insurance business where arms are the predominant mortgage product 
declining interest rates historically have increased the rate at which borrowers refinance their existing mortgages  thereby resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans 
declining interest rates historically also have contributed to home price appreciation  which may provide borrowers in the united states with the option of cancelling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated when pricing that coverage 
these cancellations could have an adverse effect on our results from our us mortgage insurance business 
however  under current housing market conditions  we are in a period of home price depreciation in a majority of us markets 
consequently  some borrowers in the united states do not have sufficient equity to allow refinancing of existing higher rate arms for lower rate mortgage loans  an action that would typically result in the cancellation of existing mortgage insurance coverage 
such borrowers are now contributing to higher delinquencies and foreclosures where they are not able to meet the reset higher monthly payments due under the terms of the underlying arms 
these developments have had an adverse impact on our us mortgage insurance business 
interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio 
during periods of declining market interest rates  the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases 
in addition  during those periods  we may have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding high grade instruments or in lower credit instruments to maintain comparable returns 
issuers of fixed income securities may also decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbates the risk that we may have to invest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower yielding or lower credit instruments 
during periods of increasing interest rates  market values of lower yielding assets will decline 
in addition  our interest rate hedges will decline which will require us to post additional collateral with our derivative counterparties 

table of contents adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and may affect our ability to meet liquidity or refinancing requirements in the future 
in addition  we are seeking to extend  replace or refinance  in part  our credit facilities that expire in may and august  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend  replace or refinance these facilities on terms or at targeted amounts acceptable to us or at all 
in the event market or other conditions have an adverse impact on our capital and liquidity needs beyond expectations and our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs  we could have to seek additional funding 
we may also need to seek additional funding to refinance existing indebtedness or to build buffers and manage overall capital and risk profiles at the holding company 
funding sources could potentially include the generation of proceeds from the sale of assets including assets in our investment portfolio  blocks of business or all or a portion of a business or the incurrence of additional debt 
in addition  funding sources could potentially include issuing equity  with any decision to issue equity considering the degree to which such an equity issuance would dilute current stockholders value 
all such funding sources could have adverse impacts on our financial condition  including book value  and results of operations 
the availability of additional funding will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  regulatory considerations  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  the level of activity and availability of reinsurers or acquirers of assets  our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our business 
market conditions may make it difficult to obtain funding or complete asset sales to generate additional liquidity  especially on short notice 
our access to funding may be further impaired if our credit or financial strength ratings are negatively impacted 
specifically with respect to our credit facilities that expire in may and august  we are currently exploring the potential replacement  in part  of these facilities for a lower principal amount of permitted borrowings and letters of credit or by pursuing alternative strategies 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and had utilized million under these facilities primarily for the issuance of letters of credit for the benefit of one of our life insurance subsidiaries 
due to potentially adverse credit market conditions generally or potentially adverse outlooks with respect to our industry or the company in particular  there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend  replace or refinance these facilities on terms or at targeted amounts acceptable to us or at all 
our valuation of fixed maturity  equity and trading securities may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturity  equity and trading securities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
they represent the majority of our total cash  cash equivalents and invested assets 
our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of investment grade securities 
valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation  as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated or require greater estimation  thereby resulting in values that are less certain and may vary significantly from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold 
the methodologies  estimates and assumptions we use in valuing our investment securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretation including based on developments in relevant accounting literature  all of which can lead to changes in the value of our investment securities 
rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investment securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
defaults  downgrades or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income 
we are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal or interest payments they owe us 
as of december   fixed maturity securities of billion in 
table of contents our investment portfolio represented of our total cash  cash equivalents and invested assets 
events reducing the value of our investment portfolio other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
levels of write downs or impairments are impacted by our assessment of the financial condition of the issuer  whether or not the issuer is expected to pay its principal and interest obligations or circumstances that would require us to sell securities which have declined in value 
our investment portfolio contains investments in securities in multiple nations  including companies domiciled in the european union 
recently  the european union member states have experienced increases in their debt levels as a percentage of gross domestic product as well as increased inflation and unemployment as the global economic downturn has developed 
financial troubles of certain nations can trigger financial implications in other nations 
in particular  a number of large european banks hold significant amounts of sovereign financial institution debt of other european nations and could experience difficulties as a result of defaults or declines in the value of such debt 
if we determine to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio where we determine to sell certain securities in an unrealized loss position  we will incur an other than temporary impairment charge 
defaults on our commercial mortgage loans or the mortgage loans underlying our investments in commercial mortgage backed securities and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability 
our commercial mortgage loans and investments in commercial mortgage backed securities face default risk 
commercial mortgage loans are stated on our consolidated balance sheets at unpaid principal balance  adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount  deferred fees or expenses  and are net of impairments and valuation allowances 
we establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments as of the balance sheet date based on information  such as the market value of the underlying real estate securing the loan  any third party guarantees on the loan balance or any cross collateral agreements and their impact on expected recovery rates 
commercial mortgage backed securities are stated on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
in addition  some of our commercial mortgage loans and the underlying mortgage loans supporting our investments in commercial mortgage backed securities have balloon payment maturities 
further  any concentration of geographic or sector exposure in our commercial mortgage loans or the mortgage loans underlying our investments in commercial mortgage backed securities may have adverse effects on our investment portfolio and consequently on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are exposed 
we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of our goodwill  which would increase our expenses and reduce our us gaap profitability 
goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire our subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition 
under us gaap  we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  which is either an operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment 
goodwill is impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is less than the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  plus the carrying value of goodwill  at the date of the test 
for example  goodwill may become impaired if the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole were to decline by an amount greater than the decline in the value of its individually identifiable assets and liabilities 
this may occur for various reasons  including changes in actual or expected income or cash flows of a reporting unit or generation of income by a reporting unit at a lower rate of return than similar businesses or for decreases in our market capitalization 
if any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired  we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a non cash expense in the current period
