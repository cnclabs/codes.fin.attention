table of contents item legal proceedings 
in august  forest sold all of its alaska assets to pacific energy resources ltd 
and its related entities perl 
on march   perl filed for bankruptcy 
as part of the plan of liquidation of its bankruptcy  perl abandoned its interests in many of the alaska assets sold to it by forest  including the trading bay unit and trading bay field trading bay 
at the time of the abandonment of perl s interests in trading bay  union oil company of california unocal was the operator of those assets 
on december   unocal filed a lawsuit styled union oil company of california v 
forest oil corporation in anchorage district court  alaska 
forest has removed the case to federal district court in anchorage  alaska 
in the lawsuit  the plaintiff complains about perl s abandonment of trading bay and states that perl has failed to pay approximately million in joint interest billings owed on those properties to date from the time perl owned them 
the plaintiff further claims that forest is liable for perl s share of all joint interest billings owed on trading bay  in arrears and in the future  because forest was the predecessor party to the contracts governing the operations at trading bay  unocal did not agree that  in conjunction with forest s sale of its alaska assets  forest would be released of its obligations under the trading bay contracts  and perl has defaulted on the joint interest billings owed on trading bay since october as of december   unocal sold its interest in the trading bay assets  including its claims against forest  to hilcorp energy company 
although we are unable to predict the final outcome of this case  we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend the action 
we are a party to various other lawsuits  claims  and proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
these proceedings are subject to uncertainties inherent in any litigation  and the outcome of these matters is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
we believe that the amount of any potential loss associated with these proceedings would not be material to our consolidated financial position  however  in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential loss could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow

historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k with the sec  and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since our total estimated proved reserves as of december   were approximately  bcfe 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were in the united states 
having spun off our canadian operations on september   we currently conduct our operations in one reportable geographical segment the united states 
our core operational areas are in the texas panhandle  the east texas north louisiana area  and the eagle ford shale in south texas 
see item business for a discussion of our business strategy and core operational areas of focus 
in december  we announced our intention to separate our canadian operations through an initial public offering of up to of the common stock of our then wholly owned subsidiary  lone pine resources inc lone pine  which would hold our ownership interests in our canadian operations  followed by a distribution  or spin off  of the remaining shares of lone pine held by us to our shareholders 
the offering occurred in june  whereby we retained approximately of the outstanding shares of lone pine s common stock 
lone pine used the net proceeds from the offering  along with borrowings under its credit facility  to pay us approximately million  as partial consideration for our contribution to lone pine of our interests in the canadian operations  and to repay an intercompany note and intercompany advances and accrued interest of approximately million 
the spin off of our remaining shares of lone pine to our shareholders was completed on september  as a result of the spin off  lone pine s results of operations are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
highlights forest s highlights are as follows completed an initial public offering and the subsequent spin off of lone pine to forest shareholders 
each forest shareholder of record on september  received approximately 
shares of lone pine stock for every share of forest stock held 
drilled or participated in gross net wells in the united states in including gross net horizontal wells in the texas panhandle with gross wells targeting two new oil zones and three additional liquids rich gas intervals  bringing the total number of productive intervals to in the texas panhandle 
continued the initial development of our acreage in the eagle ford shale oil window with the drilling of wells focusing on optimizing the development of the resource 
this optimization included taking core samples  acquiring d seismic  the utilization of micro seismic during horizontal well completion  and testing different sections of the eagle ford shale 
initiated the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in the permian basin in west texas 
as of february  we have acquired over  gross acres  net in the area at an average cost of approximately  per acre 
the acreage position includes  net acres prospective for the wolfcamp shale in crockett county  texas and  net acres prospective for the wolfbone intervals in pecos and reeves counties  texas 
recent trends and outlook beginning in the second half of and continuing throughout  the united states and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown 
during the same time period  north american natural gas supply increased as a result of increased domestic unconventional natural gas development and associated natural gas from oil development 
in the second half of  oil and natural gas prices declined dramatically 
while oil and ngl prices have steadily improved since the first quarter of  north american natural gas prices have remained at low levels and declined further in late as a result of increased supply and weak domestic demand in the united states 
we do not plan on natural 
table of contents gas prices improving significantly in as a result  as we did in  we plan to direct the majority of our exploration and development capital expenditures in to more liquids rich prospects

see reconciliation of non gaap measure at the end of this item for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to reported net earnings loss from continuing operations  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
our net earnings loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations presented in the table above were primarily impacted by changes in oil  natural gas  and ngl production volumes and prices  changes in realized and unrealized derivative gains and  in  a non cash ceiling test write down of billion 
see below for further discussion of these items 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  which excludes the effects of ceiling test write downs and other non cash items  was also primarily impacted by changes in oil  natural gas  and ngl production volumes and prices for the periods presented  as well as changes in realized derivative gains

oil and natural gas volumes and revenues oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids ngl sales volumes  revenues  and average sales prices from continuing operations for the years ended december    and  are set forth in the table below

table of contents primarily due to a decrease in natural gas production  which resulted from our decision to reduce capital expenditures for dry gas wells in response to declining natural gas prices 
in  we redirected capital expenditures from dry gas well development towards liquids and oil rich prospects  including the early stage development of our eagle ford oil play and the acquisition of new leaseholds in the permian basin prospective for oil development 
oil and natural gas revenues were essentially flat between and  primarily due to an increase in oil and ngl prices that was offset by a decrease in natural gas production and prices 
our reported oil  natural gas  and ngl sales volumes from continuing operations decreased in compared to the decrease was due to oil and gas property divestitures that occurred primarily in late partially offset by production increases attributable to new wells drilled in oil and natural gas revenues in were million  an increase as compared to million in oil and natural gas revenues increased due to the increase in the average realized sales price per mcfe  partially offset by the decrease in sales volumes discussed above 
the revenues and average sales prices reflected in the table above exclude the effects of commodity derivative instruments since we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges

year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data stock based compensation costs other general and administrative costs general and administrative costs capitalized general and administrative expense general and administrative expense per mcfe general and administrative expense was million in each of the years presented 
stock based compensation costs and general and administrative costs capitalized under the full cost method of accounting increased in due to the recognition of million million of expense  net of capitalized amounts of costs in the third quarter of due to the spin off of lone pine  which caused the forfeiture restrictions to lapse on a portion of each outstanding restricted stock award  thus requiring the immediate recognition of compensation cost 
this increase in stock based compensation costs was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs due to a decline in our stock price in the percentage of general and administrative costs capitalized remained consistent between the three years presented  ranging between and

year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense per mcfe depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense dd a increased

ceiling test write down of oil and gas properties pursuant to the ceiling test limitation prescribed by the sec for companies using the full cost method of accounting  forest recorded a non cash ceiling test write down for its united states cost center totaling billion in the first quarter the write down was a result of significant declines in oil and natural gas prices in the first quarter of see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions full cost method of accounting 

table of contents interest expense the following table summarizes interest expense from continuing operations for the periods indicated

in addition  in december  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
interest costs capitalized relate to our investments in significant unproved acreage positions that are under development 
in order to effectively reduce the concentration of fixed rate debt anticipated after the completion of our oil and gas property divestiture program and the related reduction in our credit facility balance  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps in the first quarter of under which we have swapped  as of december   million in notional amount at an fixed rate for an equal notional amount at a weighted average interest rate equal to the month libor plus approximately 
we recognized realized gains under these interest rate swaps of million during each of the years ended december  and and million during the year ended december  these gains are recorded as realized gains on derivatives rather than as a reduction to interest expense since we have not elected to use hedge accounting

perl  which included claims in excess of million 
perl and the other plaintiffs released us from all claims and agreed to dismiss the complaint against us in exchange for a million payment from us 
gain on debt extinguishment the net gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended december  includes the net gain related to the january redemption of our million senior notes due at of par 
a net gain was recognized due to the write off  at the time the notes were redeemed  of unamortized deferred gains resulting from the previous termination of interest rate swaps related to these notes 
this gain was partially offset by the million redemption premium paid to redeem the notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt 
income tax the table below sets forth the total income tax and effective income tax rates related to continuing operations for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentages current income tax deferred income tax total income tax effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate generally approximates to 
our effective income tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  due to the canadian dividend tax of million that was incurred on a stock dividend declared and paid by our former canadian subsidiary  lone pine resources canada ltd 
lpr canada  to forest  as parent  immediately before forest s contribution of lpr canada to lone pine in conjunction with lone pine s initial public offering 
without the million dividend tax  our effective income tax rate would have been in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of income tax computed by applying the united states federal statutory income tax rates for each period presented 
discontinued operations the results of operations of lone pine are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of 
table of contents operations due to the spin off of lone pine on september   with prior periods results recast to conform with the discontinued operations presentation 
earnings from discontinued operations was negatively impacted by a ceiling test write down in the canadian cost center of million during see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the components of discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash flow from operations and our bank credit facility as our primary sources of liquidity 
to fund large transactions  such as acquisitions and debt refinancing transactions  we have looked to the private and public capital markets as another source of financing and  as market conditions have permitted  we have engaged in asset monetization transactions 
changes in the market prices for oil  natural gas  and ngls directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
natural gas accounted for approximately of our total production in and  as a result  our operations and cash flow are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for natural gas than to fluctuations in the market price for oil and ngls 
we employ a commodity hedging strategy as an attempt to moderate the effects of wide fluctuations in commodity prices on our cash flow 
as of february   we had hedged  via commodity swaps  approximately bcfe of our total projected production and approximately bcf of our total projected production  excluding outstanding commodity swaptions and put options 
this level of hedging will provide a measure of certainty of the cash flow that we will receive for a portion of our production in however  these hedging activities may result in reduced income or even financial losses to us 
see part i  item a  risk factors our use of hedging transactions could reduce our cash flow and or result in reported losses  for further details of the risks associated with our hedging activities 
in the future  we may determine to increase or decrease our hedging positions 
as of february   all of our derivative instrument counterparties are lenders  or affiliates of lenders  under our credit facility  with the exception of one counterparty 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk  below for more information on our derivative contracts including commodity swaptions and put options 
the other primary source of liquidity is our credit facility  which had a borrowing base of billion as of december  this facility is used to fund daily operations and to fund acquisitions and refinance debt  as needed and if available 
the credit facility is secured by a portion of our assets  with the facility maturing in june see bank credit facility below for further details 
we had million and million drawn on our credit facility as of december  and january   respectively 
the public and private capital markets have served as our primary source of financing to fund large acquisitions and other exceptional transactions 
in the past  we have issued debt and equity in both the public and private capital markets 
for example  in february  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in a private offering for net proceeds of million  and in may  we issued approximately million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economic terms is affected by general economic conditions  the domestic and global financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of our equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
we also have engaged in asset dispositions as a means of generating additional cash to fund expenditures and enhance our financial flexibility 
for example  during   and  we sold certain assets for approximately million  million  and million  respectively  with a portion of these proceeds used to pay off the outstanding balance under our credit facility in and redeem our senior notes due in january we believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities and the funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our normal recurring operating needs  anticipated capital expenditures  and our contractual obligations 
however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of a deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions  a significant decline in commodity prices  or a continuation of depressed natural gas prices  we may elect to reduce our planned capital expenditures 
we believe that this financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and financial and operating results 
bank credit facility on june   we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  consisting of a billion credit facility maturing in june 
table of contents subject to the agreement of us and the applicable lenders  the size of the credit facility may be increased by million  to a total of billion 
our availability under the credit facility is governed by a borrowing base 
as of december   the borrowing base under the credit facility was billion 
the determination of the borrowing base is made by the lenders in their sole discretion  on a semi annual basis  taking into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time  in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the available borrowing amount under the credit facility could increase or decrease based on such redetermination 
in addition to the scheduled semi annual redeterminations  we and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during a calendar year  to have the borrowing base redetermined 
the borrowing base is also subject to automatic adjustments if certain events occur 
the borrowing base was reaffirmed at billion in october and the next scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base will occur on or about may  the borrowing base is also subject to change in the event i we or our restricted subsidiaries issue senior unsecured notes  in which case the borrowing base will immediately be reduced by an amount equal to of the stated principal amount of such issued senior notes  excluding any senior unsecured notes that we or any of our restricted subsidiaries may issue to refinance then existing senior notes  or ii we sell oil and natural gas properties included in the borrowing base having a fair market value in excess of of the borrowing base then in effect 
if the borrowing base is reduced to a level that is below our level of borrowing under the credit facility  we would be required to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base in order to cover the deficiency

credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies 
moody s investor services and standard poor s rating services currently rate each series of our senior notes and  in addition  they have assigned forest a general credit rating 
our credit facility includes provisions that are linked to our credit ratings 
for example  our collateral requirements will vary based on our credit ratings  however  we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under the credit facility or the debt issued under the indentures for our senior notes 
the indentures for our senior notes also include terms linked to our credit ratings 
these terms allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied  in which event we would not be obligated to comply with certain restrictive covenants included in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit rating at the time any such financing activities are conducted

table of contents we have established an exploration and development capital budget of million to million for and plan to focus heavily on oil and other liquids based drilling opportunities within our concentrated asset base 
primary factors impacting the level of our capital expenditures include crude oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of oil field services  general economic and market conditions  and weather disruptions

derivative liabilities represent the fair value of our derivative liabilities as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
other liabilities are comprised of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
operating leases consist of leases for drilling rigs  compressors  and office facilities and equipment 
unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of drilling commitments  throughput obligations  and seismic purchase obligations 
we also make delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our maximum commitment of future delay lease rental payments  through  totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and other transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and other transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv other contractual obligations for which we have recorded estimated liabilities on the balance sheet  but the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable  such as derivative contracts  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  and asset retirement obligations 
we do not believe that any of these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies

see part i  item business industry regulation for further information 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for in the current quarter and prospectively in the depletion calculations 
we have historically updated our quarterly depletion calculations with our quarter end reserves estimates 
based on this accounting policy  our december  reserves estimates were used for our fourth quarter depletion calculation 
see part i  item  business reserves and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our estimated proved reserves as of december  companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter for each cost center 
the full cost ceiling test is a limitation on capitalized costs prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is not a fair value based measurement 
rather  it is a standardized mathematical calculation 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
forest recorded a billion non cash ceiling test write down in the first quarter of as a result of significant declines in oil and natural gas prices at that time 
we have not incurred a ceiling test write down since march  through december  our ceiling test calculations are based on the twelve month average natural gas and oil prices since december  in accordance with sec regulations 
in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess properties whose costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis 
impairments are also assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the second quarter of the year 
in addition  we test goodwill for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests  indicating a possible impairment 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit  which we have 
table of contents determined to be our us geographic operating segment  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price was being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of operations 
to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  we use a discounted cash flow model to value our total estimated reserves  which include proved  probable  and possible reserves 
this approach relies on significant judgments about the quantity of reserves  the timing of the expected production  the pricing that will be in effect at the time of production  and the appropriate discount rates to be used 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of forest s weighted average cost of capital 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of and no events or circumstances have occurred since then that have indicated a possible impairment  requiring an updated test 
due to the significant judgments that go into the test  as discussed above  there can be no assurance that our goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
oil and gas reserves estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and governmental regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent uncertainty in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to reserves under part i  item business  and our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty  which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition  under part i  item a risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
fair value of derivative instruments we use the income approach in determining the fair value of our derivative instruments  utilizing present value techniques for valuing our swaps and option pricing models for valuing our collars  swaptions  puts  and calls 
inputs to these valuation techniques include published forward prices  volatilities  and credit risk considerations  including the incorporation of published interest rates and credit spreads 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in fair value of the derivative offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
we have elected not to use hedge accounting to account for our derivative instruments and  as a result  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and interest rates  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market 
table of contents risk for a sensitivity analysis of the change in net fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivatives based on a hypothetical change in commodity prices and interest rates 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in earnings in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether future book income is sufficient to reverse existing temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets  as well as whether future taxable income is sufficient to utilize net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
assessing the need for  or the sufficiency of  a valuation allowance requires the evaluation of all available evidence  both negative and positive 
negative evidence considered by management primarily included book losses incurred in and that were driven entirely from ceiling test write downs  which are not fair value based measurements 
under the full cost method of accounting  we recorded billion in ceiling test write downs of the book value of our us oil and gas properties in and  which substantially reduced the book value of our oil and gas properties  resulting in the recognition of a net deferred tax asset 
however  the write downs also substantially reduced our prospective depletion rate at the time the write downs occurred  making future book income  and therefore the reversal of book to tax temporary differences  more likely than would be the case had these ceiling test write downs not occurred 
positive evidence considered by management included book income in and  forecasted book income over a reasonable period of time  and the utilization of substantially all of our then existing net operating loss nol carryforwards in due primarily to a substantial tax gain associated with the sale of nearly billion in us oil and gas assets 
based upon the evaluation of what management determined to be relevant evidence  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary evidence utilized to determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized was management s expectation of future book income over the next several years  the expectation that we will utilize our net operating losses as of december  by carrying them back to  and the fact that amt credit carryforwards do not expire 
asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs periodically change  as do regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  which is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations

 comprehensive income  presentation of comprehensive income asu  which provides amendments that will result in more converged guidance on how comprehensive income is presented under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu requires an entity to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income  and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements and eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
asu also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income

asu  which indefinitely defers the requirements in asu to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income 
both asu and asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this authoritative guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  but will require us to present the statements of comprehensive income separately from our statements of shareholders equity  as these statements are currently presented on a combined basis

 fair value measurement  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu  which amends the current us gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance  to converge us gaap and ifrs requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures about these measurements 
many of the amendments clarify existing concepts and are not expected to result in significant changes to how companies apply the fair value principles 
this authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this authoritative guidance will have on our fair value measurements and disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing goodwill for impairment asu  which permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test  which may then lead an entity to performing the second step as well 
entities have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the two step impairment test 
this authoritative guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance may change the methodology that we use to test our goodwill for impairment depending on the events or circumstances at the time the test is performed 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu  which requires that an entity disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions that are either eligible for offset in the balance sheet or subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement  including derivative instruments 
asu was issued in order to facilitate comparison between us gaap and ifrs financial statements by requiring enhanced disclosures  but does not change existing us gaap that permits balance sheet offsetting 
this authoritative guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this authoritative guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  but will require us to make enhanced disclosures regarding our derivative instruments 
reconciliation of non gaap measure adjusted ebitda in addition to reporting net earnings from continuing operations as defined under gaap  we also present adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap performance measure 
adjusted ebitda consists of net earnings from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  as well as other non cash operating items such as unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and accretion of asset retirement obligations and other items presented in the table below 
adjusted ebitda does not represent  and should not be considered an alternative to  gaap measurements  such as net earnings from continuing operations its most comparable gaap financial measure  and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
by eliminating interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  and other items from earnings  we believe the result is a useful measure across time in evaluating our fundamental core operating performance 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to manage its business  including in preparing its annual operating budget and financial projections 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries 
our management does not view adjusted ebitda in isolation and also uses other measurements  such as net earnings from continuing operations and revenues to measure operating performance 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings from continuing operations  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and ngls in the united states 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of a commodity hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other derivative instruments with counterparties who  in general  are lenders  or affiliates of such lenders  in our credit facility 
these arrangements  which are typically based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis

for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil  natural gas  and ngl prices used to calculate the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments at december  would decrease the net fair value of our commodity derivative instruments at december  by approximately million to a net asset of million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue
