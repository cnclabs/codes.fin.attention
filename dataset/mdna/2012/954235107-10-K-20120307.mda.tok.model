overview we are the largest specialty retailer of boating supplies and accessories with net revenues of million and net income of million 
our business strategy is to offer a broad assortment of merchandise for the boat and for the boater that meets the needs of individual boaters and boating businesses  provides great customer experiences and offers the convenience of multi channel shopping 
a few of the new or continuing key strategies we are implementing or building upon during include expanding our merchandise selection  including adding product assortment throughout our wide range of merchandise categories and accelerating development of west marine private label brands across a number of categories 
continuing to focus on our real estate optimization program pursuant to which we are evolving toward having fewer but larger stores 
growing our port supply wholesale business by continuing to leverage our store network as a complement to delivering goods out of our distribution centers  with an emphasis on treating our larger stores in certain markets as hubs or regional distribution centers that offer assortment and convenience with personal service and more delivery options 
driving sales growth by improving the on line experience for our retail and wholesale customers with expanded assortments  more and better content  improved search capabilities  faster speed and other new features 
we believe the websites drive traffic and sales in all segments 
placing emphasis on driving comparable store sales by increasing associate knowledge through technical training  promoting the option of buying on line and picking up in a store  and encouraging customers to join and benefit from our west advantage loyalty membership programs 
we have three reportable segments stores  port supply  and direct to customer 
our stores segment generated approximately of our net revenues 
our company operated stores open at the end of are located in states  puerto rico and canada 
in addition  we have three franchised stores in turkey 
our port supply segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors of marine equipment in the united states 
products shipped to port supply customers directly from our distribution centers represented approximately of our net revenues 
our direct to customer segment  which includes our retail ecommerce  direct mail catalogs and call center operations  offers customers around the world approximately  products  and it accounted for the remaining of our net revenues 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense store closures and other restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets income from operations interest expense income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to net revenues of million for sales increased in the electronics and fishing categories  which are primarily discretionary items  as well as in the apparel categories  which we attribute to our merchandise expansion strategy 
during the first half of the year  sales of usage based items  such as maintenance  engine parts and electrical products  were lower than the prior due to inclement weather in many markets  however  as we progressed through the remainder of the fiscal year  we saw increased sales and ended the year with higher sales in these categories 
we expect consumers to continue to carefully evaluate their needs based boating purchases and their spending on discretionary items 
we believe that economic uncertainty  including fuel prices  could continue to have an impact on our sales  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in in response  we will continue to focus on managing expenses  while making prudent investments in growth and emphasizing working capital management 
net income for was million compared to net income for of million 
the increase in net income was attributable to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance discussed below under income taxes and net revenues growth outpacing the costs of goods sold 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to an million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
a driver of the comparable store sales increase was higher sales to wholesale customers through our store locations  which we believe resulted from our ongoing efforts to better serve this group of customers through store locations 
in certain markets  our larger stores serve as hubs or regional distribution centers that offer better assortments and convenience with personal service and more delivery options for wholesale customers 
real estate activity connected with our store optimization strategy drove an million increase in net revenues as stores opened during the fourth quarter of  and stores opened during generated million in sales  whereas stores closed during these same periods effectively reduced net revenues by million 
during  we expect to open approximately five flagship stores  seven large format stores  and one standard sized store and close approximately existing stores in connection with our real estate optimization strategy of evolving to having fewer  larger stores in many of our key markets 
as a result of these actions  we expect that our overall store counts will decline slightly  while our total selling square footage will increase slightly 
in addition  we will continue with our practice of monitoring the operating performance and economics of all store locations and evaluating for closure any underperforming stores when the economics favor doing so 
port supply segment net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in compared to however  sales to the wholesale customer group increased in our stores segment 
we believe the shift from port supply to stores was driven by our ongoing efforts to better serve our wholesale customers through our store locations 
net revenues from our direct to customer segment  which we formerly referred to as our direct sales segment  increased million  or  to million from higher sales through our website 
the increased sales resulted from technology upgrades completed in  expanded marketing offerings and product assortments  which drove higher traffic to 
table of contents the website and resulted in higher average order values per transaction 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for increased by  or million  compared to comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were positive across geographic regions  with the strongest growth in the southeast 
our merchandise expansion strategy resulted in positive comparable store sales across all regions  with the strongest results in the for the boater categories 
we believe the sales results by category in the southeast were consistent with higher boat usage demonstrated by higher sales of maintenance related products in that region 
also  we identified an opportunity in the southeast to expand our fishing assortments and delivered sales growth in that category 
while it appears the economy has stabilized generally  there remains some uncertainty about the market for boating supplies and related merchandise 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to higher sales 
gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a reduction in unit buying and distribution costs and a improvement in inventory shrink 
additionally  increased revenues allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed occupancy expenses by 
these improvements were partially offset by lower raw product margin  down  driven by a shift in revenues to lower margin categories  such as electronics 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for last year 
sg a decreased as a percentage of revenues to in  compared to in drivers of higher sg a expense included a million loss contingency accrual related to a recently finalized software license audit  million in higher information technology spending  including costs to implement our new point of sale and order entry systems  a variable selling expense increase of million primarily due to higher store payroll supporting the higher sales year over year  a million increase in benefits costs  including higher year over year health care claims  and a million unfavorable impact versus last year of foreign currency exchange 
these increases in sg a were partially offset by a million reduction in accrued bonus expense in due to increased bonus target thresholds  reflecting improved performance expectations when compared to the target thresholds for fiscal interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in interest expense was due to both higher commitment fees and higher average interest rates  although average outstanding bank borrowings were lower in  compared to cash provided by operating activities funded property and equipment investments with excess cash being used to pay down our seasonal use of debt 
this was the primary driver of the lower average outstanding bank borrowings in income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a provision of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance during the second quarter of  resulting in a million benefit 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
given our improved financial performance and expectations of future results  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to support the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of our effective tax rate is subject to change based on the mix of income from different state and foreign jurisdictions that tax at different rates  as well as the change in status or outcome of uncertain tax positions 
we currently anticipate the effective tax rate for fiscal year will be a provision of approximately

fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to net revenues of million for we believe that net revenues in fiscal year were favorably affected by changes in the competitive landscape that occurred during fiscal year  as well as favorable weather throughout much of the boating season 
however  we believe there was a 
table of contents general softening in the boating equipment market after the fourth of july 
our mix of business in the southeast during the second quarter was impacted by the effects of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
while not significant  we did experience a decrease in sales of merchandise typically used by recreational boaters and fishermen in the affected areas of the southeast 
however  this decrease was offset by increased sales of products to customers engaged in fighting the effects of the spill 
there did not appear to be any significant sales impact for the third and fourth quarters related to the oil spill 
net income for was million compared to net income for of million 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
a driver of the comparable store sales increase was higher sales to wholesale customers through our store locations  which we believe resulted from our ongoing efforts to better serve this group of customers through store locations 
in certain markets  our larger stores serve as regional distribution centers that offer better assortments  convenience  and competitive pricing with better service and more delivery options for wholesale customers 
the increase in net revenues was across most merchandise categories and sales benefited from our expanded assortments in clothing  as well as increased sales for electronics and maintenance related products 
real estate activity connected with our store optimization strategy drove a million increase in net revenues as stores opened during the fourth quarter of  and stores opened during generated million in sales  whereas stores closed during these same periods effectively reduced net revenues by million 
additionally  early in  we began to see signs that customers were preparing their boats for usage as reflected by our increase in sales during the first quarter of  led by growth in maintenance related products 
we also saw recovery in demand for our higher priced items  such as electronics 
port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in compared to however  sales to the wholesale customer group increased in our stores segment 
net revenues from our direct to customer segment decreased million  or  to million 
we began to see the decrease in this segment following the launch of our updated website in the second quarter of the transition to the updated site negatively affected sales 
however  this decline was temporary  and we began to see a rebound in the sales performance of this segment late in the third quarter and continuing through the fourth quarter 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for increased by  or million  compared to comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the geographic regions 
the increase in comparable store sales was across most merchandise categories and  in particular  we continued to experience increased sales for electronics and maintenance related products 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to higher sales 
gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a increase in raw product margin driven by more effective promotions  less clearance activity and a shift in revenues to higher margin core boating categories  such as maintenance 
additionally  increased revenues allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed occupancy expenses by 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for expenses as a percentage of revenues remained flat at 
drivers of the higher sg a expense included a variable selling expense increase of million primarily due to selective investments in additional staffing in our stores during the second and third quarters  our busiest quarters  a million unfavorable comparison versus fiscal year due to the impact of foreign currency exchange  million in higher information technology spending to implement our new point of sale and order entry systems  and million related to west marine university  our national sales meeting held every other year 
sg a expense in was reduced by million upon receipt of an insurance reimbursement related to costs associated with the sec investigation which closed during that year 
the increase in sg a was partially offset by a million reduction in bonus expense in when compared to store closure and other restructuring costs 
table of contents store closure and other restructuring costs for changed by million when compared to during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sublease a location which had a large associated termination obligation 
the terms of this particular agreement were more favorable than what we originally estimated and resulted in a million reversal in of the previously accrued estimated costs 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in fiscal  compared to fiscal cash provided by operating activities funded property and equipment investments with excess cash being used to pay down debt 
this was the primary driver of the lower average outstanding bank borrowings in income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a provision of  compared to a benefit of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a million benefit in related to a tax law change that increased the number of historical years in which companies are permitted to carry back prior period net operating losses 
similar to  in we were able to use timing differences that were not previously benefited due to the valuation allowance to reduce the statutory tax rate 
given that our improved financial performance had been for a limited time period combined with the continued economic uncertainty with respect to the general state of the economy and rising fuel costs  in fiscal we concluded that  while evidence related to current and future financial performance was improving  there remained sufficient economic uncertainty that it would have been premature to assert that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize all net deferred tax assets and release some or all of the partial valuation allowance

liquidity and capital resources funds generated by operating activities  available cash and our credit facility are our largest sources of cash 
our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases  occupancy costs  personnel related expenses and investments in property and equipment 
at the end of both and  we were debt free 
however  we expect to continue to borrow against our credit facility during the first half of each year as we build inventory levels in preparation for the key boating season 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  increased to million at the end of  compared to million at the end of the increase in working capital primarily was attributable to a million higher cash balance at the end of neither our access to  nor the value of  our cash equivalents was materially affected by the liquidity problems experienced by certain financial institutions over the past several years 
our cash needs for working capital are supported by a secured credit facility 
there is risk to this capital resource stemming from current market conditions in that the amount we have available to borrow under our loan agreement primarily is driven by the estimated liquidation value of our inventory 
external factors  such as increased liquidations and bankruptcies in the marketplace  could put downward pressure on this liquidation value and thus our associated borrowing availability 
however  we continue to take steps to mitigate this risk 
first  we are focusing on maximizing cash flow and minimizing borrowing needs 
we expect to accomplish this by i increasing inventory turnover  which will require lower working capital to maintain fresh and adequate inventory at our stores  ii continuing to focus on expense control  including continual re engineering efforts to simplify and streamline administrative  inventory and other business processes  and to shrink or eliminate overhead costs as and when necessary or appropriate  and iii being prudent with our capital spending and concentrating on investments with a demonstrable financial return 
second  we are improving the quality of our inventory by controlling the proportion of overstocked or discontinued goods 
third  we are maintaining communications with our lenders to keep them apprised of our business plans 
operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year by million to million in  compared to million last year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases in cash provided by net income and reduced inventory levels  partially offset by an increase in cash used for accrued expenses 
cash used for inventory was lower due primarily to our continued focus on inventory management and ensuring the correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
cash used for accrued expenses partially offset the increase in cash primarily as a result of lower accrued bonus expense given our increased bonus target thresholds in as compared to accrued bonus and related thresholds in fiscal 
table of contents during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased year over year by million to million in  compared to million in the major driver of this cash flow reduction was a million increase in merchandise inventories during  compared to a million reduction in the prior year as we focused on necessary inventory reductions in the increased inventory in was driven by our strategy to bring in additional inventory earlier in the season and to maintain safety stocks to help ensure in stock position and to help fulfill customer needs and maximize sales throughout the boating season 
a million decrease in accounts payable during  compared to a million increase in accounts payable during  also contributed to the decline in cash provided by operating activities 
capital growth in  our capital expenditures were million  primarily for new stores  store remodels  information technology and investment in supply chain efficiencies 
we opened six new stores and remodeled four stores in during  we expect to increase capital spending somewhat  primarily in support of strategic growth initiatives which include new stores  store remodels and expansions  and information technology enhancements 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  credit facility borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash provided by financing activities was million in  attributed entirely to an increase in cash related to associate share based compensation plans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million increase in cash related to associate share based compensation plans  partially offset by million in cash used to pay loan costs associated with our amended and restated loan agreement 
in august  we entered into a four year loan and security agreement pursuant to which we have up to million in borrowing capacity 
at our option and subject to certain conditions set forth in the loan agreement  we may increase our borrowing capacity up to an additional million during the term 
the amount available to be borrowed is based on a percentage of certain of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and accounts receivable 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by west marine  inc and west marine canada corp 
an indirect subsidiary of west marine  inc and secured by a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory  certain other related assets  and all proceeds thereof 
the revolving credit facility is available for general working capital and general corporate purposes 
at our election  borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at one of the following options the prime rate  which is defined in the loan agreement as the highest of a 
federal funds rate  as in effect from time to time  plus one half of one percent  b 
libor rate for a one month interest period plus one percent  or c 
the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by wells fargo as its prime rate  or the libor rate quoted by the british bankers association for the applicable interest period 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving credit facility 
the margin range for option above is between and and for option above is between and 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility available 
for  and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was  and  respectively 
although the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on our ability to incur liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets  it does not contain debt or other similar financial covenants  such as maintaining certain specific leverage  debt service or interest coverage ratios 
instead  our loan is asset based which means our lenders maintain a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable which serve as collateral for the loan  and the amount we may borrow under our revolving credit facility at any given time is determined by the estimated value of these assets as determined by the lenders appraisers 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum revolving credit availability equal to the greater of million or of the borrowing base 
in addition  there are customary events of default under our loan agreement  including failure to comply with our covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  an event of default occurs which  if not waived by our lenders or cured within the 
table of contents applicable time periods  results in the lenders having the right to accelerate repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement before the stated maturity date and the revolving credit facility could be terminated 
these events of default include  after the expiration of any applicable grace periods  payment defaults to the lenders  material inaccuracies of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  material payment defaults other than under the loan agreement  voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings  material money judgments  material erisa events  change of control and other customary defaults 
a default under our loan agreement also could significantly and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our loan agreement 
at the end of and  there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities  and we had million and million  respectively  available for future borrowings 
at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
we strategically manage our debt over the course of our fiscal year 
we incur seasonal fluctuations in our cash flows and  therefore  we incur debt as we build up our inventories for spring in order to maintain stock levels sufficient to fulfill customer needs and maximize sales during the main boating season 
additionally  we hire a significant number of temporary associates during the summer  our peak selling season 
our weighted average outstanding balances for the first quarters of and were million and million  respectively 
for our second quarters of and  the weighted average outstanding balances were million and million  respectively  and at the end of our third quarters of and  the weighted average outstanding balances were less than million and million  respectively 
the fourth quarter weighted average outstanding balances for both and were not material 
our aggregate borrowing base cannot exceed million 
our borrowing base at each of our last two fiscal year ends consisted of the following in millions accounts receivable availability inventory availability less reserves less minimum availability total borrowing base our aggregate borrowing base was reduced by the following obligations in millions ending loan balance overpayment outstanding letters of credit total obligations accordingly  our availability as of fiscal year end and  respectively  was in millions total borrowing base less obligations total availability contractual obligations aggregate information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of december  is presented in the following table in thousands 

table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations operating leases purchase commitments bank letters of credit other long term liabilities operating lease amounts in this table represent minimum amounts due under existing agreements and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments are cancelable by us without penalty  however  we do intend to honor these commitments 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
business trends our research and experience indicates that the us boating industry experienced a down cycle in  as evidenced by lower sales in each of our business segments compared to  lower new and used boat sales  and declines in boat registrations in key states 
early in  we began to see signs that customers were preparing their boats for usage  based on increased sales during the first quarter of and led by an early spring and growth in maintenance related products 
we also saw recovery in demand for our higher priced items  such as electronics 
as we progressed through  we observed that proportionately more sales growth was coming from our port supply wholesale business  particularly in sales to port supply customers through our stores 
these particular sales increases allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed store occupancy expenses 
we experienced favorable weather conditions throughout most of the boating season  however  we believe there was a general softening in the boating equipment market after the fourth of july 
during the first quarter of  we saw a decline in gross profit primarily as a result of lower product margins due to a sales mix shift toward lower margin items  such as electronics  and away from higher margin maintenance related items 
we believe this shift was caused by inclement weather in most of the country during the first half of the year  which did not prompt boaters to prepare for the key boating season as early as they did last year  when better weather prevailed during the first quarter 
we saw encouraging signs in the first quarter of  including strength in the southeastern part of the country  which was less affected by weather 
also  later in the second quarter and into the third quarter of  our general sales trend strengthened somewhat 
we believe this was due to the weather warming up to seasonal levels later in the second quarter and continuing into the third quarter  whereas many parts of the country were cooler and rainier than normal earlier in the second quarter 
the fourth quarter brought favorable weather  which we believe drove boat usage and benefited sales 
early in the year  we began to experience sales growth in higher ticket merchandise  such as electronics  and this strength carried throughout the remainder of the year 
in fiscal  we experienced double digit growth in our soft goods categories  reflecting the success of our merchandise expansion strategy  which was partially offset by lower sales when compared to in product categories that were higher in fiscal due to efforts to clean up the oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
as progressed  we saw increasing impact of our real estate optimization strategy  which drove total sales increases that exceeded comparable store sales growth 
we believe sales in the fourth quarter of also reflected success of our key item strategy 
table of contents during the holiday shopping period 
in  in addition to focusing on implementing and building upon our key strategies as outlined in the overview discussion above  we also will continue to manage our business conservatively from an operating expense standpoint  while taking steps to remain flexible and to maximize sales in the face of varying marketplace demand 
specifically  these actions will include making prudent strategic investments in additional inventory items to maintain in stock levels in the event improved sales continue  and hiring additional store associates as needed to maintain customer service levels  while leveraging payroll expense as a percentage of sales 
although we believe we have seen some recovery in customer boat usage and demand for higher priced items  we believe that the ongoing uncertainty in economic conditions has had  and will continue to have  an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending in an already challenging climate for the boating industry  and we believe that economic uncertainty could continue to have an impact on our sales  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in see the fiscal compared with fiscal segment revenues discussion included above 
for  we will continue to control expense growth and maximize cash flow by continuing to control our operating expenses through variable expense management  along with reengineering and streamlining business processes  where applicable  continuing to improve the quality of our inventory by tightly controlling overstocked or discontinued goods  proceeding with our ongoing real estate optimization program  evolving to having fewer  larger stores with anticipated improved store economics  managing the business to the budget established for  which reflects prudent investment in growth while focusing on expense control and emphasizing working capital management  and exploring methods and strategies to drive traffic  sales  conversion  and market presence 
more broadly  in order to better meet the needs of our customers and provide a better customer experience  we have invested in a strategic project to replace our aging point of sale and order management systems 
the new platform is intended to enable an integrated cross channel selling experience for the customer including faster sales checkout  improved product search capability  integrated customer information and order management  and simplified policy application 
the system has been deployed company wide  and we anticipate that additional enhancements to this system will be rolled out during critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the cost or market value on an average cost basis 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at december  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we have not made any material changes in our inventory valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory write downs at december   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at december  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment relating to factors of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we have not made any material changes in our capitalized indirect cost methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions vendor allowances receivable we establish a receivable and reduce inventory cost for income generated from vendor sponsored programs  or vendor allowances  that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level for the vendor allowances receivable 
our receivable for vendor allowances at december  and january  was million and million  respectively  and is included in other current assets 
our vendor allowances receivable contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and in interim periods requires management to estimate future inventory purchases 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor allowances receivable during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor allowances receivable 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our estimate of our ability to collect vendor allowances at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the net present value of the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
costs associated with exit activities included in accrued expenses at december  and january  were million and million  respectively 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability or to our estimated sub lease income at december  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are reviewed and evaluated quarterly 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in fiscal years and  we recorded non cash charges of less than million and million  respectively  for impairment of long lived assets 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we believe we have approximately million in net carrying value of assets held for use where an impairment charge is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we estimate our annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the year progresses  we refine the estimates of the year s taxable income as new information becomes available  including year to date financial results 
this continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate 
our effective tax rate is subject to change based on the mix of income from different state and foreign jurisdictions that tax at different rates  as well as the change in status or outcome of uncertain tax positions 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
in fiscal  we released million  representing the majority of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our effective tax rate and our income tax exposures 
the need to record or release a valuation allowance also contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment  primarily whether we will have future taxable income  to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions liabilities for self insurance or high deductible losses we are self insured for certain losses  including those related to employee healthcare 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
in other cases  we purchase commercial insurance  such as for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we insure workers compensation losses through a high deductible program  and we recognize our liability for the ultimate payment of incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses by accruing liabilities on an actuarial basis which represent estimates of future amounts necessary to pay claims and related expenses with respect to covered events that have occurred 
when estimating our liabilities relating to self insurance or high deductible insurance programs  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors and actuarial analysis 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by actuarial analysis to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
liabilities for our self insured losses or high deductible insurance programs contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have not made any material changes to our self insurance accrual methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insured liabilities and loss reserves relating to high deductible insurance programs at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan under which we award non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
we also have an associate stock buying plan 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards and associate stock buying plan purchases using similar valuation techniques and the closing market price of our common stock 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we have not made any material changes in our methodology for determining fair value of stock options during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
a change in our assumptions  such as volatility or expected term  for share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate or currency rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate or currency rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
at the end of the  we had no outstanding long term debt and as such would not be impacted by a change in interest rates 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a four year  amended and restated loan and security agreement pursuant to which the company has up to million in borrowing capacity 
there are various interest rate options available  for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
a increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
