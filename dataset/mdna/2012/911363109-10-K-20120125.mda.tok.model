item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world  with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states and canada 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because  as a larger company  we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages 
these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost oec  based on the initial consideration paid  of billion  and a national branch network that operates in states and every canadian province  and serves of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states 
in addition  our size gives us greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services  the ability to provide customers with equipment that is better maintained and therefore more productive and reliable  and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 
we offer approximately  classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners and government entities 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
in  equipment rental revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
for the past several years  we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion 
to achieve this  we have developed a strategy focused on customer segmentation  rate management  fleet management and disciplined cost control 
additionally  we are continuing to strengthen our competitiveness through customer service excellence 
this strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single point of contact  an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts  and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets 
although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the us equipment rental industry in  we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy 
for the full year  compared with  these achievements included a percent increase in rental rates  a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent  a percentage point increase in time utilization on a larger fleet  an increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from national account customers  from percent in to percent in national accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least  or customers doing business in multiple locations  continued improvement in customer service management  including an increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from accounts that are managed by a single point of contact from percent in to percent in establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory 
additionally  we expanded our centralized ccc 
the ccc  which established a second base of operations in  handled percent more rental reservations in  the continued optimization of our network of rental locations  including an increase in of  or percent  in the number of our trench safety  power and hvac rental locations  and a percentage point improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
in  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process  the strengthening of our customer service capabilities  and sustained cost efficiencies 
additionally  we will focus on leveraging technology and training to improve rental rate performance and optimize the transportation of our rental equipment to and from customer jobsites  further increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from national accounts and other large customers through customer segmentation 
to the extent that we are successful  we believe that we can improve our equipment rental gross margin and overall profitability over time  as large accounts tend to rent equipment for longer periods and can be serviced more cost effectively than short term transactional customers  accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace  where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage 
additionally  industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand  making our aggregate end markets less volatile  and further capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin power and climate control equipment rented by our trench 
table of contents safety  power and hvac business 
in  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators  we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover at a modest pace 
specifically  we estimate that us spending on private non residential construction  our primary end market  will show a single digit percentage increase over proposed acquisition of rsc as discussed elsewhere in this report  on december   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with rsc  pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire rsc in a cash and stock transaction that ascribes a total enterprise value of billion to rsc 
total cash consideration is expected to be approximately billion and we anticipate issuing approximately million shares of common stock in the merger 
the cash portion of the merger will be financed through new debt issuances and drawing on current loan facilities 
in connection with the proposed merger  we intend to re pay the outstanding amounts on rsc s existing senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes due  which totaled as of september   and assume all of rsc s remaining billion of unsecured debt after such repayment 
the proposed merger is subject to approval by our stockholders and rsc stockholders  regulatory approvals and other mutual conditions of the parties 
we expect the merger to close in the first half of financial overview despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions  and as discussed elsewhere in this report  we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in and related to our capital structure  and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity 
for instance  most recently  in october  we amended our abl facility 
the amended facility  which expires on october   provides for  among other things  an increase in the facility size from billion to billion  an uncommitted incremental increase in the size of the facility of up to  and generally lower borrowing costs 
additionally  in september  we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the amended facility expires on september  and may be extended on a day basis by mutual agreement of the company and the purchasers under the facility 
the amended facility provides for  among other things  a decrease in the facility size from to  adjustments to the receivables subject to purchase  and generally lower borrowing costs 
as of december   we had available liquidity of  including cash of income loss from continuing operations 
income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  income loss from continuing operations diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations income loss from continuing operations and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  include the impacts of the following special items amounts presented on an after tax basis year ended december  contribution to income from continuing operations after tax impact on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations contribution to loss from continuing operations after tax impact on diluted loss per share from continuing operations contribution to loss from continuing operations after tax impact on diluted loss per share from continuing operations rsc merger related costs restructuring charge losses gains on repurchase retirement of debt securities and subordinated convertible debentures  and abl amendment asset impairment charge this reflects transaction costs associated with the proposed acquisition of rsc discussed above

ebitda represents the sum of net income loss  loss from discontinued operation  net of taxes  provision benefit for income taxes  interest expense  net  interest expense subordinated convertible debentures  net  depreciation of rental equipment and non rental depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the rsc merger related costs  the restructuring charge and stock compensation expense  net 
these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time  as well as with those of other similar companies 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda  when viewed with the company s results under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the accompanying reconciliation  provide useful information about operating performance and period over period growth  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

revenues 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows 
table of contents year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenue total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment 
contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other revenue includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects a percent increase in equipment rentals  which was primarily due to a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a percent rental rate increase  and a percent increase in sales of rental equipment  which was primarily due to increased volume  improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold 
rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates  weighted by the current period revenue mix 
total revenues of billion decreased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the decrease primarily reflects a percent decline in sales of rental equipment and a percent decline in contractor supplies sales 
equipment rental revenue increased slightly as a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent was largely offset by a percent decrease in rental rates and other 
the decline in sales of rental equipment in primarily reflects a decline in the volume of equipment sold 
the decline in contractor supplies sales in reflects a reduction in the volume of supplies sold  partially offset by improved pricing and product mix driven by our continued focus on higher margin products 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are hourly  daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by the monthly term of days 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
in any given accounting period  we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
for instance  continuing the above example  if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december and returned it at the close of business on january  we would recognize incremental revenue on january of in actual dollars  representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straight line basis 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we had deferred revenue of and as of december  and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate 
table of contents of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes 
write offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 
useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to percent of cost 
costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment 
the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues  such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness 
in addition  the salvage value  which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness  is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
similarly  to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual non rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  including rental equipment and property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized asset impairment charges of  and  respectively  in our general rentals segment 
the and impairment charges primarily reflected write offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the consolidation of our branch network discussed below  and are primarily reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the impairment charge includes rental fleet impairment of reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  as well as primarily related to leasehold improvement write offs which are reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the impairment charges followed from our decision to consolidate our branch network 
we have reduced our branch count by an aggregate of branches between january  the beginning of the restructuring period discussed in restructuring charge below and december  as of december  and  there were no held for sale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business  each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold 
we select these assets  which represented approximately three percent of our total rental assets at december   as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment 
as part of this impairment review  we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels  the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives 
additionally  we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition 
based on our most recently completed december  quarterly review  there was no impairment associated with these assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the 
table of contents reversals of existing temporary differences  and tax planning strategies 
after consideration of all these factors  we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them 
the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 
we use a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
as discussed below  during the fourth quarters of  and  we recognized a benefit of  a charge of and a charge of  respectively  related to our provision for self insurance reserves 
legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  power and hvac 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we aggregate our seven geographic regions the southwest  gulf  northwest  southeast  midwest  east  and the northeast canada into our general rentals reporting segment 
historically  there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions 
for instance  for the five year period ended december   certain of our regions had equipment rentals gross margin that varied by between percent and percent from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
although the margins for these regions exceeded a percent variance level for this five year period  we expect convergence going forward given management s focus on cost cutting  improved processes and fleet sharing 
although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate  to 
table of contents the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge  we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments 
any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 
our revenues  operating results  and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers  with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 
revenues by segment were as follows general rentals trench safety  power and hvac total year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals

liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital markets activity 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
during  we purchased an aggregate of of quips for in connection with this transaction  we retired principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures and recognized a loss of  inclusive of the write off of 
table of contents capitalized debt issuance costs 
this loss is reflected in interest expense subordinated convertible debentures  net in our consolidated statements of income 
during  we also recognized a loss of less than associated with the conversion of of our percent convertible senior notes 
this loss is reflected in interest expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in september  we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the amended facility expires on september  and may be extended on a day basis by mutual agreement of the company and the purchasers under the facility 
the amended facility provides for  among other things  a decrease in the facility size from to  adjustments to the receivables subject to purchase  and generally lower borrowing costs 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in october  we amended our abl facility 
the amended facility  which expires on october   provides for  among other things  an increase in the facility size from billion to billion  an uncommitted incremental increase in the size of the facility of up to  and generally lower borrowing costs 
we recognized a loss of in interest expense  net in our consolidated statements of income in connection with the amendment of our abl facility 
total debt at december  increased by  or percent  as compared to december   primarily due to additional borrowings used to finance capital expenditures and the company s acquisitions 
current maturities of long term debt at december  primarily reflect of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and of percent convertible senior notes 
the percent convertible senior notes mature in  but are reflected as short term debt because they are convertible at december  our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity  net of of letters of credit  available under the abl facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of cash equivalents at december  consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better 
we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next months 
as of december   and were outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility  respectively 
the interest rates applicable to the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility at december  were percent and percent  respectively 
during the year ended december   the monthly average amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility  including both the former facilities and the amended facilities  were and  respectively  and the weighted average interest rates thereon were percent and percent  respectively 
the maximum month end amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility  including both the former facilities and the amended facilities  during the year ended december  were and  respectively 
the amount outstanding at year end under the abl facility exceeded the average amount outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings used to finance capital expenditures and the company s acquisitions 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next months will be to fund i cash consideration payable in the merger with rsc and the repayment of rsc s senior secured debt  ii operating activities and working capital  iii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iv payments due under operating leases  v debt service  and vi other acquisitions 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash and  in the case of the cash consideration for the rsc acquisition and the repayment of rsc s senior secured debt  the incurrence of new debt 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate  the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
to access the capital markets  we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets 
credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions  including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions 
as a result  negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding 
our credit ratings as of january  were as follows corporate rating outlook moody s b stable standard poor s b positive fitch b stable a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
there is no assurance that any rating will remain 
table of contents in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment and  if required  borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in relative to net rental capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were and in and  respectively 
we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in relative to loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility  the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior notes and the quips 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in october  we amended our abl facility 
the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility 
subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility  these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and since the october amendment of the facility and through december   availability under the facility has exceeded the required threshold and  as a result  these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable 
under our accounts receivable securitization facility  we are required  among other things  to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio  ii the delinquency ratio  iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 
as of december   primarily due to losses sustained in prior years  urna had limited restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness 
although this limited capacity restricts our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings  because of certain intercompany arrangements  we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings ability to meet its cash obligations 
sources and uses of cash 
during  we i generated cash from operating activities of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received cash from debt proceeds  net of payments  of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of and ii purchase other companies for during  we i generated cash from operations of  including related to a federal tax refund  and ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of and ii fund payments  net of proceeds  on debt of free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december  was  a decrease of as compared to for the year ended december  as noted above  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included a federal tax refund 
excluding the impact of this refund  free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased 
table of contents purchases of rental equipment  partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment 
in  free cash flow decreased compared to excluding the impact of the refund noted above  the year over year decrease in free cash flow primarily reflected increased purchases of rental equipment and reduced proceeds from sales of rental equipment 
certain information concerning contractual obligations 
the table below provides certain information concerning the payments coming due under certain categories of our existing contractual obligations as of december  thereafter total debt and capital leases interest due on debt operating leases real estate non rental equipment service agreements purchase obligations subordinated convertible debentures total the payments due with respect to a period represent i in the case of debt and capital leases  the scheduled principal payments due in such period  and ii in the case of operating leases  the minimum lease payments due in such period under non cancelable operating leases plus the maximum potential guarantee amounts associated with some of our non rental equipment operating leases for which we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
our percent convertible senior notes mature in  but are reflected as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet because they are convertible at december  the percent convertible senior notes are reflected in the table above based on the contractual maturity date in estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of december  as discussed above  our percent convertible senior notes mature in  but are reflected as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet because they are convertible at december  interest on the percent convertible senior notes is reflected in the table above based on the contractual maturity date in these represent service agreements with third parties to provide wireless and network services  refurbish our aerial equipment and operate the distribution centers associated with contractor supplies 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase orders  which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business  with our equipment and inventory suppliers 
these purchase commitments can be cancelled by us  generally with days notice and without cancellation penalties 
the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers for these purchases and related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout the total purchase obligations increased from at december  to at december   primarily due to improvements in our operating environment and a consequent increase in capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures increased from in to in represents principal and interest payments on the of percent subordinated convertible debentures reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  this information excludes of unrecognized tax benefits  which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
it is not possible to estimate the time period during which these unrecognized tax benefits may be paid to tax authorities 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
we lease real estate and non rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity 
as part of some of our non rental equipment operating leases  we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero  then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees  however  we cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated 
this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  or any prior date as we believe that proceeds from the sale of the equipment under these operating leases would approximate the payment obligation 
relationship between holdings and urna 
holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its 
table of contents operations through its wholly owned subsidiary  urna  and subsidiaries of urna 
holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations 
these services principally include i senior management services  ii finance and tax related services and support  iii information technology systems and support  iv acquisition related services  v legal services  and vi human resource support 
in addition  holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt  ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations and iii equity price risk associated with our convertible debt 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  comprised of of borrowings under the abl facility and of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the abl facility and ii percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates  including our subordinated convertible debentures 
a one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of december  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately five percent 
for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt  see notes see fair value of financial instruments and to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would cause our annual after tax earnings to change by approximately as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  during the year ended december   we recognized foreign currency losses of associated with the revaluation of certain canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans  however these losses were offset by gains of recognized on forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars  and the aggregate foreign currency impact of the intercompany loans and forward contracts did not have a material impact on our earnings 
we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
equity price risk 
in connection with the november percent convertible notes offering  holdings entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties 
the convertible note hedge transactions cost  and decreased additional paid in capital by  net of taxes  in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit 
the convertible note hedge transactions cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments  million shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedge transactions are intended to reduce  subject to a limit  the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the percent convertible notes 
the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to increase the effective conversion price to per share  equal to an approximately percent premium over the closing price of our common stock at issuance 
the effective conversion price is subject to change in certain circumstances  such as if the percent convertible notes are converted prior to may  in the event the market value of our common stock exceeds the effective conversion price per share  the settlement amount received from such transactions will only partially offset the potential dilution 
for example  if  at the time of exercise of the conversion right  the price of our common stock was or per share  assuming an effective conversion price of per share  on a net basis  we would issue million or million shares  respectively 
based on the price of our common stock during  holders of the percent convertible notes had the right to convert the notes during each of the quarters in at a conversion price of per share of common stock 
during the year ended december   of the percent convertible notes were converted at an effective conversion price of 
upon conversion of these notes  we received from the hedge counterparties  and recognized a increase in additional paid in capital 
additionally  upon conversion of these notes  additional paid in capital was reduced by  reflecting the excess of the cash transferred upon settlement over the principal amount of the converted notes 
based on the price of our common stock during the fourth quarter of  holders of the percent convertible notes have the right to convert the notes during the first quarter of at a conversion price of per share of common stock 
between january  the beginning of the first quarter and january   none of the percent convertible senior notes were converted 

table of contents if the total outstanding principal amount of the percent convertible notes was converted  the total cost to settle the notes would be  assuming a conversion price of the closing price of our common stock on december  per share of common stock 
the principal amount would be settled in cash  and the remaining could be settled in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof  at our discretion 
based on the december  closing stock price  approximately million shares of stock would be issued if we settled the entire of conversion value in excess of the principal amount in stock 
the total cost to settle would change approximately for each actual dollars change in our stock price 
if the full principal amount was converted at our december  closing stock price  we estimate that we would receive approximately in either cash or stock from the hedge counterparties  after which the effective conversion price would be approximately 
additionally  principal amount of our percent convertible notes were outstanding at december  if the total outstanding principal amount of the percent convertible notes was converted  the total cost to settle the notes would be  assuming a conversion price of the closing price of our common stock on december  per share of common stock 
the total cost to settle would change approximately for each actual dollars change in our stock price 
the percent convertible notes were not convertible at december
