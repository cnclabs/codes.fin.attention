overview we offer our customers one source for asset protection solutions and are a leading global provider of technology enabled asset protection solutions used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy  industrial and public infrastructure 
we combine industry leading products and technologies  expertise in mechanical integrity mi and non destructive testing ndt services  predictive maintenance pdm services  proprietary data analysis and enterprise inspection warehousing software to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of customized solutions  ranging from routine inspections to complex  plant wide asset integrity management and assessments 
these mission critical solutions enhance our customers ability to comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations  extend the useful life of their assets  increase productivity  minimize repair costs  manage risk and avoid catastrophic disasters 
given the role our solutions play in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of infrastructure  we have historically provided a majority of our services to our customers on a regular  recurring basis 
we serve a global customer base of companies with asset intensive infrastructure  including companies in the oil and gas downstream  midstream  upstream and petrochemical  natural gas  fossil and nuclear power  transmission and distribution  alternative and renewable energy  public infrastructure  chemicals  aerospace and defense  transportation  primary metals and metalworking  pharmaceutical biotechnology  food processing industries and research and engineering institutions 
as of may   we had approximately  employees  including approximately phd s and other degreed engineers and certified technicians  in approximately offices across countries 
we have established long term relationships as a critical solutions provider to many of the leading companies in our target markets 
the following chart represents the percentage of consolidated revenues we generated from our various markets for fiscal for the last several years  we have focused on introducing our advanced asset protection solutions to our customers using proprietary  technology enabled software and testing instruments  including those developed by our products and systems segment 
during this period  the demand for outsourced asset protection solutions  in general  has increased  creating demand from which our entire industry has benefited 
we believe continued growth can be realized in all of our target markets 
concurrent with this growth  we have worked to build our infrastructure to profitably absorb additional growth and have made a number of small acquisitions in an effort to leverage our fixed costs  grow our base of experienced  certified personnel  expand our product and technical capabilities and increase our geographical reach 
we have increased our capabilities and the size of our customer base through the development of applied technologies and managed support services  organic growth and the integration of acquired companies 
these acquisitions have provided us with additional products  technologies  resources and customers that we believe will enhance our advantages over our competition 
the global economy continues to be fragile 
global financial markets continue to experience uncertainty  including tight liquidity and credit availability  relatively low consumer confidence  slow economic growth  persistently high unemployment rates  volatile currency exchange rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability 
however  we believe these conditions have allowed us to capitalize on an opportunity to selectively hire new talented individuals that otherwise might not have been available to us  to acquire and develop new technologies in order to aggressively expand our proprietary portfolio of customized solutions  and to make acquisitions of complementary businesses at reasonable valuations 
basis of presentation consolidated results of operations our three operating segments are services 
this segment provides asset protection solutions primarily in north america with the largest concentration in the united states  consisting primarily of non destructive testing and inspection services that are used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy  industrial and public infrastructure 
products and systems 
this segment designs  manufactures  sells  installs and services our asset protection products and systems  including equipment and instrumentation  predominantly in the united states 

table of contents international 
this segment offers services  products and systems similar to those of our other segments to global markets  principally in europe  the middle east  africa  asia and south america  but not to customers in china and south korea  which are served by our products and systems segment 
general corporate services  including accounting  audit  legal  payroll  information technology  human resources and contract management  are provided to the segments and are reported as intersegment transactions within corporate and eliminations 
sales to the international segment from the products and systems segment and subsequent sales by the international segment of the same items are recorded and reflected in the operating performance of both segments 
additionally  engineering charges and royalty fees charged to the services and international segments by the products and systems segment are reflected in the operating performance of each segment 
all such intersegment transactions are eliminated in corporate and eliminations 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
segment income from operations is evaluated based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer  the chief operating decision maker  to assess the performance of each business in a given period and to make decisions as to resource allocations 
in connection with that assessment  the chief executive officer may exclude items such as charges for stock based compensation and certain other acquisition related charges and balances  technology and product development costs  certain gains and losses from dispositions  and litigation settlements or other charges 
certain general and administrative costs such as human resources  information technology and training are allocated to the segments 
segment income from operations also excludes interest and other financial charges and income taxes 
corporate and other assets are comprised principally of cash  deposits  property  plant and equipment  domestic deferred taxes  deferred charges and other assets 
corporate loss from operations consists of depreciation on the corporate office facilities and equipment  administrative charges related to corporate personnel and other charges that cannot be readily identified for allocation to a particular segment 
statement of operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 
revenues our revenues are generated by sales of our services  products and systems 
the majority of our revenues are derived under time and materials contracts for specified asset protection services on a project by project basis 
the duration of our projects vary depending on their scope 
some of our projects last from a few weeks to a few months  but the more significant projects can last for more than a year and can require long term deployment of substantial personnel  equipment and resources 
the start date of our projects can be postponed or delayed and the duration of our projects can be shortened or increased due to a variety of factors beyond our control 
in addition to the timing of these projects and the seasonality of our business  the amount and origination of our revenues often vary from period to period 
a percentage of our revenues are usually attributable to recurring work from our existing customers 
although our top ten customers are responsible for a large percentage of our revenues  we generate our revenues from most of these customers by providing asset protection solutions to a number of their business locations 
decisions regarding the purchase of our solutions by these customers are made either on a corporate basis or on a location by location basis 
also included in our revenues are software license fees and product sales  as well as an estimate for potential sales returns and customer allowances 
revenues under our time and materials services contracts are based on the hours of service we provide our customers at negotiated rates  plus any actual costs of materials and other direct expenses that we incur on the project  which may include markups 
because these expenses  such as travel and lodging or subcontracted services  can change significantly from project to project  changes in our revenues may not be indicative of business trends 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues includes our direct compensation and related benefits to support our sales  together with reimbursable costs  materials consumed or used in manufacturing our products and certain overhead costs  such as non billable time  equipment rentals  fringe benefits and repair and maintenance 
depreciation included in gross profit our depreciation represents the expense charge for our capitalized assets 
depending on the nature of the original item capitalized  these depreciation expenses are reported in one of two places in our statement of operations 
depreciation used in determining gross profit is directly related to our revenues and primarily relates to depreciation of equipment used for the delivery of our asset protection solutions and to a lesser extent depreciation of manufacturing equipment 
we also have other depreciation primarily related to our corporate headquarters which is included in deriving our income from operations as discussed below 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit equals our revenues less our cost of revenues and attributable depreciation 
our gross profit  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  can vary based on our volume  sales mix  actual manufacturing costs and our utilization of labor 
as a result  gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter 
for instance  the seasonality of our business can cause our gross profit to decline during traditionally slower first and third quarters when we incur labor costs without any corresponding revenues 
under our time and materials contracts  we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project 
our profit margins on time and materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates 
in recent years  there has been an increasing demand for asset protection solutions and at times  a limited supply of certified technicians 
accordingly  we have experienced increases in our cost of labor in our services segment 
the customers of our services segment have been aware of these supply constraints and generally have  to some extent  accepted corresponding price increases for our services 
however  in the current economic environment we have experienced certain pricing pressures from customers and we are uncertain whether our ability to increase prices for our services will continue 
in our products and systems segment  our ability to increase prices for any product or system to offset associated cost increases is based principally on the extent to which it incorporates our proprietary technology 
we believe our efforts to develop and offer our customer s value added proprietary solutions instead of commodity type products help us  in part  to resist margin erosion 
our international segment offers services  products and systems similar to those of our other segments  so our ability to increase prices in this segment as costs increase is determined by the same factors affecting the pricing of our other segments  and the relative mix of services  products and systems it provides in the applicable period 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised primarily of expenses of our sales and marketing operations  field location administrative costs and our corporate headquarters related to our executive  general management  finance  accounting and administrative functions and legal fees and expenses 
these costs can vary based on our volume of business or as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives such as training 
the largest single category is salaries and related costs 
in the near term  we expect these expenses to increase as we support the growth of our business and expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company 
we also expect that our sg a expenses will decline as a percentage of our revenues  particularly over the long term 
research and engineering research and engineering expense consists primarily of engineering salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products  materials and outside services used in our process and product development activities primarily in our products and systems segment 
other research and development is conducted worldwide in our services segment by various billable personnel and our management on a collaborative basis 
these costs are not separated and are included in cost of revenues 
specific development costs on software are capitalized and amortized in our depreciation and amortization included in our income from operations 
from time to time  we receive minor grants or contracts for paid research which are recorded in our revenues with the related costs included in cost of revenues 
we expect to continue our investment in research and engineering activities and anticipate that our associated expense will increase in absolute terms in the future as we hire additional personnel and increase research and engineering activity 
however  as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and engineering expense to decline over the long term 
depreciation and amortization included in income from operations our depreciation and amortization used in deriving our income from operations represents the expense charge for our capitalized assets  and primarily relates to buildings and improvements  including our corporate headquarters  office furniture  equipment  intangibles and other capital assets acquired as part of our acquisitions of other businesses 
the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  non competition agreements  customer lists and trade names  while the other capital assets acquired are primarily machinery and equipment 
to the extent we ascribe value to identifiable intangible assets that have finite lives  we amortize those values over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
fixed assets acquired are depreciated over their useful lives and charged to cost of revenues 
such depreciation and amortization expense  although non cash  directly impacts our results of operations 
it is difficult to predict with any precision the amount of expense we may record relating to future acquired intangible and other assets 

table of contents income from operations our income from operations is our gross profit less our sg a expenses  research and engineering  depreciation and amortization  acquisition related costs and reserve for legal settlements included in income from operations 
we refer to our income from operations as a percentage of our revenues as our operating margin 
interest expense our interest expense consists primarily of interest paid to our lenders under our credit agreement and our capital leases 
also included is interest on subordinated notes issued as part of our acquisitions  interest accretion from the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions  and interest incurred related to interest rate swap contracts  when applicable 
income taxes income tax expense varies as a function of pre tax income  tax rates  and the level of non deductible expenses  such as certain amounts of meals and entertainment expense  valuation allowances and other permanent differences 
as of may  we had approximately million of state net operating loss carry forwards nols available to offset state taxable income in future years 
these state nol s will expire  if not utilized  at varying dates beginning in depending on the laws of each state 
at may   we have recorded a valuation allowance of less than million against certain state deferred income tax assets based on our assessment that the respective deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
in addition we have net operating losses in certain of our foreign jurisdictions 
at may   we have a valuation allowance of approximately million against certain foreign deferred income tax assets based on our assessment that the respective deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly over the next few years due to many variables including the amount and future geographic distribution of our pre tax income  changes resulting from our acquisition strategy  and increases or decreases in our permanent differences 
noncontrolling interest  net of taxes the noncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests of other stockholders in our international subsidiaries  where ownership is not permitted or de minimis local ownership is helpful for business purposes

we estimate that our organic growth rate  as compared to growth driven by acquisitions  was approximately in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  we estimate that organic growth by segment was approximately for our products and systems segment  for our services segment  and for our international segment 
in fiscal  we estimate that growth from acquisitions was million  or approximately  compared to million  or  in fiscal we completed eleven acquisitions in fiscal compared to five acquisitions in fiscal we continued to experience growth in many of our target markets in fiscal the largest dollar increase was attributable to customers in the global oil and gas market on several new and existing projects  including an increase in our portfolio of run and maintain contracts and new work obtained due to our acquisitions 
overall  our revenues from the oil and gas market grew approximately in fiscal and provided approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively  with the largest increase coming from the downstream section of the oil and gas industry 
we also experienced growth in several of our other target markets outside of oil and gas  including industrial  process industries which include chemical and pharmaceutical  infrastructure  power generation and aerospace and defense markets 
taken as a group  revenues for all target markets other than oil and gas grew approximately over the prior year 
our top ten customers represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal our largest customer in both periods was bp plc bp  accounting for approximately and of our revenues in fiscal and  respectively

cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues was approximately and in fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation expense included in the determination of gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the basis point decrease in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of revenues generated during the year  and higher unbillable labor 
revenues from the oil and gas industry increased approximately during fiscal and represented approximately of total revenues 
revenue from this industry tends to have lower gross margins than other industries due to the existence of longer term contracts which typically have a high concentration of lower margin  traditional ndt services 
unbillable labor includes professional training time for our technicians which increased as a result of an increase in technicians in fiscal compared to fiscal unbillable labor increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal offsetting the impact of higher revenues from the oil and gas industry was revenue growth in all other industries of approximately in fiscal  where gross margins tend to be higher 
in addition  revenues from advanced ndt services  which have higher margins than traditional ndt services  increased more than during fiscal and now represents approximately of our services segment revenues compared to approximately in fiscal 
table of contents income from operations 
our income from operations by segment for fiscal  and  was as follows for the year ended may  in thousands income from operations services products and systems international corporate and eliminations income from operations by operating segment includes intercompany transactions  which are eliminated in corporate and eliminations 
our income from operations of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our income from operations was approximately and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this amount  sg a for recent acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were approximately in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in expense was primarily due to the cost of additional salary and other infrastructure costs to support our growth in revenues  including the addition of new locations and personnel in connection with our acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions  our sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses of million over the prior year attributed to normal compensation increases  including incentive compensation  as well as our investment in additional management and corporate staff to support our growth 
other increases in sg a expenses  excluding acquisitions  included stock compensation costs of approximately million  insurance expense of million  and occupancy expense of million 
depreciation and amortization included in the determination of income from operations for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  each being of revenues 
our acquisition related costs for fiscal were approximately million and related to professional fees and other expenses in connection with our fiscal acquisition activity 
these amounts were offset by approximately million in adjustments to the estimated fair value of certain acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities 
acquisition related costs for fiscal were insignificant 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase primarily related to an increase in average borrowings in the current year as well as interest accretion from the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions 
net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of taxes 
the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal relates primarily to a net loss from our french subsidiaries offset by an increase in net income of our u 
k subsidiaries 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the impact of permanent tax differences  lower foreign taxes  and a release of a valuation allowance offset by an increase in state taxes 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc and net income attributable to common shareholders 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc and net income attributable to common shareholders for fiscal was million  or of revenues  an increase of million over fiscal  which was million  or of revenues 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of our revenue growth  offset in part by higher sg a and acquisition related expenses and an increase to our provision for income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of growth in all our segments 
for fiscal and fiscal  we estimate that our organic growth rate  as compared to growth driven by acquisitions  was approximately and  respectively 
in fiscal  we estimate that organic growth by segment was approximately for our products and systems segment  for our services segment and for our international segment 
this organic growth was driven by an increase in demand for our inspection services coupled with an increase in seasonal turn around maintenance activity from our run and maintain or evergreen contracts at oil refineries 
in fiscal  we estimate that growth from acquisitions was million  
table of contents or approximately  compared to million  or  in fiscal we completed five acquisitions in fiscal compared to three acquisitions in fiscal  increasing our capabilities and adding to our base of qualified technicians 
we continued to experience growth in many of our target markets in fiscal as compared to fiscal the largest dollar increase was attributable to customers in the global oil and gas market on several new and existing projects  including an increase in our portfolio of run and maintain contracts and new work obtained due to our acquisitions 
overall  our revenues from the oil and gas market grew approximately in fiscal and provided approximately and of our total revenues for fiscal and  respectively  with the largest increase coming from the petrochemical section of the oil and gas industry 
in addition  we also experienced high growth in several of our other target markets outside of oil and gas  including industrial  and aerospace and defense markets 
taken as a group  all target markets other than oil and gas grew approximately over the prior year 
our top ten customers represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal our largest customer  bp  accounted for approximately of our revenues in both fiscal and no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal our gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our gross profit was approximately in fiscal and cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues was approximately in fiscal and depreciation expense included in the determination of gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
also included in cost of revenues is an increase to our provision for slow moving inventory of million in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the increase in our fiscal revenues  our gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained at approximately 
this is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of revenues generated during the year  as well as better utilization of direct labor 
for example  revenues from the oil and gas industry increased approximately during fiscal and represented approximately of total revenues 
the revenue from this industry often has lower gross margins than other industries because these contracts tend to be longer and have a high concentration of traditional ndt services 
as a result of these lower margins revenue growth in this category tends to decrease overall gross margins 
offsetting the impact of higher revenues from the oil and gas industry was revenue growth in all other industries of approximately in fiscal advanced ndt services  which have higher margins than traditional ndt services  increased more than during fiscal and now represents approximately of our services segment revenues compared to approximately in fiscal our revenue growth is also attributable to sales from new contracts  which drive market share growth but are competitive from a pricing perspective in the short term 
while these competitive pricing contracts remain a focus of many of our new and existing services segment customers  we were able to improve our gross profit as a percentage of revenues by focusing on utilization rates of our service technicians and other controllable costs of revenues 
these costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to approximately during fiscal from approximately during fiscal historically  by introducing more advanced ndt tools to our services segment customers  margins will increase 
another contributing factor for the decreases in fiscal and compared to was the economic downturn which continued to impact fiscal and we experienced revenue declines in shop work and industrial markets  which have higher margins than our traditional ndt services 
during fiscal  certain of our customers managed project activity and turnarounds differently than in the past  stopping or changing planned work schedules more abruptly 
this created inefficiencies in the planning and utilization of labor 
in fiscal we continued to develop several new specialties within our asset protection solutions by hiring and training new employees and creating centers of excellence  including centers for industrial tube and off shore oil rig platform inspections and new pipeline construction 
this investment in our technicians to gain future market share  however  contributes to non billable labor until these markets develop 
our income from operations of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  our income from operations increased to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were approximately in fiscal and fiscal our sg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in expense was primarily due to the cost of additional salary and other infrastructure costs to support our growth in revenues  including the addition of new locations and personnel in connection with our acquisitions 
overall  our sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses of million over the prior year attributed to normal compensation increases  including incentive compensation  as well as our investment in additional management and corporate staff to support our growth including support of the development of new and existing centers of excellence 
our recent acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the total increase in sg a expenses 
other increases in sg a expenses included stock compensation costs of approximately million  professional service and consulting costs of approximately million  and a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in our provision for bad debts of approximately million 
income from operations was also negatively impacted by a legal provision of million in fiscal as compared to a reversal of a legal 
table of contents provision of million in fiscal depreciation and amortization included in the determination of income from operations for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  each being of revenues 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal interest expense related primarily to the maturity of our interest rate swap agreement in november net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of taxes 
the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal relates primarily to a net loss from diapac  our subsidiary in russia  offset by an increase in net income of our brazilian subsidiary  pasa 
in fiscal  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily attributable to net income from diapac and pasa 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the impact of permanent tax differences and higher foreign taxes offset by a decrease in state taxes and a decrease relating to our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
net income attributable to mistras group  inc net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal was million  or approximately of revenues  an increase of million over net income attributable to mistras group  inc for fiscal  which was million  or approximately of revenues 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of our revenue growth  and lower interest and research and engineering expenses  offset by higher sg a expenses and increases to our legal provision and provision for income taxes

over the last three years  the largest increase in our total revenues was from our services segment 
revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our services revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to organic growth of approximately and growth from acquisitions of approximately 
the industries primarily contributing to this growth were oil and gas  industrial and power generation  with the largest growth in dollars coming from the oil and gas industry 
customers in the oil and gas industry 
table of contents accounted for approximately and of our services segment revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we also have experienced growth in most of our other target markets due to strong demand  the addition of new customers and increasing revenues from existing customers 
we increased our revenues to existing customers by increasing our penetration on existing service offerings and providing different types of asset protection solutions 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately and of our services segment revenues during fiscal and  respectively 
one customer  bp  represented approximately and for our revenues for our services segment in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from bp  as well as most of our larger oil and gas customers  are generated from numerous contracts and at multiple sites 
in fiscal  our services revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to organic growth of approximately and growth from acquisitions of approximately 
the increased sales activity was driven by base growth in manpower requirements  turn around activities inside our evergreen contracts and several new multi year contracts we entered into this year 
the industries contributing to this growth were oil and gas  chemical and power generation with the largest growth in dollars coming from the oil and gas industry  in both the downstream and midstream segments 
customers in the oil and gas industry accounted for approximately and of our services segment revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
our services segment gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal  which was million 
the modest decrease of basis points in gross margin from the previous year is primarily due to the mix of revenues generated in the year and higher unbillable labor  as well as the pricing pressure from large master service agreements with larger oil and gas customers that drive our base revenues up while being awarded at competitive pricing 
cost of revenues  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of revenues was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
for fiscal   and depreciation expense included in gross profit was million   and million respectively  each representing approximately of revenues 
we continued to invest in additional field test equipment and fleet vehicles  which generate depreciation expense  to support our growth and reduce other operating costs  such as repairs and maintenance 
our services segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of services revenues  an increase of million over fiscal  which was million  or of revenues 
the modest increase of basis points in gross margin from the previous year was attributable  in part  to the continued pricing pressure from large master service agreements with larger oil and gas customers 
while competitive pricing contracts remain a focus of many of our services segment customers  we were able to improve our gross profit as a percentage of revenues by focusing on utilization rates of our service technicians and other controllable costs of revenues 
income from operations 
our income from operations from our services segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to fiscal sg a expenses in our services segment increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing approximately and of segment revenues  respectively 
of this amount  sg a for recent acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
the services segment sg a expenses included higher compensation and benefit expenses  excluding acquisitions  of million over the prior year attributed to normal compensation increases  including incentive compensation  and the cost of additional salary to support our growth in revenues 
other significant increases in sg a expenses  excluding acquisitions  in fiscal include insurance expense of million and occupancy expenses of million 
depreciation and amortization expense used in determining income from operations was approximately million in both fiscal and fiscal and million in fiscal  representing approximately   and of revenues  respectively 
additionally  we adjusted the fair value of certain acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities 
for fiscal  the adjustments to the estimated fair value of certain acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities decreased income from operations by approximately million 
the fair value adjustments to acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities have been classified as acquisition related costs in the statement of operations for fiscal acquisition related costs for the fiscal acquisition activity were insignificant 
our income from operations from our services segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment revenues  our income from operations increased to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal sg a expenses in our services segment increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  each representing approximately of segment revenues

our products and systems segment gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment revenues  our gross profit was approximately and in fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation expense used in determining gross profit for each of the fiscal years and was million  or of segment revenues 
the gross margin percentage decrease of basis points in fiscal is attributable to a change in the mix of revenues during fiscal the gross profit in our products and systems segment can fluctuate depending on volume and product mix 
for example  our ultrasonic ndt solutions require custom product engineering  large  expensive components and the use of subcontractors in the fabrication of large structures utilized to facilitate testing 
the utilization of subcontractors and use of high cost parts in these systems often yield lower gross margins 
our products and systems segment gross profit increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment revenues  our gross profit was approximately and  in fiscal and  respectively 
an acquisition completed in fiscal contributed million in gross profit for fiscal depreciation expense used in determining gross profit for fiscal and was million  or of segment revenues  and million  or of segment revenues  respectively

our research and engineering expenses decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these costs represented approximately and of our products and systems segment revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
additionally  we adjusted the fair value of certain acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities 
for fiscal  these adjustments resulted in a net increase to income from operations of the product and systems segment of approximately million 
the fair value adjustments to acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities have been classified as acquisition related costs in the statement of operations for fiscal acquisition related costs for the fiscal acquisition activity were insignificant

our international segment contributed million to our revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of approximately and acquisition growth of approximately 
revenues from customers in the oil and gas and chemicals markets comprised approximately and of our international segment revenues during fiscal and  respectively 
other revenues were more widely distributed including infrastructure  industrial  manufacturing and other testing companies  research centers and universities 

table of contents gross profit 
our segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of segment revenues  an increase of million when compared to fiscal which was million  or of segment revenues 
the decrease in gross profit margin relates to the addition of seven acquisitions during the year as these acquisitions primarily provide lower margin  traditional ndt services 
additionally  the service offerings in our international segment are increasing faster than our product sales  which also lower our gross profit margin 
gross profit as a percent of revenues of our existing subsidiaries was for fiscal our segment gross profit for fiscal was million  or of segment revenues  an increase of million when compared to fiscal which was million  or of segment revenues 
the decrease in gross profit margin was a result of fewer overall acoustic emission product sales  which have a higher margin profile  an increase in more traditional ndt services  which carry lower margins  and an increase in reimbursable expenses  for which we receive only modest margins

foreign currency transaction gains included in income from operations were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
corporate and eliminations the elimination in revenues and cost of revenues primarily relates to the elimination in consolidation of revenues from sales of our products and systems segment to the international and services segments 
the other major item in the corporate and eliminations grouping are the general and administrative costs not allocated to the other segments 
these costs primarily include those for non segment management  accounting and auditing  acquisition transactional costs  stock compensation expense and certain other costs 
as a percentage of our total revenues  these costs have generally remained constant over the last three fiscal years  consisting of of total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses in fiscal and primarily related to higher compensation and additional staff and other general increases in expense at our corporate offices 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have funded our operations through cash provided from operations  bank borrowings  stock offerings and capital lease financing transactions 
we have used these proceeds to fund our operations  develop our technology  expand our sales and marketing efforts to new markets and acquire small companies or assets  primarily to add certified technicians and enhance our capabilities and geographic reach 
in october  we raised approximately million in net proceeds through our ipo  which we subsequently used to repay our bank borrowings under our credit facility and to increase our cash and cash equivalents 
in may  we raised approximately million in net proceeds through a secondary offering of our common stock  which we used to repay our bank borrowings and fund working capital 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our anticipated cash flows from operating activities  and our available borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs over the next months 

table of contents cash flows table the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal  and fiscal year in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of million over the prior fiscal year 
positive operating cash flow was primarily attributable to higher net income excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million offset by million of cash utilized to fund an increase in our working capital  which primarily related to an increase in our trade accounts receivable 
cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of million over the prior fiscal year 
positive operating cash flow was primarily attributable to higher net income excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million offset by million used to fund an increase in our working capital during fiscal  which primarily related to an increase in our trade accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal cash used in investing activities included the completion of eleven acquisition for an aggregate of million  net of cash acquired 
cash purchases of property  plant and equipment were million and were primarily related to equipment used by our technicians 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal cash used in investing activities included the completion of five acquisitions for cash payments aggregating million 
cash purchases of property  plant and equipment were million and included million to fund a land purchase and construction costs for a new operations and training facility in houston  texas 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal net cash provided by financing activities related primarily to net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of million and proceeds of million received from the exercise of stock options  offset by repayments of our capital lease obligations  long term debt  and other short term borrowings of million  million  million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from fiscal in may  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of share 
we sold  shares and  shares were sold by a selling stockholder 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from the secondary stock offering of approximately million  and net borrowings under our credit facility of million 
these proceeds were offset by repayments of million related to our capital lease obligations and other long term debt 
effect of exchange rate on changes in cash for fiscal  and  exchange rate changes increased decreased our cash by million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents cash balance and credit facility borrowings as of may   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and available borrowing capacity of million under our current revolving credit facility 
there were outstanding borrowings of million and a total of million of outstanding letters of credit under the existing revolving credit facility 
we finance our operations primarily through our existing cash balances  cash collected from operations  bank borrowings and capital lease financing 
we believe these sources are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
in december  we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement  with bank of america  na  as agent for the lenders and a lender  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  keybank national association and td bank  na  as lenders 
the credit agreement provides us with a million revolving line of credit  which  under certain circumstances  can be increased to million 
the credit agreement has a maturity date of december  and permits us to borrow up to million in non us dollar currencies and to use up to million of the credit limit for the issuance of letters of credit 
loans under the credit agreement bear interest at libor plus an applicable libor margin ranging from to  or a base rate margin less a margin of to  at our option  or based upon our funded debt leverage ratio 
funded debt leverage ratio is generally the ratio of all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other interest bearing indebtedness as of the date of determination to ebitda which is a net income  less b income or plus loss from discontinued operations and extraordinary items  plus c income tax expenses  plus d interest expense  plus e depreciation  depletion  and amortization including non cash loss on retirement of assets  plus f stock compensation expense  less g cash expense related to stock compensation  plus or minus certain other adjustments for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the date of determination 
we have the benefit of the lowest margin if our funded debt leverage ratio is equal to or less than to  and the margin increases as the ratio increases  to the maximum margin if the ratio is greater than to we will also bear additional costs for market disruption  regulatory changes effecting the lenders funding costs  and default pricing of an additional interest rate margin if the funded debt leverage ratio exceeds to amounts borrowed under our credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a funded debt leverage ratio of less than to and an interest coverage ratio of at least to interest coverage ratio means the ratio  as of any date of determination  of a ebitda for the month period immediately preceding the date of determination  to b all interest  premium payments  debt discount  fees  charges and related expenses of us and our subsidiaries in connection with borrowed money including capitalized interest or in connection with the deferred purchase price of assets  in each case to the extent treated as interest in accordance with gaap  paid during the month period immediately preceding the date of determination 
the credit agreement also limits our ability to  among other things  create liens  make investments  incur more indebtedness  merge or consolidate  make dispositions of property  pay dividends and make distributions to stockholders  enter into a new line of business  enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into burdensome agreements 
the credit agreement does not limit our ability to acquire other businesses or companies except that the acquired business or company must be in our line of business  we must be in compliance with the financial covenants on a pro forma basis after taking into account the acquisition  and  if the acquired business is a separate subsidiary  in certain circumstances the lenders will receive the benefit of a guaranty of the subsidiary and liens on its assets and a pledge of its stock 
as of may   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  and we will continuously monitor our compliance with the covenants contained in our new credit agreement 
liquidity and capital resources outlook future sources of cash we expect our future sources of cash to include cash flow from operations and cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility is available for cash advances required for working capital and for letters of credit to support our operations 
to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we expect primarily to rely on cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we are currently funding our acquisitions through our available cash  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and seller notes 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to approximately million of securities  including shares of common and preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and units 
accordingly  we may also seek to obtain capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination of both 
as of august   there were outstanding borrowings of approximately million and approximately million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents future uses of cash we expect our future uses of cash will primarily be for acquisitions  international expansion  purchases or manufacture of field testing equipment to support growth  additional investments in technology and software products and the replacement of existing assets and equipment used in our operations 
we often make purchases to support new sources of revenues  particularly in our services segment 
in addition  we will need to fund a certain amount of replacement equipment  including our fleet vehicles 
we historically spend approximately to of our total revenues on capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  and expect to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash and lease financing 
our cash capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for fiscal  and were approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
our future acquisitions may also require capital 
we completed eleven acquisitions in fiscal  with an initial cash outlay of million 
in some cases  additional equipment will be needed to upgrade the capabilities of these acquired companies 
in addition  our future acquisition and capital spending may increase as we pursue growth opportunities 
other investments in infrastructure  training and software may also be required to match our growth  but we plan to continue using a disciplined approach to building our business 
in addition  we will use cash to fund our operating leases  capital leases and long term debt repayments and various other obligations as they arise 
we also expect to use cash to support our working capital requirements for our operations  particularly in the event of further growth and due to the impacts of seasonality on our business 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements  public or private equity financings  or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments  in addition to those related to our long term debt discussed below  consist of obligations under facility leases for office space and equipment leases 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of may  in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations contingent consideration obligations total long term debt consists primarily of seller notes payable in connection with our acquisitions and includes the current portion outstanding 
includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the leases 
off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our more significant estimates include the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities  the impairment of long lived assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory obsolescence  and reserves for self insured workers compensation and health benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described below and in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this item of this annual report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue recognition policies for the various sources of revenues are as follows services we predominantly derive revenues by providing services on a time and material basis and recognizes revenues when services are rendered 
at the end of any reporting period  there may be earned but unbilled revenues that are accrued 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are reflected as deferred revenues 
software revenues from the sale of perpetual licenses are recognized upon the delivery and acceptance of the software 
revenues from term licenses are recognized ratably over the period of the license 
revenues from maintenance  unspecified upgrades and technical support are recognized ratably over the period such items are delivered 
for multiple element arrangement software contracts that include non software elements  and where the software is essential to the functionality of the non software elements collectively referred to as software multiple element arrangements  we apply the rules as noted below 
products revenues from product sales are recognized when risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
exceptions to this accounting treatment arise when products are sold as part of a multiple element arrangement described below or those situations where specialized installation or customer acceptance is required  in which case revenue is recognized when installation  services and or acceptance occurs 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are reflected as deferred revenues 
percentage of completion a portion of our revenues are generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from several months to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting revenues are recognized as work is performed 
the percentage of completion at any point in time is based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the percentage of completion is then applied to the total contract revenue to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in the period 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct materials  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 

table of contents multiple element arrangements we occasionally enter into transactions that may contain multiple elements of products  services  software  or percentage of completion deliverables 
under current financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  we utilize vendor specific objective evidence to determine whether the multiple elements can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered item has value on a standalone basis  and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  if the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then revenues are deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
effective june   we adopted updated guidance from the fasb that requires the allocation of revenue in multiple element arrangements to separate units of accounting based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other first party evidence is not available  see recent accounting pronouncements 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested  at least annually  for impairment at the reporting unit level 
for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing  we have identified our reporting units as our operating segments 
all of our segments have goodwill 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at may   the carrying amount of our goodwill totaled million 
as discussed further in note  we early adopted the fasb accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
for fiscal  our qualitative assessment concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any the reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount and  therefore  the two step goodwill impairment test was not required 
intangible assets are recorded at cost  with finite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization periodically to determine if any adverse condition exists or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or change in useful life 
if impairment exists  and it is determined that there is no partial recoverability  an impairment charge is recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flow analysis or a comparison to fair values of similar assets 
we had million and million in net property  plant and equipment as of may  and  respectively  and did not record any impairment charges in the two fiscal years ended on those dates 
long lived assets  net outside of the us totaled million and million as of may  and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
this process requires that we assess temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets resulting from differing treatment between book and tax of certain items  such as depreciation 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
as of may  and  we had net deferred income tax benefit of 
table of contents million and net deferred income tax expense of million  respectively 
with the exception of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets 
we currently do not believe there are other outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur with regard to income taxes that would have a material impact on our fiscal and financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which requires companies to allocate the overall consideration in multiple element arrangements to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price 
effective june   we adopted  on a prospective basis  the provisions of this updated accounting standard related to revenue recognition associated with contractual arrangements involving multiple elements 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
asu provides guidance on applying the milestone method to milestone payments for achieving specified performance measure when those payments are related to uncertain future events limited to transactions involving research and development 
entities can make an accounting policy election to recognize arrangement consideration received for achieving specified performance measures during the period in which the milestones are achieved  provided certain criteria are met 
effective june   we adopted  on a prospective basis  the provisions of this updated accounting standard related to milestones 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  or our option to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects  nor does it affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
asu requires retrospective application  and it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is then necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt this guidance in fiscal the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at may  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in bank deposits  money market funds and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure  particularly the euro  british pound sterling  brazilian real  russian ruble  japanese yen  canadian dollar and the indian rupee  arises primarily 
table of contents from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in british pound sterling and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
an unfavorable change in the average us dollar exchange rates for fiscal would cause a change in consolidated operating income of approximately million and a favorable change would cause a change of approximately million 
we may consider entering into hedging or forward exchange contracts in the future 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices
