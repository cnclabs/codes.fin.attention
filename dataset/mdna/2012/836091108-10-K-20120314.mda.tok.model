risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we provide cloud based  multi channel services that enable businesses to design  execute and measure customer communication campaigns for a variety of marketing  customer care  payment and collection processes

our services are provided using a multi tenant  cloud based architecture that enables us to serve all of our clients cost effectively 
cloud based refers to the delivery of technology services through the internet  which includes delivery of software as a service or saas 
because our services are cloud based  businesses using our services do not need to invest in or maintain new hardware or to hire and manage additional dedicated information technology staff 
in addition  we are able to implement new features on our platforms that become part of our services automatically and can benefit all clients immediately 
our secure platforms are designed to serve increasing numbers of clients and growing demand from existing clients  enabling the platforms to scale reliably and cost effectively 
we serve two global markets hosted contact centers and mobile marketing 
our hosted contact center services are used primarily by companies in the accounts receivable management or collections  energy and utilities  financial services  retail  and telecommunications and media industries 
our mobile marketing client base consists principally of companies in the consumer package goods  retail  and telecommunications and media industries 
in our services were used by more than businesses located in the united states and europe 
we use our direct sales channel principally to target large business to consumer companies  and we leverage our partnership channel to offer our services more broadly within our target markets  to enter new vertical markets  to augment our international expansion and to sell to smaller businesses cost effectively 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future  a substantial majority of our revenues from the hosted contact center market 
our strategy for achieving long term  sustained growth in our revenues and net income is focused on building upon our leadership position in the hosted contact center market and executing on our key initiatives 
for example  one of our strategic initiatives is targeted on the high growth area of mobile marketing  which leverages our text capabilities 
in line with this strategy  in june we acquired 
table of contents key assets and assumed certain liabilities of smartreply  a mobile marketing company located in irvine  california 
additionally  in february  we acquired ergo americas  the us operations of ergo group plc  a mobile business and marketing solutions company located in arlington  virginia 
key components of results of operations revenues we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues by providing our services for use by clients in communicating with their customers through voice  text and email messages 
we provide our services under a combination of usage and subscription based models 
under our usage based model  prices are calculated on a per message or per minute basis in accordance with the terms of pricing agreements with clients 
we primarily invoice our clients on a monthly basis 
our pricing agreements with a substantial majority of our clients either do not require any minimum usage or payments  or require only an immaterial level of usage or payments 
each executed message represents a transaction from which we derive revenues  and we therefore recognize revenue based on actual usage within a calendar month 
we do not recognize revenue until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and we deem collection to be probable 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consist primarily of telephony and text message charges  compensation expense for our operations personnel  depreciation and maintenance expense for our platforms and lease costs for our data center facilities 
as we continue to grow our business and add features to our platforms  we expect cost of revenues will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis 
our annual gross margin was in  in and in we currently are targeting a gross margin of to for the foreseeable future 
our gross margin may vary significantly from our target range for a number of reasons  including revenue levels  the mix of types of messaging campaigns executed  as well as the extent to which we build our infrastructure through  for example  significant acquisitions of hardware or material increases in leased data center facilities 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses and depreciation expense of certain equipment related to the development of our services 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving and enhancing our platforms  as well as developing new features and offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  including sales commissions  as well as the costs of our marketing programs 
we expect to further invest in developing our marketing strategy and activities to extend brand awareness and generate additional leads for our sales staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses for executive  finance  accounting  administrative and management information systems personnel  accounting and legal professional fees and other corporate expenses 
recent developments cost saving activities 
in may  we eliminated two research and development positions  five sales and marketing positions  and one general and administrative position in order to lower our cost of operations 
in addition to these reductions  we also reduced the use of external contracting resources 
these actions resulted in cost savings of approximately  in 
table of contents smartreply asset acquisition 
as a result of our acquisition of key assets of smartreply in june  we incurred an additional million in operating expenses in  excluding costs related to the purchase price 
the additional operating expenses incurred during included  of amortization expense related to the acquisition of intangible assets  primarily customer lists 
we estimate this expense will be  for and  for ergo americas acquisition 
in february  we acquired ergo americas  the us operations of ergo group plc  for a cash purchase price of million subject to post closing adjustment 
ergo americas is a mobile business and marketing solutions company located in arlington  virginia and has a current annualized revenue run rate of approximately million 
additional key measures of financial performance we present information below with respect to cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
free cash flow is a measure of financial performance calculated as cash flow from operating activities plus proceeds from the sale of equipment  less payments of contingent purchase price  investments in capitalized software and purchases of property and equipment 
management uses these metrics to track business performance 
due to the current economic environment  management decisions are based in part  on a goal of maintaining positive cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
we believe these metrics are useful measures of the performance of our business because  in contrast to statement of operations metrics that rely principally on revenue and profitability  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow capture the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year and the effect of noncash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation 
we believe that  for similar reasons  these metrics are often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of saas and other software companies 
the term free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
all or a portion of free cash flow may be unavailable for discretionary expenditures 
free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance  you should not consider free cash flow in isolation from or as a substitute for data  such as net income loss  derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
as of december  in thousands cash flows used in generated from operating activities proceeds from sale of equipment contingent purchase price payments to mobile collect investments in capitalized software purchases of property and equipment free cash flow non gaap our operating activities used net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million  which was offset in part by non cash charges and changes in working capital of  those charges and changes consisted primarily of a depreciation and amortization expense of million and b stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by c an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  d an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of million  and e a deferred income tax benefit of  the increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable was due to the timing of payments  and the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses reflected the timing of receipts from our clients  as well as advance payments of certain operating costs 

table of contents our operating activities generated net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million  which was offset by non cash charges and changes in working capital of million consisting primarily of a depreciation expense of million  b stock based compensation expense of million  and c a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  due to the timing of receipts from our clients and the advance payments of certain operating costs 
our operating activities used net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  mainly due to the timing of receipts from our clients 
these changes were partially offset by non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  as well as an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
free cash flow in each of the years presented reflects  in addition to the factors driving cash flow from operating activities  our purchases of property and equipment  which consists primarily of computer equipment and software  investments in capitalized software  proceeds from the sale of our equipment and our payments of contingent purchase price in connection with our acquisition of the assets of mobile collect in critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
a critical accounting policy is one that both is material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill we have recognized goodwill from our february acquisition of the assets of mobile collect  in which a significant portion of the consideration was contingent on the future revenues of the acquired assets 
because of the accounting rules in effect at the time of the acquisition and the uncertainties with respect to future revenues  the contingent consideration was recognized as additional purchase price as the consideration was determined and became payable 
we expect the final payment for this asset acquisition  approximating  will come due in as of december   we have recognized million of goodwill from this acquisition 
in addition  we have recognized million of goodwill from our june acquisition of key assets of smart reply 
recorded goodwill at december  totaled million 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for impairment and have selected november as the annual impairment testing date 
we operate as a single operating segment and have concluded that our company is comprised of one reporting unit 
as a result of the economic environment impacting our business and operating results coupled with a material decline of our stock price  we determined impairment triggering events had occurred that required interim impairment evaluations  which resulted in impairment charges totaling  for the year ended december  
table of contents at november   the last impairment testing date  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a market approach  which utilized our market capitalization as a basis for estimating fair value and we applied a control premium of 
our fair market value exceeded our carrying value by approximately at november   our most recent annual impairment assessment date 
as such  no indications of impairment were noted 
our stock price is volatile  however  and future changes in the quoted price of our stock or in other judgments that underlie the fair value estimates  including an estimated control premium  may indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying value  which may result in future impairment charges 
valuation of contingent consideration for the june smart reply asset acquisition  we recorded contingent consideration at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we remeasure the fair value of this obligation and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and passage of time  as well as updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any performance targets 
these fair value measurements represent level measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy  including level  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
as a result of the june acquisition of smartreply assets  we recognized a liability totaling million  representing the present value of the probability weighted estimate of the future payments that arose from a contingent consideration arrangement in the form of an earn out 
the earn out requires cash payments that we estimated will be million  but the arrangement provides for up to a maximum of million  which may become payable annually over three years based upon year over year revenue growth from the acquired mobile marketing business and enhancements to our select legacy customer revenues 
as actual mobile marketing revenues are recognized  the liability for the contingent consideration will periodically be adjusted to reflect our best estimate of the ultimate payout under this arrangement 
the adjustments to the fair value from the acquisition date to december  were not material 
income taxes we are subject to federal and various state income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our provision for these income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to canadian and uk taxes for profits generated from our wholly owned subsidiaries 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
at december   our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of federal net operating loss carryforwards and state research and development credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  due to the current uncertainty related to when  if ever  these assets will be realized 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period in which such a determination is made 
in  we recorded deferred tax liabilities of  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired with smartreply  and released a corresponding amount of deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the  release of the valuation allowance was recognized as a benefit for income taxes during the year ending december

because of our history of losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock  borrowings under credit facilities and  more recently  cash flow from operations 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  our projected cash flow from operating activities  and our borrowings available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rates of our revenue growth  our introduction of new features for our multi 
table of contents channel services  and our expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products 
if additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or to effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
credit facility borrowings in february we renewed a credit facility with silicon valley bank that provides a working capital line of credit at an interest rate of per annum for up to the lesser of a million or b of eligible accounts receivable  subject to specified adjustments 
accounts receivable serve as collateral for any borrowings under the credit facility 
there are certain financial covenant requirements as part of the facility  including an adjusted quick ratio and certain minimum quarterly revenue requirements  none of which are restrictive to our overall operations 
the credit facility will expire by its terms on february  and any amounts outstanding must be repaid on that date 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the existing credit agreement and letters of credit totaling  had been issued in connection with our facility leases 
operating cash flow for a discussion of our cash flow from operating activities  please see additional key elements of financial performance 
working capital the following table sets forth selected working capital information as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts working capital our cash and cash equivalents at december  were unrestricted and held for working capital purposes 
they were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our short term investments are comprised of commercial paper  certificate of deposits and us government agency bonds 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
fluctuations vary depending on cash collections  client mix and the volume of monthly usage of our services 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on an annual basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by revenues for the most recent year  multiplied by b the number of days in the year 
our dso was days at december   days at december  and days at december  the increase in dso at december  was primarily due to a delay in certain large customer payments until january 
table of contents requirements capital expenditures in recent years  we have made capital expenditures primarily to acquire computer hardware and software and  to a lesser extent  furniture and leasehold improvements  to support the growth of our business 
our capital expenditures approximated  in  million in and  in internally capitalized software totaled  in we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure our continued ability to enhance our platforms  introduce new features and maintain the reliability of our network 
we also intend to make investments in computer equipment and systems  as well as fixed assets as we continue to grow our business and add additional personnel 
we expect our capital expenditures for these purposes will approximate million in we are not currently party to any purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and requirements the following table sets forth our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  less than year to years to years more than years total in thousands operating leases office space operating leases hosting facilities total our operating leases include a lease for our headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
a majority of our leases related to hosting facilities are cancelable upon sixty days notice 
acquisition in february  we acquired ergo americas for a cash purchase price of million 
see also note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
contingent payments in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of mobile collect  a privately held company that provided text messaging and mobile communications solutions 
the acquisition price included cash payments of  upon closing and requires contingent cash payments of up to million payable quarterly through in the event that certain established financial targets are satisfied through the operation of the acquired assets 
as of december    of contingent cash payments were payable to the stockholders of mobile collect 
we expect the balance of contingent cash payments  approximating  will become payable in in june  we acquired key assets and assumed certain liabilities of smartreply  a mobile marketing company located in irvine  california 
the acquisition price included cash payments of million upon closing and requires contingent cash payments estimated at million  but up to a maximum of million  in the form of an earn out  which may be payable annually over three years based upon year over year revenue growth in our mobile marketing business 

table of contents stock repurchase program in march  we announced that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
we will determine the timing and amount of any shares repurchased based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
repurchases may be made under a rule b plan  which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of  under the program 
for additional information  see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
effects of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
however  the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  cost of revenues and operating expenses  primarily employee compensation costs  may not be readily recoverable in the pricing of our services 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k of the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
at december   we also had short term investments of million  consisting primarily of commercial paper  certificate of deposits and us government agency bonds  which were all classified as available for sale 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates and a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income
