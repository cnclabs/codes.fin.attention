overview of the company and recent developments meade instruments corp 
is engaged in the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of consumer products  primarily telescopes  telescope accessories and sport optics products such as binoculars and spotting scopes 
we design our products in house or with the assistance of external consultants 
most of our products are manufactured overseas by contract manufacturers in asia  while our high end telescopes are manufactured and assembled in our mexico facilities 
sales of our products are driven by an in house sales force as well as a network of sales representatives throughout the us and through international distributors worldwide 
we currently operate out of two primary locations irvine  california and tijuana  mexico 
our california facility serves as the company s corporate headquarters and served as our us distribution facility through february  at which time we eliminated the us positions associated with our us distribution activities in order to reduce the company s costs in reaction to the decline in sales of the company s low end telescopes and other imported products 
the distribution of the company s products  including imported products  is now managed at our mexico facility which contains our manufacturing  assembly  repair  packaging  research and development  distribution and other general and administrative operations 
our business is highly seasonal and our financial results have historically varied significantly on a quarter by quarter basis throughout each year 

table of contents we believe that the company holds valuable brand names and intellectual property that provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
the meade brand name is ubiquitous in the consumer telescope market  while the coronado brand name represents a unique niche in the area of solar astronomy 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to assist users in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with asc no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  typically at the time of shipment  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment if these criteria are not met 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts product returns or offers markdown incentives 
material management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing sales returns and allowances estimates 
the company continuously monitors and tracks returns and allowances and records revenues net of provisions for returns and allowances 
the company s estimate of sales returns and allowances is based upon several factors including historical experience  current market and economic conditions  customer demand and acceptance of the company s products and or any notification received by the company of such a return 
historically  sales returns and allowances have been within management s estimates  however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from management s estimates depending on actual market conditions at the time of the return 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory may be written down based on such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
acquisition related intangible assets the company accounts for acquisition related intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 business combinations  and asc no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
a portion of the remaining difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net tangible assets at the date of acquisition is included in the balance sheet as acquisition related intangible assets 
amortization periods for the intangible assets subject to amortization range from seven to fifteen years depending on the nature of the assets acquired 
the carrying value of acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  is evaluated in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  which is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows based upon our estimated cost of capital  an impairment loss is reflected in loss from operations 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes  the company determined that there was sufficient uncertainty surrounding the future realization of its deferred tax assets to warrant the recording of a full valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was recorded based upon the company s determination that there was insufficient objective evidence  at the time  to recognize those assets for financial reporting purposes 
for the fiscal year ended february   the company has not changed its assessment regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
ultimate realization of the benefit of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  including periods prior to the expiration of certain underlying tax credits 

table of contents as of february  and as of february   the company has no unrecognized tax benefits 
management does not anticipate that there will be a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
at february   there were no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes consists of minimum tax in various us states and income taxes on the company s operations in mexico 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
however  the amount of a net operating loss carryforward can be adjusted for federal tax purposes for the three years four years for the major state jurisdictions in which the company operates after the net operating loss is utilized 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development loss from operations interest income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss the following table summarizes our net sales by product category in millions years ended february  february  telescopes related products weather stations timing products sport optics other net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported net sales of million during the fiscal year ended february   a decrease of million or from net sales of million during the fiscal year ended february  approximately million or of this decrease in net sales was due to a decrease in net sales of the company s imported low end telescope products to mass retail customers 
this decrease of sales of low end telescopes to mass retail customers was partially offset by sales of sport optics products to such customers 
sales of sport optics products to mass retail customers increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
sales of nearly all of the company s other products were down 
declines in the company s high end and intermediate telescope and related products were attributed 
table of contents to increased competition  effects on consumer discretionary spending associated with the general economic conditions and a decrease in order fulfillment attributed primarily to the announcement of the company s new lx and lx products in fall the company received approximately million in orders for these products during the fourth quarter of fiscal but the company was not able to begin shipping these products until after the end of fiscal the lx began shipping in april and the lx is expected to ship soon after that 
approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended february  were from one customer 
no such concentration existed during the fiscal year ended february  the primary reason for the decline in sales to these customers was a decrease in sales of lower end telescope products which the company imported from suppliers located in china 
the gross profit margin during fiscal increased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in fiscal this improvement in the gross profit margin was driven primarily by a favorable change in product mix as the company sold less low end telescopes and imported products which typically earn a lower margin and are characterized by substantial returns by consumers who purchase those products at mass retail stores which have liberal return policies 
consumers who purchase the company s high end and intermediate telescopes and related accessories are most often knowledgeable about the product and are less likely to purchase the products impulsively and return the product to the retail store 
selling expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal this decrease was attributable to reduced net sales  offset partially by increases in discretionary spending such as advertising expenses attributable to new product introductions and related promotions 
in order to address the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales  the company eliminated approximately positions relating to its us sales and distribution operations in january due to the decline in sales of the company s low end telescopes and imported products 
these reductions are expected to save the company approximately million annually 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million of net sales  a decrease of million or compared to million of net sales in fiscal approximately million or of the decrease was due to lower stock compensation expense 
approximately million or was attributable to further reductions in headcount 
the remainder of the decrease was comprised of reductions in property and use taxes due to a reduction in the company s property and equipment located in orange county  california  and lower insurance  legal fees  and other expenses as part of the company s continued efforts to minimize its costs 
research and development expenses increased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company has been in the process of developing several new products which are intended to capitalize on the company s competitive advantages and to broaden the company s product line into areas of the market which the company has been absent in for several years such as german equatorial mounted telescopes 
the lx and lx telescopes were announced in fall and the lx is in the process of being announced 
additional product development projects are planned to be completed in fiscal the company earned interest income in fiscal and  due to the continued cash balance the company maintains 
the reduction in interest income from thousand in fiscal to thousand in fiscal was due to lower rates and average carrying balances 
liquidity and capital resources fluctuations in cash working capital the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at february   a decrease of million or compared to million at february  despite no change in the net loss ie  a net loss of million in both years 
approximately million or of the decrease in cash was due to an increase in cash used by operating activities due to net unfavorable fluctuations in working capital  such as increases in inventories and reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in fiscal  inventories increased by approximately million primarily due to the fact that the company s new lx and lx products were awaiting final development changes prior to their being approved for shipment 
in addition  accounts receivable decreased approximately million compared to the prior year because of a decrease in net sales in the fourth quarter  not because of an improvement in the company s cash conversion cycle 
the net increase in working capital in fiscal compared to the prior year resulted in an increase in cash used by operations of million in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  the company increased cash provided by operating activities by million as a result of a reduction in working capital achieved by reducing its inventory as part of a concentrated effort to reduce inventory and reducing its sales backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining million or of the decrease in cash was due to the fact that the loss in fiscal was comprised of less non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation compared to fiscal access to credit the company currently has in place an undrawn million secured credit facility with first capital 
the original term of the agreement expired in january  at which time the prepayment penalty provision expired but the expiration of the initial term did not materially affect the lender s ability to restrict  reduce or eliminate the company s access to credit 
the company continues to assign its invoices to first capital 
availability of funds under this facility is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory located in the us availability on this facility amounted to over million as of february  approximately of accounts receivable 
while the company s credit facility does not contain explicit financial covenants  the company s lender has significant latitude in restricting  reducing or withdrawing the company s credit facility at its sole discretion with limited notice  as is customary with these types of arrangements 
the company is currently working to reduce its credit facility in order to minimize the costs of the credit facility and right size the facility according to the company s needs 
the company currently anticipates that cash on hand and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements for fiscal in the event the company requires more capital than is presently anticipated due to unforeseen factors  the company may need to rely on its credit facility 
in such an instance  if its lender restricts  reduces or eliminates the company s access to credit  or requires immediate repayment of the amounts outstanding under the agreement  the company would be required to pursue additional or alternative sources of liquidity such as equity financings or a new debt agreement with other creditors  either of which may contain less favorable terms 
the company cannot assure that such additional sources of capital would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
cost reductions in february  the company eliminated all us positions relating to its us distribution operations as well as certain sales positions relating to its low end telescope sales 
this headcount reduction is expected to save the company approximately million per year 
as part of this restructuring  the company relocated its us inventory to its mexico facility and is working with a real estate broker to sublease its us warehouse  which is approximately  square feet of the company s  square foot facility in irvine  california 
the company estimates that it could save an additional million per year if it successfully subleases its us warehouse 
in addition  the company pays approximately million annually for its current corporate office and warehouse located in irvine  california  the lease expires in february according to discussions with the company s real estate broker  current market value for office space that is deemed sufficient for the remaining usoperations would be approximately million annually  which would constitute savings of million per year 
as a result  the company is exploring a sublease of all or a portion of its irvine operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find a sublessee in order to realize the potential savings 
the movement of inventory out of the us  as part of the restructuring of the company s distribution operations  will reduce the company s ability to borrow on that inventory 
however  the company has not advanced on its credit facility against its inventory since inception of its initial agreement with first capital in january and does not anticipate needing to borrow against its inventory in the future 
in addition  eliminating the inventory component of the credit facility will reduce the costs of the company s credit facility 
the company is currently negotiating for a reduced credit facility  which will likely be reduced from million to million as the company s net sales could not generate a borrowing base of million nor would the company need to advance such a large amount for short term working capital needs 
the company paid approximately million of fees associated with its credit facility in fiscal if the company is able to replace its current credit facility  the company believes it could achieve potential savings of million 

table of contents the following table summarizes the effected and potential cost reductions outlined above cost reductions effected potential in millions headcount reductions in us sales and distribution sublease of us warehouse sublease of us office  net of rent on new office reduction of credit facility size and scope capital expenditures  including financed purchases of equipment  aggregated million for each of the years ended february  and february  the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at february  inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past two years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal and beyond
