table of contents item a 
risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward looking information 
however  our actual results may differ materially from our expectations  statements or projections 
the following risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from our expectations  statements or projections 
general factors the ongoing instability in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing global financial crisis may limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions 
accordingly  if the global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments 
despite our recent gain on our sale of coalogix  we have a history of operating losses  and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years 
in  and  we had operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we continue to pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities and may need to support the financing needs of our subsidiaries 
following the sale of coalogix  we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may need additional funds to finance future investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake 
we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may have to limit or adjust our investment acquisition strategy in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 
in october  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which acorn would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock 
the source of our current dividends are the proceeds from our recent sale of coalogix 
we intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of acorn applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
future dividends may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions or our subsidiaries  use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions  stock repurchase programs  the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable acorn to continue to pay dividends  changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws  and changes to our business model 
our dividend payments may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all 
a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

table of contents we depend on key management for the success of our business 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of john a 
moore  our ceo  benny sela  ceo of dsit  lindon shiao  ceo of gridsense and jim andersen  ceo of ussi and other key management level employees 
the loss of the services of any of these key employees could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees other than for our ceo  john a 
moore 
although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them  members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods 
we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations 
we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel 
the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers 
the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules 
the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers 
although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non competition agreements  the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  our business could be disrupted 
we have recently hired an individual who is our senior director of external relations to assist in certain legislative and other governmental relations matters such activities may be deemed to be lobbying efforts 
to the extent that our senior director of external relations engages in activities that constitute lobbying under federal  state  or local laws  we have to register him and possibly ourselves and one or more of our subsidiaries under such applicable laws 
lobbying laws typically require periodic financial and other reports to be timely made and any failure to register or to comply with the applicable regulations could subject us  our employees and officers and directors to civil or criminal penalties 
we intend to comply with such laws 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock or the common stock of our subsidiaries 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act  dodd frank act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
part of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies omnimetrix in february see recent developments  ussi in february and gridsense in may or complimentary companies for our subsidiaries 
any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition s management into our controls  systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our strategy is to continue to integrate our newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences 
integrating acquired 
table of contents companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business  including failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies  dilution of existing stockholders  potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies  sales and marketing  and research and development efforts  and the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including accounting controls and procedures 
if any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the same could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
in order to grow  one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions 
any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act of  dodd frank act and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities 
we expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations  we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs 
we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
we may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting principles  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed if certain conditions exist 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment of goodwill associated with our former coreworx subsidiary following our decision to stop funding it and an impairment of million associated with our gridsense segment 
any additional impairment of the value of goodwill will result in an additional charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 

table of contents our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful  others may duplicate our technology 
our operating companies rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  systems designs and manufacturing processes 
the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or  in the case of patents issued  that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes 
further  a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas 
even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad  they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours 
we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products  systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends 
we rely  to a significant degree  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these trade secrets cannot be protected by patent protection 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful 
we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology related industries and we believe that the industries that certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity 
third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop  manufacture or provide our current and future products  systems or services infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights 
we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products  systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others 
the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology  products  systems and services 
in addition  the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty 
litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty 
table of contents of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits  escrowed funds  restricted deposits and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a significant amount of our cash equivalents is a money market of a major financial institution 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
the counterparty to our restricted deposits are two major israeli banks 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
short term deposits are in fdic insured certificates of deposit through the certificate of deposit account registry service 
the company does not believe there is significant risk of non performance by the counterparties 
the counterparty to our escrowed funds is a major financial institution 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from two customers that pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
approximately of the balance in unbilled revenue at december  was due from two customers that when billed  pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of unbilled revenue is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
results from our past successful sales of subsidiary companies may not be repeated in the past  we have sold certain former subsidiaries comverge and coalogix at a profit  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repeat these successes with one or more of our current subsidiaries 
we invest in companies before they have a meaningful history of revenues and whether we can operate these entities successfully or realize any profit on our investments in them cannot be determined 
risks related to dsit solutions failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce dsit s margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  dsit undertakes to deliver software or integrated hardware software solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by dsit s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  dsit s costs are substantially higher than expected  it may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli high tech market and may harm dsit s operations 
dsit s operations are conducted in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit 
any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi tech market  which may result in a deterioration of the results dsit s operations 
in addition  an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to dsit s operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to its offices or those of its customers or harm to its personnel 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of dsit s operations 
a majority of dsit s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u 
s dollars or are in new israeli shekels nis linked to the us dollar 
at the same time  most of dsit s expenses are denominated in nis primarily labor costs and are not linked to any foreign currency 
the net effect of a devaluation of the us dollar relative to the nis is that dsit s costs in dollar terms increases more than its revenues 
dsit enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations  however  we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully 
in the us dollar strengthened in relation to the nis by 

table of contents dsit is substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline 
in  approximately of dsit s revenues were concentrated in four customers 
these customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit s revenues and cash flow for a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit 
dsit is dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for its operations 
dsit s operations place a great reliance on it meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance its operations 
should dsit encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones  resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
dsit must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects 
these guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits 
some of the projects dsit performs require significant performance and or bank guarantees 
at december   dsit had million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding 
in addition  dsit had on deposit at two israeli banks approximately million collateralizing some of these guarantees 
these deposits are restricted and  accordingly  dsit cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released 
at times  this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  dsit may not always be able to supply such guarantees or restricted deposits without financial assistance from acorn 
if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit  acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to it in a timely manner 
if dsit is unable to keep pace with rapid technological change  its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
some of dsit s solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence 
dsit s competitiveness and future success depends on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position 
a failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay dsit s development of new products  which could result in technological obsolescence  decreased revenues  and or a loss of market share to competitors 
to the extent that dsit fails to keep pace with technological change  its revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dsit is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with components for some of its products 
a number of dsit s suppliers provide it with major components for some of its products for the energy security sonar solutions segment 
some of these components are long lead items 
if for some reason  the suppliers cannot provide dsit with the component when it is needed and dsit cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms  dsit may have increased costs and or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence 
in addition  project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while dsit is constantly attempting to develop secondary and tertiary suppliers for these components  it can provide no assurance that it will be successful in doing so on acceptable terms 
dsit is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of dsit s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with dsit s existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 

table of contents risks related to gridsense gridsense has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
gridsense incurred net losses for the years ended december   and we believe that gridsense will reduce its losses in  however  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
gridsense will need additional financing to grow and finance its operations we expect that gridsense will continue to require working capital support in order to finance its operations in as it continues to grow its production  engineering and technical support team in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
in addition to support from acorn  gridsense is in the process of negotiating a line of credit facility from a commercial bank 
management believes that establishment of a bank facility is achievable during we have no assurance the gridsense will be successful in establishing a bank facility in or beyond 
gridsense s products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of gridsense 
the primary market for gridsense s products and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain 
if the markets for gridsense s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition  its business will suffer 
as a result  gridsense may be unable to i successfully market its current products and services  ii develop new products  services and enhancements to current products and services  iii complete customer installations on a timely basis or iv complete products and services currently under development 
if gridsense s products and services are not accepted by its customers or by other businesses in the marketplace  gridsense s business and operating results will be materially affected 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives 
gridsense s products are subject to regulatory approvals 
numerous regulations govern the manufacture and sale of gridsense s products in the united states and other countries where gridsense intends to market its products 
such regulation bears upon the approval of manufacturing techniques  testing procedures and approval for the manufacturing and sale of gridsense s products  including advertising and labeling 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to market our products 
furthermore  product approvals may be withdrawn if problems occur following initial marketing or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained 
the failure  delay or withdrawal of a previously given regulatory approval could materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial position 
sales to utilities are generally characterized by long sales cycles 
gridsense s sales are largely dependent on the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support 
the purchasing cycle for a utility may involve an evaluation trial or pilot  analysis of data and results  review of competitor s offerings and smaller scale deployments  before a purchasing decision is made 
for large orders  some utilities are required to solicit competitive bids from other vendors which can contribute more time 
the entire process can take anywhere between several weeks to several quarters 
delays in securing purchase orders can materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial condition 
gridsense is attempting to broaden its revenue base by expanding into the north american market 
gridsense is currently recording a significant portion of its revenue from sales generated in australia more than in and more than for the calendar year 
gridsense believes that its continued growth and profitability will require additional expansion of sales in other markets  most notably the north american market 
to the extent that gridsense is unable to expand sales into other markets in a timely and cost effective manner  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  even with the successful recruitment of additional personnel and international 
table of contents resellers  there can be no assurance that gridsense will be successful in maintaining or increasing international market demand for its products 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of gridsense s australian operations 
gridsense has operations in both the us and australia 
its australian operations are subject to the volatility of the australian dollar vis vis the us dollar in the australian dollar was virtually unchanged vis a vis the us dollar while in  the australian dollar strengthened by 
while risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that gridsense s australian operation s sales and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars  currency fluctuations may impact the translation of certain balance sheet items  affect the economics of manufacturing and ultimately affect its financial performance 
gridsense does not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
gridsense s market is subject to rapidly changing technologies 
gridsense markets its products in a field where electronics and software firmware dominate 
this fast changing area may generate unknown methods of detecting and monitoring disturbances that could render gridsense s technology inferior  resulting in gridsense s results of operations being materially adversely affected 
gridsense does  however  closely monitor trends and changes in technologies and customer demand that could adversely impact its competitiveness and overall success 
gridsense is subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
some of gridsense s competitors in the markets it serves are larger  better capitalized and have greater resources than gridsense 
as gridsense grows and penetrates markets where larger companies have been established  it may experience a reduced rate of growth due to competitive forces 
competition from these competitors may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
risks related to ussi ussi has a limited operating history 
ussi was formed in november and has a limited operating history 
many of its products are at a research and development stage and substantial time  effort and financial resources will be required before it can become profitable 
ussi s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  especially one that is dependent on developing new products for the oil gas and security industries 
the likelihood of ussi s success should be considered in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business such as uncertainty in product development  uncertainty in market acceptance of its products  competition  and changes in business strategy 
ussi has no assurance that it will be successful in its business activities 
ussi has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
since its inception  ussi has had annual operating losses 
ussi expects to continue to have operating losses for the year ending december  and possibly beyond as a result of increases in operating expenses required to commence manufacturing and production and to expand its sales and marketing operations 
ussi can provide no assurance that it will ultimately generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable  to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
ussi will need additional financing to grow its business and finance its operations in the period since acorn s initial investment in november through may  it has invested million directly in ussi 
during the period from may through january  acorn advanced million in contemplation of a new investment agreement that was signed in february see recent developments 
we have no assurance that ussi s future capital needs will not exceed these amounts or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow in the future to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources 
ussi may need to raise additional funds if revenues fail to meet projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand  respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the direct issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to third parties  acorn s percentage ownership of ussi may be reduced 
in addition  should additional funds be needed  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on 
table of contents terms acceptable to ussi 
if funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  ussi may not be able to fund its growth  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  this could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is a small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of ussi s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than does ussi 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with ussi s existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than can ussi to its products  which would allow them to respond more quickly than ussi to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
if ussi is unable to keep pace with technological change  ussi s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
many of ussi s products are in the research and development stage 
in addition  some of ussi s existing products may require additional engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs 
there can be no assurance that ussi will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is not yet ready to manufacture its products in commercial quantities 
in order to be successful  ussi s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost and must meet the specifications required by the customers regarding quality 
we believe that ussi s space and manufacturing capabilities at its current facilities in chatsworth  california to be sufficient to handle a large increase in sales for the future 
ussi has begun to increase its production staff and has purchased or is planning purchases of automation  control and tracking systems necessary to support larger scale production  but such systems have either not yet been purchased or if acquired  are not yet fully operational 
in addition to adding internal staffing and resources  ussi may consider potential opportunities to acquire third party manufacturing capacity through acquisition or contract manufacturing arrangements  and whether or when any will exist on terms acceptable to ussi cannot be determined 
whether such systems and the personnel with the skills to effectively operate them can be put in place to meet customer orders on a timely and high quality basis can also not be determined 
failure to do so could result in delays or failures in meeting customer demand  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and orders 
such difficulties could materially and adversely affect the business  results of operations and financial condition of ussi 
ussi is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with key components for some of its products 
ussi s products incorporate state of the art technologies 
as such  in many cases there are limited supplies of key components 
in particular  ussi currently relies on a single source for the development of its high end interrogators for some of its technologically advanced product offerings 
ussi has not yet found a second source supplier that is economically feasible to use at this time 
while ussi continues to try to mitigate the risks associated with this key component  any production delays by this supplier or any adverse change to its financial condition could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi s targeted customers may be reluctant to try its alternative solution despite its increased reliability and lower cost 
potential customers may elect to continue to use the existing expensive and less reliable technologies given their familiarity of the existing products in the market 
the competition in ussi s markets may have superior resources and marketing ability which could lead to potential customers selecting existing products over ussi s products 
while ussi continues to develop its products and invest in marketing efforts accordingly  there is no assurance that ussi s products will be preferred in the market place relative to the competition with superior overall resources 
if the market place does not adopt ussi s products as anticipated  ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce ussi s margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  ussi undertakes to deliver solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by ussi s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for 
table of contents any reason  ussi s costs are substantially higher than expected  ussi may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
ussi may lose sales if it is unable to obtain government authorization to export its products 
the export of some of ussi s products may be subject to export controls imposed by the us government and administered by the us departments of state and commerce 
in certain instances  these regulations may require pre shipment authorization from the administering department 
for products subject to the export administration regulations ear administered by the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product  the final destination and the identity of the end user 
all ussi products that are exported are subject to ear  however  most of ussi s equipment is considered ear ear items generally consist of low technology consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations 
however  if ussi were to attempt to export an ear item to an embargoed country  to an end user of concern as defined by the us department of commerce or in support of a prohibited end use as defined by the us department of commerce  ussi would be required to obtain a license 
exports of certain ussi products may also be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations itar regulations administered by the department of state s directorate of defense trade controls and may require a license 
obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time consuming 
failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect ussi s business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with us government regulations may also subject ussi to additional fees and costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect ussi s competitive position 
limited protection of proprietary technology  risks of infringement ussi s success is heavily dependent upon its internally developed technology 
ussi has filed patents covering the specific use and novel inventions developed internally 
to further protect its proprietary rights  ussi relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of its confidentiality procedures  ussi enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees  as well as select consultants and strategic partners and limit access to and distribution of its designs and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  ussi may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights 
in addition  the expense associated with the enforcement of ussi s proprietary rights may be substantial 
risks related to our securities our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
during  our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  changes in our dividend policy  changes in accounting rules  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options

the acquisition of omnimetrix adds to the company s growing product lines of remote monitoring systems for aging energy infrastructure 
acorn investment in ussi on february   we entered into a new stock purchase agreement the ussi purchase agreement with ussi pursuant to which we converted certain advanced funds million into additional shares of ussi common stock ussi common stock and shares of ussi s new series a preferred stock ussi preferred stock 
we also made a further payment to ussi of million on february  to purchase additional shares of ussi preferred stock  and we anticipate that we will purchase more shares of ussi preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million at a future date 
the ussi preferred stock provides that upon any future liquidation of ussi  to the extent funds are available for distribution to ussi s stockholders after the satisfaction of any ussi liabilities at that time  ussi would first repay us for the purchase price of our ussi preferred stock

table of contents overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we operate in three reportable segments energy security sonar solutions through our dsit subsidiary  gridsense and ussi 
in addition  our other segment represents it and consulting activities at our dsit subsidiary 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
dsit solutions in  dsit increased its focus on marketing and developing its energy and security sonar solutions and products  particularly its products related to underwater security for energy and other strategic sites 
revenue of our dsit subsidiary decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due to decreased revenue in the energy security sonar solutions segment from million in to million in while other revenue representing certain it and consulting work performed by dsit increased slightly million 
fourth quarter revenue for dsit was million reflecting a significant increase over fourth quarter revenue of million 
fourth quarter revenues were also well above third quarter revenues million 
the increase in fourth quarter revenues was due to dsit s recent receipt of its largest order ever million for underwater security systems 
the contract calls for the delivery of a large number of aquashield diver detection sonar dds and pointshield portable diver detection sonar pdds systems to protect offshore oil platforms  coastal energy terminals and high value vessels against underwater intrusion and sabotage 
dsit began delivery of the systems in the fourth quarter of dsit s decreased revenues in compared to was due to the completion of an aquashield dds project in the end of without another project to replace those lost revenues 
furthermore  work on another aquashield tm dds project slowed down in due to the delay in an expected follow up order of a large expansion to the project changing the configuration of the already ordered dds systems 
the receipt of the recent million order and delivery of systems in the fourth quarter reversed the trend of declining revenues for dsit during gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects a decrease of million or from million in dsit s gross profit of million during the fourth quarter of represented a million increase over dsit s gross profit in the fourth quarter of the decrease in the year on year gross profit was attributable to both decreased revenues and gross margins in dsit s energy sonar security projects 
the increase in dsit s quarter on quarter gross profit was due to the revenues recognized associated with the recent million aquashield tm dds systems order and the high margins associated with that order 
fourth quarter gross profit was also million above third quarter gross profit million due to the revenue recognized and associated with the aforementioned aquashield tm systems 
dsit s gross margin in was  down from s gross margin of 
this followed a slight decrease in its gross margin from in the decrease in gross margin in was attributable to the slow down of work on an aquashield tm dds project which caused deterioration in the gross margin associated with that project 
in addition  decreased margins in a number of non naval projects in our energy sonar security solutions segment occurred when we encountered technological difficulties which caused greater than expected labor costs to bring those projects to completion 
fourth quarter gross margin was as compared to in the fourth quarter of and in the third quarter of the increase in gross margins in the fourth quarter of was due to increased margins associated with the new project received in the fourth quarter of during  dsit recorded approximately million of selling  general and administrative sg a expense as compared to approximately million recorded during the increase in dsit sg a expense is attributable to increased marketing costs million which offset decreased other general and administrative costs 
dsit recorded a net income of million in million in and million in 
the decrease of million from to was due to the decreased gross profit which resulted from lower revenues and gross margins and increased developments costs million and sg a expenses million which were partially offset by a decrease in income tax expenses million 
dsit s backlog at december  was approximately million of which it expects to recognize approximately million in dsit expects to show significant revenue growth in compared to due to revenue it expects to recognize on it recently received million order and additional orders it expects to receive during dsit s level of profitability in will be affected by anticipated increased development and marketing costs as dsit 
table of contents looks to expand its product portfolio and its marketing activities 
energy security sonar solutions during  and  revenues from our energy security sonar solutions segment in our dsit subsidiary were million  million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately  and of dsit s revenues for  and  respectively 
the balance of dsit s revenues of million  million and million for the years ending december   and were derived from dsit s other it and consulting activities 
this segment s revenues decreased by million or in as compared to while in  this segment s revenues increased by million or as compared to the decrease in revenues was due to the completion of an aquashield dds project in the end of without another project to replace those lost revenues until the receipt of the recent million order received in december furthermore  work on another aquashield tm dds project slowed down in due to the delay in an expected follow up order of a large expansion to the project changing the configuration of the already ordered dds systems 
segment gross profit decreased in as compared to to million from million following an increase in from from million in to million in the decreased gross profit in as compared to was due to decreased revenues of our energy and sonar solutions products combined with reductions in gross margins which decreased from in to in the reduced margins in were caused the previously mentioned slow down of work on an aquashield tm dds project and decreased margins in a number of non naval projects 
we anticipate significant growth in sales in  particularly from our acoustic and sonar solutions projects as a result of our increased backlog with our revenues from embedded hardware and software development projects expected to remain relatively stable 
we anticipate new customers from new regions primarily asia based placing orders for our sonar and acoustic products in the level of dsit s net income in will further depend on amounts we choose to invest in expanded research and development and marketing efforts 
gridsense in  gridsense continued to focus on delivering solutions that address the power quality and reliability needs of utilities 
each of gridsense s main product lines the line iq  cable iq  powermonic and transformer iq addresses different aspects of the power delivery system 
in addition to its existing product range  gridsense continues to invest in new technology which may lead to the commercialization of new products and revenue drivers for the business 
gridsense intends to expand its transformer monitoring capabilities and is expected to launch derivative products related to the transformeriq tm in future periods 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we began consolidating the results of gridsense beginning may   the date we acquired the outstanding gridsense shares not previously owned by us 
accordingly  full year results for and years prior were not included in acorn s consolidated financial statements 
in  gridsense recorded revenues of million  more than doubling s full year revenues of million 
the increase of million or from to was primarily due to an order gridsense received in june from a leading electric utility in the southeastern usa to use gridsense s transformeriq tm to monitor over  transformers in one metropolitan county of its service territory 
this project is expected to be a showcase for smart grid distribution optimization demonstrating the scalability and impact of affordable monitoring solutions on electric reliability 
the american recovery and reinvestment act provided half the funding for this project 
in  gross profit was million compared with s full year gross profit of million representing an increase of million or from to the gross margin percentage decreased in to compared to in the decrease in gross margin was due to non recurring production set up costs related to large initial production batch runs of certain products 
in future periods  we expect the gross margin percentage to rebound to historical levels of or greater 
in  gridsense s us operations contributed approximately million to gridsense s total revenue compared to approximately million in  an increase of over 
the increase in revenues is attributable to the june order gridsense received from a leading electric utility in the southeastern usa to use its transformeriq tm to monitor over  transformers 
the order was completed in australia operations contributed approximately million of revenues in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is attributable to the adoption of new products such as a new powermonic tm version capable of remote communications which was launched during the year 

table of contents gridsense s full year revenues by main product lines for  and are as follows in thousands of u 
s dollars powermonic line iq transformer iq other total revenues are prior to acorn s acquisition of gridsense 
revenues include revenues for the period prior to acorn s acquisition of gridsense in may sales across all major product lines increased in compared to management expects sales for all product lines to continue to grow as market conditions continue to improve 
in  line iq sales represented of gridsense s revenues while transformer iq sales represented of overall company sales 
management expects sales from both the line iq and transformer iq to represent a greater portion of overall sales in the future 
these product lines are expected to drive sales growth for the company 
the line iq product family has introduced a newly redesigned advanced sensor which improves both the functionality and price of its predecessor product 
this new sensor will be available to customers during due to the improved cost of deploying this line monitoring system  utilities will be able to justify larger scale roll outs 
management expects increases in the size of deployment with existing line iq users as well as adoption by new utility customers 
the transformer iq was commercially introduced during during  gridsense was awarded a sizeable order by a us utility to monitor a fleet of over  transformers  validating the technology and market demand 
since fulfillment of this large order  gridsense has generated traction with other utility customers involving various applications of transformer monitoring 
management expects growth from new customers as a number of prospective utility customers are in various stages of evaluating transformeriq tm in pilots or trials 
in addition  increased marketing and sales efforts is expected to expand gridsense s market penetration 
ussi in  ussi continued to focus on customer proof of concept contracts for its major product lines 
in particular  ussi had revenue related to proof of concept contracts for its d reservoir and shale gas monitoring  from fiber optic perimeter security systems and government contract revenue from fiber optic underwater security system development for diver detection 
in  full year revenues were million compared to million in the increase of million or from to was due primarily to the interest of the oil and gas market in entering into proof of concept contracts for ussi s downhole and marine seismic products 
ussi s full year revenues by main markets for and are as follows in thousands of u 
s dollars oil gas commercial security defense total revenues include revenues for the period prior to acorn s effective acquisition of ussi in february 
table of contents in  full year gross profit was a negative  compared to a positive  in the decline is primarily due to increased engineering and production costs as ussi transitions from development of its products to production 
ussi is currently engaged in developing cost cutting measures for the manufacturing of its commercial products  including investment in equipment that will make manufacturing more efficient and improving the production process that will ultimately result in less man hours required for each product sold 
furthermore  ussi expects that its gross margin will grow as it benefits from allocating its fixed costs over a larger revenue base and as it begins to utilize lower cost personnel in its production 
we anticipate significant growth in revenues in  particularly from new customers related to our d reservoir shale gas monitoring systems following the numerous demonstrations scheduled for early as well as follow on projects from our existing proof of concept projects  each of which has the potential for annual multi million dollar follow up orders 
we also anticipate significantly increased costs as we have grown our employee base from seven at the end of to full time employees including eight full time consultants as of december  ussi expects to continue to grow its engineering and operations staff into coalogix on august   acorn completed the sale of its majority owned coalogix inc subsidiary coalogix pursuant to which acorn and the other owner of coalogix sold all the outstanding capital stock of coalogix for million subject to certain adjustments in cash 
acorn owned approximately of coalogix on a fully diluted basis and received million in consideration for its coalogix shares  of which million was deposited in an escrow account to secure possible indemnification claims which acorn expects to be released by august  and  which was deposited in an escrow account against a possible working capital shortfall and which was released to acorn in the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of acorn s shares of the common stock of coalogix  acorn recorded a gain of million included in the gain is approximately  which was received as part of an additional working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of 
acorn also recorded income taxes of approximately million based on a federal income tax rate of 
the net gain of million is reflected in acorn s condensed consolidated statement of operations as a gain on the sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
coreworx on november   following a decision by acorn s board of directors to cease providing funding for coreworx  acorn entered into a letter of intent with coreworx for acorn to sell all of its common stock in coreworx to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors 
the management buyout transaction was consummated on december   following which acorn retained a interest in coreworx  warrants to acquire an additional of coreworx  million of coreworx debt and a  restructuring fee due from coreworx on july  acorn did not attribute any value to any of the above on its financial statements of december  on october   acorn sold its stake in coreworx and the entire million of coreworx debt  its right to royalties and the  restructuring fee which was at the time still unpaid back to coreworx for  the company recorded a  gain net of income taxes of  on the transaction in gain on the sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
acorn still retains its warrants to acquire of coreworx and continues not to ascribe any value to those warrants 
corporate corporate general and administrative expense in reflected a million decrease to million as compared to million of expense in the decrease in corporate general and administrative expense in is primarily attributable to decreased professional fees associated with certain activities an sec inquiry regarding our sales of comverge stock  a registered direct offering and our acquisitions and dispositions  as well as decreased compensation costs primarily attributable to reduced stock compensation expense in these decreases were partially offset by increased investor relations costs 
fourth quarter corporate general and administrative expense of million reflected a million increase as compared to the third quarter corporate general and administrative expense primarily due to corporate bonuses 
we expect our annual corporate general and administrative costs to increase in as compared to we anticipate increasing our investor relation costs as well as incurring increasing personnel costs associated with compensation increases 
we have hired a senior director of external relations who is available to assist our subsidiaries with marketing and  in the case of our us subsidiaries  certain legislative and other governmental relations matters 
we have also retained one of our directors as a paid consultant to work with our operating companies in developing and monitoring their business plans  provide investor relations services in europe and help identify acquisition and partnership opportunities 

table of contents critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies  which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  business combinations  impairments in goodwill and intangible assets  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions and stock based compensation 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in other entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and or our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investee s net income or losses after the date of investment 
when net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount  the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not recorded 
we resume accounting for the investment under the equity method when the entity subsequently reports net income and our share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
in the year ending december   we began consolidating the results of ussi effective february  following the signing of option agreements with ussi and certain shareholders of ussi whereby we received options to acquire up to of the company see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
we also began consolidating the results of gridsense on may  following our acquisition of the approximately of the company we did not previously own see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
on december   we ceased consolidating the results of coreworx following the sale of all of our common stock in the company to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
on august   we ceased consolidating the results of coalogix following the sale of all of our common stock in the company see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
the results of coalogix and coreworx are presented as discontinued operations for all the periods since our acquisition of them in november and august  respectively 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as an amortizable intangible asset  a non amortizable intangible asset or goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of our amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from three to twenty years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 

table of contents goodwill and intangibles as a result of our various acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and various amortizable intangible assets 
businesses acquired are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
our goodwill at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
our goodwill is allocated to our segments as follows energy security sonar solutions approximately million  gridsense approximately million and ussi approximately million 
our intangible assets that have finite useful lives recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition  and are carried at such value less accumulated amortization 
our net intangible asset balance at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
the composition of our intangible assets at december  consisted of naval technologies in our energy security sonar solutions segment million  net of accumulated amortization  software and customer relationships in our gridsense segment million  net of accumulated amortization and sensor technologies in our ussi segment million  net of accumulated amortization 
we amortize these intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
each of our reportable operating segments energy security sonar solutions  gridsense and ussi is deemed to be a reporting unit 
these reporting units have been identified based on appropriate accounting principles  which considers  among other things  the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to a reporting unit as of the date of acquisition 
in the event we reorganize our business  we reassign the assets including goodwill and liabilities among the affected reporting units 
our corporate activities and those relating to our non reporting segment are not assigned to our reporting units 
we periodically review these reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which the business is operated 
we also analyze whether any indicators of impairment for goodwill and intangibles exist each quarter 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of our long lived assets  and or slower growth rates  among others 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment 
this guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
as discussed more fully in note a to the consolidated financial statements  we early adopted this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted in the fourth quarter of if we had determined that was necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test  we would determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions by management 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  there is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and a second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized  if any 
the first step of our annual evaluation in the two step goodwill impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine whether there is an indicator of potential impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we conduct a second step  in which we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets such as the assembled workforce as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using discounted expected future cash flows 
we perform a valuation analysis  utilizing an income approach in our goodwill assessment process 
the following describes the valuation methodology 
table of contents typically used to derive the fair value of our reporting units 
income approach to determine each reporting unit s estimated fair value  we discount the expected cash flows of our reporting units 
we estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends  estimated future operating results  growth rates  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions  and the availability of necessary technology 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model  we use a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we use estimated operating income before depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model  adjust it to estimate a normalized cash flow  apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
the preparation of the long range forecasts  the selection of the discount rates and the estimation of the multiples used in valuing the terminal year involve significant judgments 
changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
for  as required  the company performed an annual impairment test of recorded goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if impairment indicators or triggering events are present 
as previously noted  in september  the fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment by permitting entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
we early adopted this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted in the fourth quarter of in performing the goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units  we assessed the relevant qualitative factors and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts 
after reaching this conclusion  no further testing was performed 
the qualitative factors we considered included  but were not limited to  general economic conditions  industry and market conditions  pipeline and backlog  our recent and projected financial performance and the price of the company s common stock 
revenue recognition revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services is recognized as services are provided 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our dsit subsidiary 
in  dsit derived approximately million or of its revenues from fixed price type contracts 
fixed price type contracts require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized for a particular period  using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and margins may be significantly and negatively affected and losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
in  gridsense recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year 
revenue from sales of gridsense monitoring equipment is recognized at the time title to the equipment and significant risks of ownership pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from customer support services on monitoring equipment includes sales of parts and servicing of equipment 
sales of parts revenue is recognized when the parts are shipped to the customer or when the part is installed in the customer s equipment 
servicing of equipment revenue is recognized as the related service work is performed 
in  ussi recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year 
revenue from sales of ussi equipment is recognized at the time title to the equipment and significant risks of ownership pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar

their financial statements have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statements of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year or the specific exchange rate on the date of a specific transaction 
all exchange gains and losses denominated in non functional currencies are reflected in finance expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of applicable accounting principles  using the black scholes option valuation method 
accordingly  we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the black scholes method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
the expected volatility factor used to value stock options in was based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock over a period equal to the estimated weighted average life of the options 
for the expected term of the option  we used an estimate of the expected option life based on historical experience 
the risk free interest rate used is based upon us treasury yields for a period consistent with the expected term of the options 
historically  we had not paid dividends up until the decision by our board in october to pay a quarterly dividend of beginning in november accordingly  our expected dividend rate was zero for all option grants prior to october subsequent to the declaration of the quarterly dividend  our expected dividend rate was approximately 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the prescribed methodology  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of stock based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our selling  general and administrative and other items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
we are also required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred stock compensation expense with respect to options of approximately  million and million  respectively

gridsense s revenue for was million compared to million in since we began consolidating results in may ussi s revenue for was million compared to million in since we began consolidating its results in february the decrease in dsit s energy security sonar solutions revenues was due to decreased revenue from dsit s aquashield projects which resulted from a project which was completed in late gridsense s increased revenue were attributable to increased revenue in both its u 
s and australian operations 
the increased revenue in its us operations was due to an order gridsense received in june from a leading electric utility in the southeastern usa to use gridsense s transformeriq tm to monitor over  transformers in one metropolitan county of its service territory 
the increased revenues in its australian operations was attributable to the adoption of new products such as a new powermonic tm version capable of remote communications which was launched during the year

gridsense s gross profit for was million compared to million in since we began consolidating its results in may ussi s gross profit for was a negative  compared to a marginal gross profit of  in since we began consolidating its results in february the decrease in dsit gross profits was attributable to both decreased revenues and a decrease in consolidated gross margins from in to in dsit s decline in gross margins was due to the slow down of work on an aquashield tm dds project which caused deterioration in the gross margin associated with that project as well as decreased margins in a number of non naval projects in our energy sonar security solutions segment which encountered technological difficulties to bring those projects to completion 
gridsense s increase in gross profits was wholly attributable to its increased revenues as its gross margin declined slightly from in to in gridsense s decreased gross margin is due to non recurring production set up costs related to large initial production batch runs of certain products

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits of million  million of funds held in escrow and current restricted deposits of million 
net cash and cash equivalents increased during the year ended december  by million 
approximately million was used in operating activities of our continuing operations during the year 
the primary use of cash in our operating activities during the year ended december  was the cash used in operations by our ussi and gridsense subsidiaries million and million  respectively combined with the approximately million of cash used in our corporate operating activities 
the million of cash used in our corporate activities includes tax payments of approximately million on our expected taxable income for these uses of cash were partially offset by the million of cash provided by dsit s operating activities during the year 
net cash provided by investment activities of million was primarily from the proceeds from the sale of our interest in coalogix million of which million was placed in escrow and million was subsequently released in and the sale of our interest in hangxing million 
this was partially offset by million that was placed in short term deposits  million which was used for the acquisition of property and equipment during the year and million net of new restricted deposits during the period 
net cash of million was used in financing activities  primarily from the repayment of both long and short term debt net of long term debt borrowings of million and our dividend payment in november of million 
this was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of options million 
at december   dsit had approximately million in israeli credit lines available to it from two israeli banks approximately  from each bank  of which approximately million was then being used 
dsit s credit lines at one bank expires on september  the line of credit at the second bank formally expired on february  dsit continues to obtain credit from the bank and is currently negotiating terms of renewal 
the credit lines at the bank whose term expired in february are expected to be renewed for another year at terms similar to current terms 
the lines of credit are denominated in nis and bear interest at a weighted average rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
the lines of credit are subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
at december   dsit was in compliance with its financial covenants 
acorn has a floating lien and provided guarantees with respect to dsit s outstanding lines of credit 
as at december   dsit also has an outstanding term loan from an israeli bank in the amount of approximately  the loan is denominated in nis and bears interest at the rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the loan is to be repaid over the next months in equal payments of approximately  per month principal and interest 
as collateral for the term loan  dsit has deposited with an israeli bank approximately  as a non current restricted deposit 
in addition to this restricted deposit  dsit has also deposited with two israeli banks approximately million as collateral for various performance and bank guarantees for various projects as well as for its credit facilities at the banks 
dsit expects that most of these deposits will be released during million are recorded as current restricted deposits  but expects to redeposit a majority of these funds again as collateral for new guarantees for new projects and for renewing its credit facilities 
on february   dsit had approximately million of cash of which million was restricted million current and million non current and was utilizing approximately million of its lines of credit 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flows from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and expected continued improvement of operating results from anticipated growth in sales 
as of february   gridsense had approximately million cash on hand following acorn s transfer of million for working capital see recent developments 
during the calendar year  acorn provided gridsense with approximately million for its working capital needs 
due to seasonality and the budget cycles of utility customers  gridsense expects its operations to be cash flow negative in certain quarters and cash flow neutral or positive in other quarters 
in order to attempt to accelerate its growth  gridsense may require additional working capital 
in the long term  while gridsense continues to have a strong sales pipeline  and we believe that it will be able to replicate large scale projects similar to the transformeriqtm project in the future  the timing of these projects is difficult to predict and there may be delays in getting awarded such contracts 
as a result  we have no assurance that gridsense will be able to maintain its increased sales or be able to reduce its need for additional financing to support its working capital needs in and beyond 
accordingly  gridsense may continue to need additional working capital support  while it works to increase its sales 
this support may be in the form of a bank line  additional investment or loan by acorn  or a combination of the above 
gridsense is currently in discussions with a bank to provide working capital financing  however  there is no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner 
table of contents or on acceptable terms 
ussi currently has no other sources of financing other than its internally generated sales and investments by acorn 
on february   we entered into the ussi purchase agreement with ussi pursuant to which we converted previously advanced funds million during the period from may to january into additional shares of ussi common stock and shares of ussi preferred stock see recent developments 
we also made a further payment to ussi of million february  to purchase additional shares of ussi preferred stock  and we anticipate that we will purchase more shares of ussi preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million at a future date 
this subsequent purchase is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions 
as of february   ussi had cash on hand of approximately million 
we have no assurance that ussi will not need additional financing from time to time to finance its working capital needs 
additional financing for ussi may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  a loan or investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
as at march   the company s corporate operations not including cash at any of our subsidiaries had a total of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents reflecting a million decrease from the balance as of december  the decrease in corporate cash is primarily due the acquisition of omnimetrix for million see recent developments  to an additional advance  and investments million in ussi see recent developments  million dividends a special dividend paid in january and our regular quarterly dividend paid on march  see recent developments  a transfer to gridsense of million and our corporate expenses 
we believe that the cash remaining from the sale of coalogix will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance the operating activities of acorn and the operations of its operating subsidiaries for the foreseeable future and for the next months in particular 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below provides information concerning obligations under certain categories of our contractual obligations as of december  cash payments due to contractual obligations years ending december  in thousands total and thereafter bank and other debt  utilized lines of credit and capital leases operating leases potential severance obligations total contractual cash obligations we expect to finance these contractual commitments from cash currently on hand and cash generated from operations 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment under certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   we accrued a total of million for potential severance obligations to our israeli employees of which approximately million was funded 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements our dsit subsidiary provides various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and a majority were due to expire in and as security for a portion of these guarantees  dsit has deposited approximately million which is shown as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets million as current restricted cash and million as non current restricted cash 
as dsit s restricted cash is released from the completion of projects and the end of the guarantees  it expects to 
table of contents provide additional security deposits for new guarantees for new projects throughout the calendar year 
impact of inflation and interest rate currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our lines of credit million available and long term debt incurred million balance at december  to finance our operations in israel 
such lines of credit and loan bear interest at interest rates that are linked to the israeli prime rate at december  and at december  
our non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities net liabilities of approximately million at december  in israel are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  a majority of dsit s sales have been denominated in dollars or denominated in nis linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are often settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
as dsit increases its sales to customers outside of israel  a greater portion of its receipts from customers will be settled in dollars 
in  we expect an increasing portion of dsit s sales to be settled in dollars 
a significant majority of dsit s expenses in israel are in nis primarily labor costs  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the appreciation of the dollar against the nis was while in the nis appreciated against the dollar by 
as of december   virtually all of dsit s monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
dsit purchases forward contracts to attempt to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition  our non us dollar assets and liabilities net liability of approximately million at december  in australia at our gridsense subsidiary s australian operations are also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the dollar cost of our operations in australia may also be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the australian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
in the australian dollar was virtually unchanged against the us dollar

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk general we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our financial instruments  including derivatives  if any 
a financial instrument is defined as cash  evidence of an ownership interest in an entity  or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual obligation either to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument to or from a second entity 
examples of financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  deposits  trade accounts receivable  loans  investments  trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  options and forward contracts 
the disclosures below include  among other matters  the nature and terms of derivative transactions  information about significant concentrations of credit risk  and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currency risk the translation of the balance sheets of our israeli operations from nis into us dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as are the balance sheets of our australian operations from australian dollars into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded either as cumulative translation adjustments cta within stockholders equity  or foreign exchange gains or losses in the statement of operations 
in the u 
s dollar strengthened in relation to the nis by 
in the australian dollar was virtually unchanged against the us dollar 
to test the sensitivity of these operations to fluctuations in the exchange rate  the hypothetical change in cta and foreign exchange gains and losses is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non us operations by a change in the currency exchange rates 
as of december   a weakening of the us dollar against the nis and against the australian dollar would have increased stockholders equity by approximately  arising from a cta adjustment of approximately  and net exchange losses of approximately 
these hypothetical changes are based on adjusting the december  exchange rates by 
our dsit subsidiary enters into various forward contracts which do not qualify as hedging instruments under accounting principles to try to mitigate its foreign currency exposure risks 
at december   dsit had entered into monthly forward contracts through july to purchase us dollars ranging from  to  per month at exchange rates ranging from to in order to mitigate risk to its nis denominated expenses 
gridsense does not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values due to the short maturity of such investments 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt and deposits with similar terms and remaining maturities
