like home health  hospice operations are also organized in a single division  which is staffed with clinical  operational  human resource  finance and sales teams 
the division is separated into five geographic regions  which in turn are further separated into geographic operating areas  each of which includes branch locations 
comprehensive management of the healthcare services and products needed by hospice patients and their families are provided through the use of an interdisciplinary team

business environment factors that the company believes have contributed and will contribute to the development of its home health and hospice business segments include recognition that home health and hospice services can be a cost effective alternative to more expensive institutional care  aging demographics  changing family structures in which more aging people will be living alone and may be in need of assistance  increasing consumer and physician awareness and interest in home health and hospice services  the psychological benefits of recuperating from an illness or accident or receiving care for a chronic condition in one s own home  clinical specialization  and medical and technological advances that allow more health care procedures and monitoring to be provided at home 
marketing and sales home health and hospice 
in general  the company s home health and hospice businesses obtain patients and clients through personal and corporate sales presentations  telephone marketing calls  direct mail solicitation  referrals from other clients and advertising in a variety of local and national media  including the yellow pages  newspapers  magazines  trade publications and radio 
the company maintains a dedicated sales force responsible for generating local  regional and national referrals  as well as an internet website www 
gentiva 
com that describes the company  its services and products 
marketing efforts also involve personal contact with physicians  hospital discharge planners and case managers for managed healthcare programs  such as those involving health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  and insurance company representatives 
referral sources for hospice services also include nursing homes  assisted living facilities  community social service organizations and faith based organizations 
competitive position home health 
the home health services industry in which the company operates is highly competitive and fragmented 
home healthcare providers range from facility based agencies hospital  nursing home  rehabilitation facility  government agency to independent companies to visiting nurse associations and nurse registries 
they can be not for profit organizations or for profit organizations 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home health services markets in which the company operates 
in addition to several publicly held companies  the company s primary competitors for its home healthcare business are hospital based home health agencies  local home health agencies and visiting nurse associations 
based on available information  the company believes that its home health services business held approximately a percent medicare home health reimbursement market share in the company competes with other home healthcare providers on the basis of availability of personnel  quality and expertise of services and the value and price of services 
the company believes that it has a favorable competitive position  attributable mainly to the consistently high quality and targeted services it has provided over the years to its patients  as well as to its screening and evaluation procedures and training programs for clinical associates who provide direct care to patients 
the company expects that industry forces will impact it and its competitors 
the company s competitors will likely strive to improve their service offerings and price competitiveness in non government reimbursed programs 
the company also expects its competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers  referral sources and payers  which could result in increased competition 
the introduction of new and enhanced services  acquisitions and industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s services or price competition  or make the company s services less attractive 
hospice 
the hospice care industry is very competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with not for profit and charity funded hospice programs that may have strong ties to their local medical communities and with for profit programs that may have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
the company also competes with a number of hospitals  nursing homes  long term care facilities  home health agencies and other healthcare providers that offer hospice care or hospice like care to patients who are terminally ill 
based on available information and giving effect to odyssey s medicare reimbursed hospice operations in  the company believes that its hospice operations would have held approximately a percent medicare hospice reimbursement market share in source and availability of personnel home health and hospice 
to maximize the cost effectiveness and productivity of clinical associates  the company utilizes customized processes and procedures that have been developed and refined over the years 
personalized matching to recruit and select applicants who fit the patients individual needs is achieved through initial applicant profiles  personal interviews  skill evaluations and background and reference checks 
the company utilizes its proprietary casematch software scheduling program  which gives local company offices the ability to identify those clinical associates who can be assigned to patient cases 
clinical associates are recruited through a variety of sources  including advertising in local and national media  job fairs  solicitations on websites  direct mail and telephone solicitations  as well as referrals obtained directly from clients and other caregivers 
clinical associates are paid on a per visit  per hour or per diem basis  or are employed on a full time salaried basis 
the company  along with its competitors  is currently experiencing a shortage of licensed professionals  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
number of persons employed at december  and december   the company employed full time administrative  sales associates and clinical associates on both a salaried and pay per visit basis  who were also eligible for benefits  as follows as of year end clinical associates home health salaried employees pay per visit total home health hospice total clinical associates administrative and sales associates total the company also employs clinical associates on a temporary basis  as needed  to provide home health services 
in  the average number of temporary clinical associates employed on a weekly basis in the company s home health and hospice businesses was approximately  compared to approximately  in the company had approximately full time associates at december  associated with the rehab without walls business and homemaker services business in illinois and averaged temporary clinical associates in those businesses on a weekly basis in both during the period in which the company owned such businesses and the company believes that its relationships with its employees are generally good 
government regulations the company s business is subject to extensive federal  state and  in some instances  local regulations and standards which govern  among other things medicare  medicaid  tricare the department of defense s managed healthcare program for military personnel and their families and other government funded reimbursement programs  reporting requirements  certification and licensing standards for certain home health agencies and hospice  and in some cases  certificate of need requirements 
the company s compliance with these regulations and standards may affect its participation in medicare  medicaid  tricare and other federal and state healthcare programs 
for example  to participate in the medicare program  a medicare beneficiary must be under the care of a physician  have an intermittent need for skilled nursing or physical or other therapy care  must be homebound and must receive home healthcare services from a medicare certified home healthcare agency 
the company is also subject to a variety of federal and state regulations which prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services 
these regulations include  among other things prohibitions against the offering or making of direct or indirect payments to actual or potential referral sources for obtaining or influencing patient referrals  rules generally prohibiting physicians from making referrals under medicare for clinical services to a home health agency with which the physician or his or her immediate family member has certain types of financial relationships  laws against the filing of false claims  and laws against making payment or offering items of value to patients to induce their self referral to the provider 
as part of the extensive federal and state regulations and standards  the company is subject to periodic audits  examinations and investigations conducted by  or at the direction of  governmental investigatory and oversight agencies 
periodic and random audits conducted or directed by these agencies could result in a delay in receipt or an adjustment to the amount of reimbursements due or received under medicare  medicaid  tricare and other federal and state health programs 
violation of the applicable federal and state healthcare regulations can result in the company s exclusion from participating in these programs and can subject the company to substantial civil and or criminal penalties 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance with these regulations and standards 
home health the centers for medicare medicaid services cms have implemented various payment updates to the base rates for medicare home health including i annual market basket updates  ii annual reductions in rates to reduce aggregate case mix increases that cms believes are unrelated to patients health status case mix creep adjustment  iii adjustments to rates associated with changes to the home health outlier policy and iv wage index and other changes 
in addition  as a result of the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act  a percent increase in medicare payments for home health services in defined rural areas of the country the rural add on provision was implemented effective april  during  approximately percent of the company s episodic revenue was generated in designated rural areas 
in november  cms implemented final changes to medicare home health payments for calendar year  which represented a net decrease in reimbursement of approximately percent to a base episodic rate of  for as compared to a base episodic rate of  for on october   cms issued the final rule to update and revise medicare home health payments for calendar year this is comprised of a net market basket update of percent  which includes the percent reduction mandated by the affordable care act  offset by a case mix creep adjustment of percent in the net effect of these changes decreases the base rate for an episode of service by percent to  in addition  the final rule states that the medicare home health rates for calendar year will include an additional negative percent change in case mix adjustment 
the final rule also shifts case mix points from high case mix and high therapy episodes to low case mix and non therapy episodes 
the shift from high therapy episodes and the removal of two hypertension codes may also have a negative impact on the company s revenues in in addition to the base rate decrease 
a summary of the components of gentiva s annual medicare home health reimbursement adjustments follows calendar year net market basket update case mix creep adjustment outlier payment adjustment rural add on other net reimbursement change base episodic rate actual episodic rates will vary from the base episodic rates noted in the table above due to i the determination of case mix which reflects the clinical condition  functional abilities and service needs of each individual patient  ii wage indices applicable to the geographic region where the services are performed and iii the impact of the rural add on provision 
as a condition for medicare payment  the affordable care act mandates that prior to certifying a patient s eligibility for the home health benefit  the certifying physician must document that the physician or an allowed non physician practitioner  had a face to face encounter with the patient 
the encounter must occur within days prior to the start of care or days after the start of care 
in addition  the affordable care act requires that a hospice physician or nurse practitioner have a face to face encounter with hospice patients during the day period prior to the th day recertification and each subsequent recertification  and that the certifying hospice physician attest that such a visit took place 
the face to face requirements for home health and hospice providers became effective january  however  cms delayed full enforcement of the requirements until april  in addition  in july  cms proposed comparable face to face encounters for people receiving medicaid home health services 
the affordable care act also imposed additional therapy assessment requirements 
a professional qualified therapist assessment must take place at least once every days during a therapy patient s course of treatment 
for those qualified patients needing or more or or more therapy visits  a qualified therapist must perform the therapy service required  re assess the patient  and measure and document the effectiveness of the th visit and the th visit for all therapy disciplines caring for the patient 
the new therapy assessment requirements were effective april  hospice effective october   cms implemented an increase of percent for medicare hospice rates  consisting of a percent market basket increase  offset by a percent budget neutrality adjustment factor 
in july  cms released a final rule  effective october   that provided for a percent increase for medicare hospice rates  consisting of a percent market basket increase  offset by a percent decrease due to updated wage index data and a budget neutrality adjustment factor 
overall payments made by medicare for hospice services are subject to cap amounts calculated by medicare 
total medicare payments for hospice services are compared to the aggregate cap amount for the hospice cap period 
in may  cms announced the cap amount for the cap year of  per beneficiary  which was from november  through october  seasonality during the third quarter  the company has historically experienced a moderate seasonal decline in volume as well as a decline in gross profit percentage for its home health services  due to increased labor costs associated with higher utilization of paid time off by the company s clinical associates during this period 
during the fourth quarter  the company s hospice business historically experiences a decline in admissions surrounding the holiday season

item a 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements which involve a number of risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as discussed in more detail above under item business special caution regarding forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  without limitation  the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in such case  you may lose all or part of your investment in our company s securities 
risks related to our business and industry our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the credit agreement and senior notes 
we are highly leveraged 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately million 
we also had then an additional million since reduced to million as a result of an amendment to our credit agreement entered into on march  available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities without taking into account approximately million of letters of credit that we have issued 
our high degree of leverage could have important consequences  including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  making it more difficult for us to make payments on the senior notes  increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non strategic divestitures  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged than we are 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow  and future financings may not be able to provide sufficient proceeds  to meet these obligations or to execute our business strategy successfully 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain various covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on  repurchase  or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  make certain investments  sell certain assets  create liens  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants or failure to maintain or satisfy a financial ratio or test could result in a default under one or more of these agreements 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit agreement  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under our credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if the lenders under our credit agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit agreement as well as our unsecured indebtedness  including the senior notes 
our inability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment 
our credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
while we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement at december   changes in our business climate and uncertainties involving medicare reimbursement may affect our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement  which  among other material changes  increased our permitted maximum consolidated leverage ratio and decreased our required minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio 
if we do not meet our financial covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of our credit agreement or other permitted remedies  we would default under our credit agreement which would allow our lenders to accelerate the amounts we owe under our credit agreement  or avail themselves of other remedies under the credit agreement  including foreclosure on the collateral securing our debt 
as a result  any breach of our financial covenants may have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
despite our high indebtedness  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional amounts of debt  which could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 
under the terms of our credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
in addition  as of december   we had million since reduced to million as a result of an amendment to our credit agreement entered into on march  available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility without taking into account approximately million of letters of credit that we have issued 
these borrowings and any other secured indebtedness permitted under agreements governing our indebtedness would be effectively senior to the senior notes and their guarantees to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries existing debt levels  the related risks that we now face would increase 
we may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect to realize as a result of our acquisition of odyssey or other future acquisitions 
failure to achieve such benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings  revenue enhancements  or other synergies from our acquisition of odyssey or other future acquisitions  either in the amount or within the time frame that we expect 
in addition  the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than  and the timing may differ from  what we expect 
our ability to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies  and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following the use of more cash or other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect  increases in other expenses unrelated to the acquisition  which may offset the cost savings and other synergies from the acquisition  our ability to eliminate duplicative back office overhead and redundant selling  general  and administrative functions  and our ability to avoid labor disruptions in connection with any integration  particularly in connection with any headcount reduction 
specifically  while we expect the acquisition of odyssey to create significant opportunities to reduce our combined operating costs  these cost savings reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management  and it is possible that our actual results will not reflect these estimates and assumptions within our anticipated time frame or at all 
if we fail to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements  our financial results may be adversely affected  and we may not generate the cash flow from operations that we anticipate 
we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses that we may acquire in the future with gentiva 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results is dependent on our ability to successfully integrate businesses that we may acquire in the future with gentiva 
the process of integrating acquired businesses  involves risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to demands on management related to the significant increase in the size of our business  diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices  difficulties in conforming the acquired company s accounting policies to ours  retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of departments  information technology systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records  procedures and maintaining uniform standards  such as internal accounting controls  procedures  and policies  and costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may result in reduced levels of revenue  earnings  or operating efficiency than might have been achieved if we had not acquired such businesses 
in addition  any future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense  contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our growth strategy may not be successful 
the future growth of our business and our future financial performance will depend on  among other things  our ability to increase our revenue base through a combination of internal growth and strategic ventures  including acquisitions 
future revenue growth cannot be assured  as it is subject to various risk factors  including our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits  including leveraging referral sources  the effects of competition  pending initiatives concerning the levels of medicare  medicaid and private health insurance reimbursement and uncertainty concerning reimbursements in the future  our ability to generate new and retain existing contracts with major payer sources  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  especially in a business environment experiencing a shortage of clinical professionals  our ability to identify  negotiate and consummate desirable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms  our ability to integrate effectively and retain the business acquired by us through acquisitions we have made or may make  and the requirement for obtaining medicare licenses and certificates of need to operate in certain jurisdictions 
an element of our growth strategy is expansion of our business by developing new hospice programs in new markets and growth in our existing markets 
this aspect of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify markets that meet our selection criteria for new hospice programs  hire and retain a qualified management team to operate each of our new hospice programs  manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice programs  become medicare and medicaid certified in new markets  generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets  or compete effectively with existing programs in new markets 
according to the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  an estimated percent of hospice programs in the united states are not for profit programs 
accordingly  it is likely that a number of acquisition opportunities may involve hospices operated by not for profit entities 
in recent years  several states have increased review and oversight of transactions involving the sale of healthcare facilities and businesses by not for profit entities 
although the level of review varies from state to state  the current trend is to provide for increased governmental review  and in some cases approval  of transactions in which a not for profit entity sells a healthcare facility or business 
this increased scrutiny may increase the difficulty in completing  or prevent the completion of  acquisitions in some states in the future 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians  nursing homes  assisted living facilities  adult care centers  hospitals  managed care companies  insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities where our home health and hospice locations serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home health or hospice patients to us and may refer their patients to other home health or hospice care providers  or not at all 
our growth and profitability depend significantly on our ability to provide good patient and family care  to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
moreover  we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of home health and hospice care will increase 
competition among home healthcare and hospice companies is intense 
the home health and hospice services industry is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of other companies in providing home health services and hospice services  some of which may have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities 
competing companies may offer newer or different services from those offered by us and may thereby attract customers who are presently receiving our home health or hospice services 
in many areas in which our home health and hospice programs are located  we compete with a large number of organizations  including community based home health and hospice providers  national and regional companies  hospital based home health agencies  hospice and palliative care programs  and nursing homes 
some of our current and potential competitors have or may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial resources than we have or may obtain 
relatively few barriers to entry exist in our local markets 
accordingly  other companies  including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing home health and hospice care  may expand their services to include home health services  hospice care or similar services 
we may encounter increased competition in the future that could negatively impact patient referrals to us  limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position and adversely affect our profitability 
many states have certificate of need laws or other regulatory provisions that may adversely impact our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and to increase our net patient service revenue 
many states have enacted certificate of need laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities 
those laws require some form of state agency review or approval before a hospice may add new services or undertake significant capital expenditures 
new york has additional barriers to entry 
new york places restrictions on the corporate ownership of hospices 
accordingly  our ability to operate in new york is restricted 
these laws could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets 
further consolidation of managed care organizations and other third party payers may adversely affect our profits 
managed care organizations and other third party payers have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services 
consequently  the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the united states population are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations 
these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services 
to the extent that such organizations terminate us as a preferred provider and or engage our competitors as preferred or exclusive providers  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  private payers  including managed care payers  could seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements  thereby potentially reducing our profitability 
the cost of healthcare is funded substantially by government and private insurance programs 
if this funding is reduced or becomes limited or unavailable to our customers  our business may be adversely impacted 
third party payers include medicare  medicaid and private health insurance providers 
third party payers are increasingly challenging prices charged for healthcare services 
we cannot assure you that our services will be considered cost effective by third party payers  that reimbursement will be available or that payer reimbursement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our services on a profitable basis  if at all 
we cannot control reimbursement rates  including medicare market basket or other rate adjustments 
on march   the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act affordable care act  and  on march   the president signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively the health care reform act 
the health care reform act mandates important changes to reimbursement for home health and hospice  including reductions in reimbursement levels 
see risks related to healthcare regulation beginning on page on october   cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health payments for calendar year this is comprised of a net market basket update of percent  which includes the percent reduction mandated by the affordable care act  offset by a case mix creep adjustment of percent in the net effect of these changes decreases the base rate for an episode of service by percent 
in addition  the final rule states that the medicare home health rates for calendar year will include an additional negative percent change in case mix adjustment 
the final rule also shifts case mix points from high case mix and high therapy episodes to low case mix and non therapy episodes 
the shift from high therapy episodes and the removal of two hypertension codes may also have a negative impact on our revenues in in addition to the base rate decrease 
there can be no assurance these changes will not adversely affect us 
possible changes in the case mix of patients  as well as payer mix and payment methodologies  may have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the sources and amounts of our patient revenues will be determined by a number of factors  including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payers 
changes in the case mix of the patients as well as payer mix among private pay  medicare and medicaid may significantly affect our profitability 
in particular  any significant increase in our medicaid population or decrease in medicaid payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow  especially if states operating these programs continue to limit  or more aggressively seek limits on  reimbursement rates or service levels 
the healthcare industry continues to experience shortages in qualified home health service employees and management personnel 
we compete with other healthcare providers for our employees  both clinical associates and management personnel 
as the demand for home health services and hospice services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff  we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals 
furthermore  the competitive arena for this shrinking labor market has created turnover as many seek to take advantage of the supply of available positions  each offering new and more attractive wage and benefit packages 
in addition to the wage pressures inherent in this environment  the cost of training new employees amid the turnover rates may cause added pressure on our operating margins 
a continued economic downturn  state budget pressures  sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal government may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services 
a continued economic downturn can have a detrimental effect on our revenues 
historically  state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending 
given that medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets  we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate 
in addition  an economic downturn  coupled with sustained unemployment  may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies  which could result in reduced reimbursement rates 
the existing federal deficit  as well as deficit spending by the government as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons  can lead to continuing pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes  including government funded programs in which we participate  such as medicare and medicaid 
such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations 
a prolonged disruption of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our future access to capital and our cost of capital 
the continued volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets in the united states have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
we have used the capital and credit markets for liquidity and to execute our business strategies  which include increasing our revenue base through a combination of internal growth and strategic ventures  including acquisitions 
we believe that we have adequate capital and liquidity to conduct any foreseeable initiatives that may develop over the near term  however  should current economic and market conditions continue or deteriorate further  our future cost of debt or equity capital and future access to capital markets may be adversely affected 
if an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets were to occur  our earnings would be negatively impacted 
goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets as a result of acquisitions 
goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  we have assigned to our reportable business segments the appropriate amounts of goodwill and intangible assets based upon allocations of the purchase prices of individual acquisition transactions 
as described in the notes to our financial statements  these assigned values are reviewed on an annual basis or at the time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets  in response to changes in business climate  including uncertainties around medicare reimbursement 
as a result of the process  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
should business conditions or other factors deteriorate and negatively impact the estimated realizable value of future cash flows of our business segments  we could be required to further write off a substantial portion of our assets 
depending upon the magnitude of the write off  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
if we must write off a significant amount of long lived assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
we have long lived assets consisting of fixed assets  which include software development costs related to various information technology systems 
the net carrying value of fixed assets amounted to million at december   which included deferred software developments costs of million primarily related to replacement of the company s financial and human resources systems 
we review these amounts on an annual basis or at the time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in connection with the odyssey acquisition  we conducted a strategic evaluation of our various field operating systems to review alternatives towards achieving a comprehensive platform  capable of handling both our home health and hospice business segments 
during the third quarter of  we completed our review of alternatives to replacing various field operating systems and  in connection with that review  recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million related to developed software 
in addition  we conducted a review of real estate we owned in dothan  alabama  which indicated that the estimated fair value of the real estate was lower than the carrying value  and we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
if a future determination that a significant impairment in value of our long lived assets has occurred  such determination could require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
depending upon the magnitude of the write off  our financial results could be negatively affected 
there are risks of business disruption and cost overruns associated with new business systems and technology initiatives 
we implemented new financial  payroll and human resources systems throughout implementation and future development costs in excess of expectations or the failure of new systems and other technology initiatives to operate in accordance with expectations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and operations 
we have risks related to obligations under our insurance programs 
we are obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health and welfare  workers compensation  auto and professional liability 
we may be subject to workers compensation claims and lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims 
we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks with insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles and retention amounts 
we also may be subject to exposure relating to employment law and other related matters for which we do not maintain insurance coverage 
we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  however  should we experience a significant increase in losses resulting from workers compensation  professional liability or employee health and welfare claims  the resulting increase in provisions and or required reserves could negatively affect our profitability 
an adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including collective and class action lawsuits alleging violations by us of the federal fair labor standards act and certain state wage and hour laws and putative shareholder class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging violations by us of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and may be subject to additional lawsuits in the future 
the damages claimed against us in such litigation are substantial 
a more detailed description of these lawsuits and others is contained in item  legal proceedings 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the pending cases 
in addition to the possibility of an adverse outcome  such litigation is costly to manage  investigate and defend  and the related defense costs  diversion of management s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations 
we may experience disruption to our business and operations from the effects of natural disasters or terrorist acts 
the occurrence of natural disasters  terrorist acts or mass illnesses such as the pandemic flu  and the erosion to our business caused by such an occurrence  may adversely impact our profitability 
in the affected areas  our offices may be forced to close for limited or extended periods of time  and we may face the reduced availability of clinical associates 
risks related to healthcare regulation federal or state healthcare reform laws could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in march  president obama signed into law the health care reform act 
this culmination of a year long legislative process will have a significant impact on the health care delivery system 
much of that impact  specifically as related to home health services and hospice services  is unknown 
the health care reform act  among other things  sets out a plan for a type of universal healthcare coverage 
a number of states  including california  colorado  connecticut  massachusetts  new york and pennsylvania  are also contemplating significant reform of their health insurance markets 
other states have mounted legal challenges to the implementation of certain aspects of the new federal law in their respective states 
the health care reform act  along with possible changes at the state level  will affect both public programs and privately financed health insurance arrangements 
both the federal law and the state proposals will increase the number of insured persons by expanding the eligibility levels for public programs and compelling individuals and employers to purchase health coverage 
at the same time  these laws seek to reform the underwriting and marketing practices of health plans 
these laws could further increase pricing pressure on existing commercial payers 
as a result  commercial payers may likely seek to lower their rates of reimbursement for the services we provide 
state proposals are still being debated in various legislatures and the legal challenges to the health care reform act are subject to various appeals 
the health care reform act mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under medicare 
for home health  the health care reform act mandates creation of a value based purchasing program  development of quality measures  a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal year that will be phased in over a four year period  and a reduction in the outlier cap 
in addition  the health care reform act requires the secretary of health and human services to test different models for delivery of care  some of which would involve home health services 
it also requires the secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions  bundling payment for acute hospital care  physician services  outpatient hospital services including emergency department services  and post acute care services  which would include home health 
the health care reform act further directs the secretary to rebase payments for home health  which will result in a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning in that will be phased in over a four year period 
the secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate cost and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness  and provide a report to congress no later than march  beginning october   the annual market basket rate increase for hospice providers will be reduced by a formula that could cause payment rates to be lower than in the prior year 
given the recent enactment of the health care reform act  and taking into account proposed state reforms and legal challenges  we cannot predict how our business will be affected by the full implementation of these and future actions 
the health care reform act  in connection with state initiatives  may increase our costs  decrease our revenues  expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business  any of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
legislative and regulatory actions resulting in changes in reimbursement rates or methods of payment from medicare and medicaid  or implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services  may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins 
reimbursement to us for our hospice services is subject to medicare cap amounts  which are calculated by medicare 
in and  percent and percent  respectively  of gentiva s total net revenues were generated from medicare  medicaid and local government programs 
the healthcare industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment  as the government seeks to stabilize or reduce reimbursement and utilization rates 
in addition  the timing of payments made under these programs is subject to regulatory action and governmental budgetary constraints 
for certain medicaid programs  the time period between submission of claims and payment has increased 
further  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are a substantial number of areas subject to administrative rulings and interpretations that may further affect payments made under those programs 
additionally  the federal and state governments may in the future reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of providers 
these pressures may be increased as a result of the health care reform act 
moreover  we cannot assure you that adjustments from regulatory actions or medicare or medicaid audits  including the payment of fines or penalties to the federal or state governments  will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or profitability 
overall payments made by medicare to us for hospice services are subject to cap amounts calculated by medicare 
total medicare payments to us for hospice services are compared to the cap amount for the hospice cap period  which runs from november of one year through october of the next year 
cms usually announces the cap amount in the month of july or august in the cap period and not at the beginning of the cap period 
we must estimate the cap amount for the cap period before cms announces the cap amount and are at risk if our estimate exceeds the later announced cap amount 
cms can also make retroactive adjustments to cap amounts announced for prior cap periods 
payments to us in excess of the cap amount must be returned by us to medicare 
in may  cms announced that the medicare cap would be  per beneficiary for the cap year  which is from november  through october  a second hospice cap amount limits the number of days of inpatient care to not more than percent of total patient care days within the cap period 
as part of its review of the medicare hospice benefit  medpac recommended to congress in its report to congress medicare payment policy march medpac report that congress direct the secretary of health and human services to change the medicare payment system for hospice to have relatively higher payments per day at the beginning of a patient s hospice care and relatively lower payments per day as the length of the duration of the hospice patient s stay increases  include relatively higher payments for the costs associated with patient death at the end of the hospice patient s stay  and implement the payment system changes in  with a brief transitional period 
in january  medpac reaffirmed the foregoing recommendations and recommended that the hospice rate should be increased by percent for fiscal in addition  the health care reform act includes several provisions that would adversely impact hospice providers  including a provision to reduce the annual market basket update for hospice providers by a productivity adjustment 
we cannot predict at this time whether the recommendations included in the medpac report will be enacted or whether any additional healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented or whether the health care reform act or other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system will adversely affect our revenues 
further  due to budgetary concerns  several states have considered or are considering reducing or eliminating the medicaid hospice benefit 
reductions or changes in medicare or medicaid funding could significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and our profitability 
on october   cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health payments for calendar year this is comprised of a net market basket update of percent  which includes the percent reduction mandated by the affordable care act  offset by a case mix creep adjustment of percent in the net effect of these changes decreases the base rate for an episode of service by percent 
in addition  the final rule states that the medicare home health rates for calendar year will include an additional negative percent change in case mix adjustment 
the final rule also shifts case mix points from high case mix and high therapy episodes to low case mix and non therapy episodes 
the shift from high therapy episodes and the removal of two hypertension codes may also have a negative impact on our revenues in in addition to the base rate decrease 
reductions in amounts paid by government programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause our net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline 
approximately percent of our hospice patients reside in nursing homes 
changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided our hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
for hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state medicaid programs who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice per diem rate  an amount equal to at least percent of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
we contract with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide medicaid nursing home patients 
we bill and collect from the applicable state medicaid program an amount equal to at least percent of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state s medicaid plan 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at percent of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate 
government studies conducted in the last several years have suggested that the reimbursement levels for hospice patients living in nursing homes may be excessive 
in particular  the federal government has expressed concern that hospice programs may provide fewer services to patients residing in nursing homes than to patients living in other settings due to the presence of the nursing home s own staff to address problems that might otherwise be handled by hospice personnel 
because hospice programs are paid a fixed per diem amount  regardless of the volume or duration of services provided  the government is concerned that hospice programs may be increasing their profitability by shifting the cost of certain patient care services to nursing homes 
the reduction or elimination of medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
in addition  changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect our ability to obtain referrals from nursing homes 
a reduction in referrals from nursing homes would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry  and changes in regulations and violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and  in some cases  local regulation 
compliance with these regulatory requirements  as interpreted and amended from time to time  can increase operating costs or reduce revenue and thereby adversely affect the financial viability of our business 
because these laws are amended from time to time and are subject to interpretation  we cannot predict when and to what extent liability may arise 
failure to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could also result in the imposition of various remedies  including fines  the revocation of licenses or decertification 
unanticipated increases in operating costs or reductions in revenue could adversely affect our liquidity 
the senate finance committee conducted an inquiry into certain of our practices  and the sec has commenced an investigation relating to our participation in the medicare home health prospective payment system 
in a letter dated may   the united states senate finance committee requested information from us regarding our medicare utilization rates and amount of therapy services furnished to each beneficiary 
the letter was sent to all of the publicly traded home healthcare companies mentioned in a wall street journal article that explored the relationship between cms home health policies and the utilization rates of some home health agencies 
as part of our initial production of documents  on may   the senate finance committee requested supplemental information relating to our compliance program  policies and procedures and billing manuals 
we responded to this request as well as to supplemental requests for information 
on october   the senate finance committee released its report on its inquiry into the home health therapy practices of publicly traded home healthcare companies 
the report was generally critical of certain practices of certain of the companies  including gentiva 
we maintain our belief that we have provided and are providing the highest quality of care and have received and continue to receive payment within the standards set forth by the reimbursement system established by cms 
we are unable to assess the probable outcome or potential liability  if any  arising from this matter on our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
we do not believe that an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss can be made for this matter at this time 
additionally  on july   the sec informed us that it had commenced an investigation relating to our participation in the medicare home health prospective payment system  and  on july   we received a subpoena from the sec requesting certain documents in connection with its investigation 
similar to the senate finance committee request  the sec subpoena  among other things  focused on issues related to the number of and reimbursement received for therapy visits before and after changes in the medicare reimbursement system  relationships with physicians  compliance efforts including compliance with fraud and abuse laws  and certain documents sent to the senate finance committee 
we responded to the sec s request 
we are unable to assess the probable outcome or potential liability  if any  arising from the matter 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience negative publicity with respect to these matters  that fines or other penalties will not be imposed by the sec or that an investigation by other governmental agencies may not be initiated for which we could incur fines or other losses as a result  including a reduction in reimbursement for certain services we perform 
if odyssey fails to comply with the terms of its corporate integrity agreement  it could subject us to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or termination from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
odyssey entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of inspector general of health and human services  which became effective on february   concurrent with the execution of a settlement agreement with the united states  acting through the doj and on behalf of the oig 
the cia imposes certain auditing  self reporting and training requirements that odyssey must comply with 
if odyssey fails to comply with the terms of its cia  it could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and or suspension or termination from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the imposition of monetary penalties would adversely affect odyssey s and our profitability 
a suspension or termination of its participation in the medicare and medicaid programs would have a material adverse affect on odyssey s and our profitability and financial condition as substantially all of odyssey s net patient service revenue is attributable to payments received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
if any of our home health or hospice programs fails to comply with the medicare conditions of participation  that program could be terminated from the medicare program  thereby adversely affecting our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our home health or hospice programs must comply with the extensive conditions of participation of the medicare benefit 
if any of our home health or hospice programs fails to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that program may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that home health or hospice program then fails to institute a plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that program could be terminated from receiving medicare payments 
for example  under the medicare hospice program  each of our hospice programs must demonstrate that volunteers provide administrative and direct patient care services in an amount equal to at least percent of the total patient care hours provided by its employees and contract staff at the hospice program 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of volunteers at one of our hospice programs to meet this requirement  that program could be terminated from the medicare benefit if the program fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period 
any termination of one or more of our home health or hospice programs from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the conditions of participation could adversely affect our patient service revenue and profitability and financial condition 
we believe that we are in compliance with the conditions of participation  however  we cannot predict how surveyors will interpret all aspects of the medicare conditions of participation 
we are subject to certain ongoing investigations  and we are subject to periodic audits and requests for information by the medicare and medicaid programs or government agencies  which have various rights and remedies against us if they assert that we have overcharged the programs or failed to comply with program requirements 
the operation of our home health services business and hospice services business is subject to federal and state laws prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including laws containing criminal provisions  which prohibit filing false claims or making false statements in order to receive payment or obtain certification under medicare and medicaid programs  or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
violation of these criminal provisions is a felony punishable by imprisonment and or fines 
we may also be subject to fines and treble damage claims if we violate the civil provisions that prohibit knowingly filing a false claim or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment 
state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the balanced budget act of and the health care reform act expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from medicare and medicaid programs and other federal and state health care programs 
additionally  the health care reform act requires providers  such as home health agencies and hospice providers  to notify the secretary of health and human services  fiscal intermediary  contractor or other appropriate person of any overpayment and the reason for the overpayment  and to return the overpayment  within the later of days from the time the overpayment is identified or the due date of the provider s cost report 
failure to comply may result in prosecution under the false claims act and exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
cms has contracted with various third party administrators tpas including recovery audit contractors racs  zone program integrity contractors zpics and others to perform post payment reviews of health care providers 
for example  in january  cms announced that it has approved two issues for the racs to begin reviewing with respect to hospice providers 
these initial hospice reviews focus on durable medical equipment services and other medicare part a and b services provided to hospice patients that are related to a patient s terminal prognosis and the financial obligation of the hospice provider to determine whether the hospice provider arranged for and paid for the services as required 
various states have also begun to engage tpas to conduct post payment reviews of medicaid claims data 
we expect in the future that cms and the states will likely expand the scope of the reviews conducted by the tpas 
we cannot predict whether reviews by tpas of our home health and hospice programs reimbursement claims will result in material recoupment s  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for a description of certain governmental investigations to which odyssey is currently subject  please see item  legal proceedings 
although we believe we have established policies and procedures that are sufficient to help ensure that we will operate in substantial compliance with anti fraud and abuse requirements  in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of laws  rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry could subject our current business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services and capital expenditure programs  increase our operating expenses and distract our management 
if we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations  we could become ineligible to receive government program payments  suffer civil and criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations 
we are also subject to federal and state laws that govern financial and other arrangements among healthcare providers 
federal law prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt  directly or indirectly  of remuneration to induce  arrange for  or in return for  the referral of federal health care program beneficiaries for items or services paid for by a federal health care program 
state laws also prohibit such payments for medicaid beneficiaries and some states have expanded anti kickback statutes 
the federal law known as the stark law prohibits certain financial arrangements with physicians 
state laws often prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical products and services 
furthermore  some states have enacted laws similar to the stark law  which restrict certain business relationships between physicians and other providers of healthcare services 
many states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as a provider of  medical care 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs  civil and criminal penalties  and exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
we face additional federal requirements and their additional costs that mandate major changes in the transmission and retention of health information and in notification requirements for any health information security breaches 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa was enacted to ensure that employees can retain and at times transfer their health insurance when they change jobs and to simplify healthcare administrative processes 
the enactment of hipaa also expanded protection of the privacy and security of personal medical data and required the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information 
among the standards that the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs has adopted pursuant to hipaa are standards for electronic transactions and code sets  unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  security and electronic signatures  privacy and enforcement 
although hipaa was intended to ultimately reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the healthcare industry  we believe that implementation of this law has resulted in additional costs 
failure to comply with hipaa could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act  enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  effective february   sets forth health information security breach notification requirements and increased penalties for violation of hipaa 
the hitech act requires patient notification for all breaches  media notification of breaches of over patients and at least annual reporting of all breaches to the secretary of hhs 
penalties under the hitech act range from per violation and an annual maximum of  for the first tier of sanctions to a fourth tier sanction minimum of  per violation and an annual maximum of million for the identical violation 
failure to comply with hipaa could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us

this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview gentiva health services  inc gentiva or the company is a leading provider of home health services and hospice services serving patients through approximately locations in states 
the company provides a single source for skilled nursing  physical  occupational  speech and neurorehabilitation services  hospice services  social work  nutrition  disease management education  help with daily living activities  and other therapies and services 
gentiva s revenues are generated from federal and state government programs  commercial insurance and individual consumers 
the federal and state government programs under which the company generates a majority of its net revenues are subject to legislative and other risk factors that can make it difficult to determine future reimbursement rates for gentiva s services to its patients 
in march  president obama signed into law the affordable care act which represents a billion reduction in medicare home health spending over an extended period 
the law phases in the reductions over seven years  including rebasing of medicare reimbursement rates over a four year period beginning in  with reductions resulting from rebasing not to exceed percent in any one year 
the company anticipates that many of the provisions of the affordable care act may be subject to further clarification and modification through the rule making process 
in addition  on october   cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year  as further discussed in the liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commercial insurance industry is continually seeking ways to control the cost of services to patients that it covers 
one of the ways it seeks to control costs is to require greater efficiencies from its providers  including home healthcare companies 
various states have addressed budget pressures by considering or implementing reductions in various healthcare programs  including reductions in rates or changes in patient eligibility requirements 
the company has also decided to reduce participation in certain medicaid and other state and county programs 
the company believes that several marketplace factors can contribute to its future growth

recent accounting pronouncements on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic asu  which provides final guidance on goodwill impairment that gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may allow them to skip the annual two step test and reduce costs 
asu gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step test 
otherwise  a company can skip the two step test 
the asu is effective for the year beginning january  for the company 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities  which requires health care organizations that do not assess the collectibility of a receivable before recognizing revenue to present their provision for bad debt related to patient service revenue as a deduction from revenue on the face of the statement of operations 
enhanced disclosure about policies for recognizing revenue  assessing bad debts and qualitative and quantitative information about changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts also are required 
the guidance is effective for the first quarter of for the company 
the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as the company currently evaluates the collectibility of a receivable before recognizing revenue 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
asu requires that all items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu will be required for the quarter ending on or after march  and must be applied retrospectively 
although the presentation of financial statements will change  the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu primarily clarifies existing concepts in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
however  asu requires new disclosures for level fair value measurements including quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs  the valuation process in place for all level measurements  and a narrative description of the sensitivity of recurring level fair value measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs used 
in addition  asu requires disclosure of transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy  the hierarchy classification for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the footnotes  and  if applicable  the reason nonfinancial assets measured at fair value are being used in a manner that differs from their highest and best use 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that the general level of inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during the past three years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  which incorporates the impact of various revenue adjustments including payment caps under the medicare program for hospice  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  obligations under insurance programs  including workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability and employee health and welfare insurance programs 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues recognized by the company are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related accounts receivable 
in each category described below  the impact of the estimate  if applicable  undertaken by the company with respect to these elements is reflected in net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
see further discussion of the elements below under the heading causes and impact of change on revenue 
in addition  these elements can be impacted by the risk factors described in risks related to our business and industry and risks related to healthcare regulation  which appear in part i  item a of this report 
home health episodic net revenues under the home health prospective payment system pps of reimbursement  for medicare and medicare advantage programs paid at episodic rates  the company estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data  relating to each patient s health status including clinical condition  functional abilities and service needs  as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels of employees providing services to the patient 
billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recorded is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the differences  if any  between the clinical assessment of and the therapy service needs for each patient at the time of certification as compared to actual experience and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  are discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million primarily relating to the pps program was included under current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively 
hospice medicare net revenues medicare revenues for hospice are recorded on an accrual basis based on the number of days a patient has been on service at amounts equal to an estimated payment rate 
the payment rate is dependent on whether a patient is receiving routine home care  general inpatient care  continuous home care or respite care 
adjustments to medicare revenues are recorded based on an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payer or other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
in addition  each hospice provider is subject to certain medicare payment limitations  including an overall payment cap 
the payment cap  which is calculated for each provider by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period  is determined by multiplying the number of first time patient admissions during the cap period by the medicare cap amount  subject to certain adjustments 
medicare revenue paid to a provider during a twelve month period ending october st cannot exceed the aggregate medicare payment cap 
as of december   the company currently has programs estimated to exceed the medicare cap limits for the cap year 
the company has recorded approximately million and million for estimated cap exposure as a reduction in medicare revenues in the company s consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year and  respectively 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  is reflected as medicare liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet associated with medicare cap exposures 
fee for service agreements under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain state and local government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered

medicare settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year were sufficient at december   it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this report  except as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
causes and impact of change on revenue for each of the sources of revenue  the principal elements in addition to those described above which can cause change in the amount of revenue to be realized are i an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation  ii an inability to obtain authorizations acceptable to the payer  iii utilization of services at levels other than authorized and iv other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments resulting from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts are recorded as adjustments to net revenues or recorded against allowance for doubtful accounts  depending on the nature of the adjustment 
these are determined by company management and reviewed from time to time  but no less often than quarterly 
each of the elements described here and under each of the various sources of revenue can effect change in the estimates 
although it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described  the company believes that changes in these elements could cause a change in estimate which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
there have not been any material revisions in these estimates for the periods presented in this report

collection processes are performed in accordance with the fair debt collections practices act and include reviewing aging and cash posting reports  contacting the payers to determine why payment has not been made  resubmission of claims when appropriate and filing appeals with payers for claims that have been denied

the company allocates goodwill to its various operating units 
the company compares the fair value of each operating unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the operating unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill 
to determine the fair value of the company s operating units  the company uses a present value discounted cash flow technique corroborated by market multiples when available  or other valuation methodologies  as appropriate 
the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized

the triggering event was the change in business climate  including uncertainties around medicare reimbursement as the federal government works to reduce the federal deficit 
the impairment assessment was completed as of august  the interim test concluded that the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets  as well as goodwill  was less than their carrying value as of that date 
the company utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine fair values 
the company then determined the implied fair value of goodwill by determining the fair value of all assets and liabilities 
as a result of this process  the company recorded a non cash charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of certain identifiable intangible assets  as well as goodwill  to their estimated fair values

the company based its fair value estimate of these businesses on market valuations received from potential buyers as the company had a more likely than not expectation that those businesses would be sold 
the impairment test indicated that the fair value of those operating units  less costs to sell  were lower than the carrying value and  as such  the company recorded a write down of goodwill of approximately million in discontinued operations in the company also completed its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for the company s operating units as of december  which indicated that there was no additional impairment for the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for the company s other operating units was performed and the results indicated that there was no impairment for or obligations under insurance programs the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability  and employee health and welfare

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
the interest rate on the company s borrowings under the credit agreement can fluctuate based on both the interest rate option ie  base rate or eurodollar rate plus applicable margins and the interest period 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates as of that date would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a similar capital structure
