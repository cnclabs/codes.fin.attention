this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of for a discussion of indicators of forward looking statements and specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements  see risk factors under part i item a of this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section should be read and interpreted in light of such factors 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
you may have difficulty evaluating our business  because we acquired apthera only in the past year and are undertaking to partially spin off rxi 
there is no assurance  however  that the partial spin off will be completed 
following the partial spin off  assuming it is completed  our financial statements will no longer reflect the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rxi  and we will account for our partial ownership of rxi based on the equity method of accounting 
for these reasons  the historical consolidated financial information included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows that we will achieve in the future 

table of contents background on the company and recent change in strategic focus we were formed in by cytrx corporation cytrx and four prominent rnai researchers 
we commenced operations in january  after cytrx contributed to us its portfolio of rnai therapeutic assets consisting primarily of rnai licenses and related intellectual property and a nominal amount of equipment 
we acquired apthera and our neuvax product candidate in april prior to that time  we were engaged primarily in conducting discovery research and preclinical development activities based on rnai 
our acquisition of apthera followed from the determination by our board of directors to broaden our strategic direction by giving us access to a late stage clinical candidate  neuvax 
in connection with our acquisition of apthera  we reduced the scope of our rnai activities to focus primarily on rxi  our lead rnai product  while maintaining our key development alliances and core rnai discovery and development capability 
following the apthera acquisition  our board of directors undertook to explore strategic alternatives for our rnai platform that would enable us to commit more resources to our later stage oncology drug programs 
on february  we announced  as required by nasdaq listing rule e  that our board of directors had declared a conditional dividend on galena common stock of one share of common stock of rxi for each outstanding share of galena common stock 
the spin off shares will be payable  subject to certain conditions described below  to our stockholders as of close of business eastern time on march   the record date for the distribution  in the ratio of one rxi share for each share of galena common stock held as of the record date 
in light of the conditional nature of the partial spin off of rxi  our board of directors has not set a payment date for the distribution  and under nasdaq rules our common stock is not yet trading ex dividend 
the distribution of the spin off shares will be taxable to galena stockholders who receive rxi shares in the distribution 
the distribution to galena stockholders of the spin off shares is to be made pursuant to the registration statement filed by rxi with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on february  because the rxi registration statement will go stale on april   we must complete the distribution of the spin off shares by that date  unless we were to cause rxi to amend the registration statement 
it is likely that we would abandon the partial spin off of rxi if the distribution of the spin off shares has not been made by april   although our board of directors has not made any decision in this regard 
the establishment of a payment date for the distribution and the payment of the distribution is dependent upon the timing of effectiveness of an application filed with finra to permit rxi common stock to be traded in the otc markets group under the symbol rxii 
the payment of the distribution also is conditioned upon the closing of the rxi financing  which is subject to certain closing conditions that may or may not be satisfied 
in addition  the securities purchase agreement among galena  rxi and the rxi investors provides that the agreement may be unilaterally terminated by us or by the rxi investors if the closing of the transactions has not occurred by march   and it is not possible for the closing to occur by this date 
accordingly  unless this date is extended by mutual agreement of the rxi investors and us  either we or the rxi investors generally may terminate the securities purchase agreement at any time after march   unless the failure of the closing to occur was due to the fault of the party seeking to terminate the securities purchase agreement 
although we have no present intention to terminate the securities purchase agreement or to abandon the partial spin off of rxi  the rxi investors may choose to do so 
we also may decide to do so at any time if our board of directors determines that it is in the best interests of our company 
for all of the foregoing reasons  there is no assurance that the payment and distribution of the spin off shares will be completed 
if the closing of the transactions under the securities purchase agreement has not occurred by the march  maturity date of the rxi convertible notes  unless such date is extended by mutual agreement by the rxi investors and us  the permanent financing and the partial spin off of rxi may not occur  and one half of the outstanding principal of and accrued interest on the rxi convertible notes held by the investors will be converted into shares of rxi common stock equal to of the shares of outstanding common stock of rxi immediately upon such conversion 
rxi will be obliged to repay the balance of the principal of and accrued interest on the rxi convertible notes held by the investors  and we have agreed in the securities purchase agreement to guarantee rxi s repayment of the rxi convertible notes to the extent they are not converted 
in this event  we will own of the outstanding shares of rxi common stock  and rxi will carry on as a stand alone private company 
table of contents under the investors control  with its own management and with whatever funding and other financial resources that may be available to it 
neither the investors in rxi nor galena will be obliged to provide any funding to rxi in this event  and there is no guarantee that funding will be available to rxi on acceptable terms  or at all 
if rxi fails to obtain additional funding in this event  it would be forced to scale back or terminate its operations  or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company 
we are in discussions with the rxi investors to extend the current march  maturity date of the rxi convertible notes  but there is no assurance that the maturity date will be extended 
research and development our research and development programs are focused on developing cancer therapies utilizing peptide based immunotherapy products  including our main product candidate neuvax  for the treatment of various cancers 
since we commenced operations  research and development has comprised a significant proportion of our total operating expenses and is expected to comprise the majority of our spending for the foreseeable future 
there are risks in any new field of drug discovery that preclude certainty regarding the successful development of a product 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any product candidate 
our inability to make these estimates results from the uncertainty of numerous factors  including but not limited to our ability to advance product candidates into preclinical research and clinical trials  the scope and rate of progress of our preclinical program and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the effect of government regulation and insurance industry efforts to control healthcare costs through reimbursement policy and other cost management strategies 
failure to complete any stage of the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
license agreements we have entered into licensing relationships with academic institutions  research foundations and commercial entities  and may seek to enter into additional licenses with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we also may enter into strategic alliances to expand our intellectual property portfolio and to potentially accelerate our development programs by gaining access to technology and funding  including equity sales  license fees and other revenues 
for each product that we develop that is covered by the patents licensed to us including our material licenses discussed elsewhere in this annual report  we are obligated to make additional payments upon the attainment of certain specified product development milestones 
see business intellectual property under part i item of this annual report for information on our material license agreements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates  allocations and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience and on other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  the financial information included here may not necessarily reflect the financial position  operating results  changes in our invested equity and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
included in research and development costs are wages  benefits and other operating costs  facilities  supplies  external services and overhead related to our research and development departments as well as costs to acquire technology licenses and expenses associated with preparation of clinical trials 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants  including employee stock options 
stock compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
for stock options granted as consideration for services rendered by non employees  we recognize compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc topic asc  equity based payments to non employees 
non employee option grants that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the vesting period of the underlying stock options 
at the end of each financial reporting period prior to vesting  the value of these options  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  will be re measured using the fair value of our common stock and the non cash compensation recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly 
since the fair market value of options granted to non employees is subject to change in the future  the amount of the future compensation expense will include fair value re measurements until the stock options are fully vested 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  with the following weighted average assumptions weighted average risk free interest rate weighted average volatility expected lives years expected dividend yield the company s expected common stock price volatility assumption is based upon the volatility of a basket of companies that we consider comparable to us 
the expected life assumptions for employee grants were based upon the simplified method provided for under asc  which averages the contractual term of the options 
table of contents of ten years with the average vesting term of four years for an average of six years 
the expected life assumptions for non employees were based upon the contractual term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption of zero is based upon the fact that the company has never paid cash dividends and presently has no intention of paying cash dividends in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant was also based upon prevailing short term interest rates 
the company has an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of for options granted to employees  and for options granted to senior management and no forfeiture rate for the directors 
the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture rates are higher than estimated 
derivative financial instruments during the normal course of business  from time to time  we issue warrants and options to vendors as consideration to perform services 
we may also issue warrants as part of a debt or equity financing 
we do not enter into any derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
we recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair value with changes in fair value of derivatives reflected as current period income or loss unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for as such 
during the years ended december  and  we issued warrants to purchase  and  shares of common stock  respectively  in connection with an equity transaction 
in accordance with asc topic  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own stock asc  the value of these warrants is required to be recorded as a liability  as the holders have an option to put the warrants back to us in certain events  as defined 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we record intangible assets acquired at fair value 
our intangible assets consist primarily of acquired in process research and development 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing the fair value methodology 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an interim review for impairment include  but are not limited to  the following significant changes in the manner of its use of acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit the first step 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment the second step 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
in its review of the carrying value of the goodwill  the company determines fair values of its intangible assets using the income approach  or more specifically the discounted cash flow method 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
long lived assets  held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be entirely recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over 
table of contents their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination was made 
any resulting impairment losses recorded by the company could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by either decreasing net income or increasing net loss 
in connection with its annual impairment test  the company performed its review for impairment 
based upon the valuation approach described above  the company determined that the current carrying value of its goodwill had not been impaired 
goodwill amounted to million and as of december  and  respectively 
there was no amortization of goodwill for the years ended and other intangible assets amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
there was no amortization of other intangible assets for the years ended and purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
some of the items  including property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves require a degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
management finalizes the purchase price allocation within months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
acquired in process research and development in  we recorded million of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of apthera 
the projects acquired in the acquisition consisted primarily of the clinical development related to its clinical oncology program  primarily the neuvax compound for breast cancer patients 
we purchased this with the intent of clinically developing the neuvax compound for market approval 
at the date we acquired the neuvax compound  the program was in the midst of a phase clinical trial 
in order to commercialize this drug  the company will need to complete at least one phase clinical trial 
on january   we initiated our phase present trial for neuvax e peptide plus gm csf vaccine in low to intermediate her and breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrence clinicaltrials 
gov identifier nct 
the cost of this phase clinical trial is expected to exceed million to reach its primary endpoint 
we do not expect to commence commercialization of neuvax prior to  if at all 
valuation of contingent earnout consideration acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain future financial performance measures of the acquired company 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
we evaluate  on a routine  periodic basis  the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value  subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition  are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of expenses 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates  changes in the timing of development milestones achieved and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria 
any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material impact on our operating results 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   our net loss was approximately  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the variation in the net loss between the years are discussed below 
revenue since we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company  we have not generated any revenue since inception through december  research and development expense in thousands for the years ended december  research and development expense research and development employee stock based compensation expense research and development non employee stock based compensation expense total research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of compensation related costs for our employees dedicated to research and development activities and for clinical trial related costs  licensing fees  patent prosecution costs  and the cost of lab supplies used in our research and development programs 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development programs 
as a result of the costs expected to be incurred in connection with our recently commenced clinical trials of neuvax and fbp  we expect that our research and development expense will increase significantly from historic levels for the foreseeable future 
total research and development expenses for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was due to an increase of  in research and development cash expenses related to preparation for our phase present clinical trial of neuvax  which was partially offset by a decrease of  in employee stock based compensation and a  decrease in non employee stock based compensation expense 
research and development non employee stock based compensation expense we issued options to purchase shares of our common stock as compensation to our scientific advisory board sab members and consultants 
for financial statement purposes  we valued these shares at their fair value 
fluctuations in non employee stock based compensation expense results from variations in the number of common stock options issued  vesting schedules and the black scholes fair values of common stock options granted to sab members 
general and administrative expense in thousands for the years ended december  general and administrative expense common stock warrants issued for general and administrative expense fair value of common stock issued in exchange for general and administrative expense common stock and stock options issued for general and administrative expense total general and administrative expense 
table of contents general and administrative expense includes compensation related costs for our employees dedicated to general and administrative activities  legal fees  audit and tax fees  consultants and professional services  and general corporate expenses 
total general and administrative expense was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase of  in general and administrative expense related to an increase in legal  audit and other professional services  and an increase of  for non cash share based compensation expense issued in exchange for services  which increases were partially offset by a decrease of  from warrants issued for business advisory services and  in non cash share based compensation expense 
from time to time  we expect to issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we will value these shares of common stock  common stock options  and warrants at their fair value 
interest income interest income was negligible for both the year ended december   and december  the key objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal and ensure sufficient liquidity  so our invested cash may not earn as high a level of income as longer term or higher risk securities  which generally have less liquidity and more volatility 
the interest rates available on lower risk  shorter term investments in today s market are lower than rates available in the prior period 
we expect to have interest income in future periods based on our current account balances and potentially from additional capital we may receive in the future 
other income other income expense is summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  interest income  net loss on warrant exchange change in fair value of common stock warrants issued reduction of potential redemption liability change in contingent purchase liability other income other income  net other income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall increase of  or  was due to an increase of  attributable to the change in fair value of common stock warrants outstanding  which was partially offset by  due to the loss on warrant exchange  a decrease of  attributed to a decrease of potential redemption liability and a decrease of  in other income  representing primarily a decrease in grant income 
income taxes there was no income tax expense for the years ended december  and due to the fact that we have incurred significant tax losses since we began operations 
a deferred tax benefit would have been recorded for losses  however  due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit  a valuation allowance was recognized which fully offset the deferred tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of march  
table of contents we have not generated revenue to date and may not generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if ever 
we expect to incur significant operating losses as we advance our product candidates through the drug development and regulatory process 
as a result of the increased research and development expense expected to be incurred in connection with our recently commenced clinical trials of neuvax and fbp  we expect that our expenses will increase significantly from historic levels for the foreseeable future 
in addition to increasing research and development expense  we expect general and administrative costs to increase as we conduct future clinical trials 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and might never do so 
in the absence of product revenue  our potential sources of operational funding are expected to be the proceeds from the sale of equity  funded research and development payments and payments received under partnership and collaborative agreements 
on february   we entered into a controlled equity offering sm sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co 
cantor  pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time through cantor  acting as agent  shares of our common stock  par value per share  having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
the offer and sale of our shares through cantor will be registered pursuant to our registration statement on form s file no 
declared effective by the sec on may  and is described in detail in the related prospectus supplement dated february  filed with the sec and the prospectus dated may  included as part of our registration statement 
the offering pursuant to the sales agreement will terminate upon the sale of all shares subject to the sales agreement or the earlier termination of the sales agreement as permitted therein 
there is no assurance that additional funding will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
under the sales agreement  cantor may sell shares of our common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule of the sec securities act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  sales made directly on the nasdaq capital market  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker 
cantor may also sell our shares under the sales agreement by any other method permitted by law  including in privately negotiated transactions 
cantor has agreed in the sales agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares in accordance with our instructions including any price  time or size limit or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and the proceeds from the sales agreement should be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the first quarter of net cash flow from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared with  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  the increase of approximately  resulted from a net loss of  less non cash items of  of which  related to stock based compensation   related to stock warrant expense in exchange for services   related to a loss on equity instruments   related to depreciation   related to a decrease in the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration   that reflects the fair value of warrants and mandatorily redeemable stock obligations issued with financings completed by the company and  related to changes in current assets and liabilities 
net cash flow from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared with net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase of approximately  in cash provided by investing activities was due to  change in restricted cash   of cash received in connection with our acquisition and a decrease of  in cash paid for equipment 
net cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  this increase of approximately  was primarily due to not purchasing any treasury shares in compared with the purchase of

this update requires a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period 
the disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period 
if comparative financial statements are presented  the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
this update affects any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis and is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  all disclosures are presented in accordance with the acquisition of apthera  inc recently adopted accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards updated asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  a new accounting standard that clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this new standard is effective on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december  the company does not expect that adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  a new accounting standard that eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  requires the consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income and requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income 
the amendments in this new standard do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income nor do the amendments affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this new standard is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  as this new standard only requires enhanced disclosure  the adoption of this standard will not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  a new accounting standard to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previous guidance under topic required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however
