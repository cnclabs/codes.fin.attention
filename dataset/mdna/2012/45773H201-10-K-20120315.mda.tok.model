overview we are engaged in the discovery  development  and delivery of a new generation of vaccines  called synthetic vaccines  focused on cancers and infectious diseases 
our syncon technology enables the design of universal vaccines capable of providing cross protection against new  unmatched strains of pathogens such as influenza 
our electroporation dna delivery technology uses brief  controlled electrical pulses to increase cellular dna vaccine uptake 
initial human data has shown this method can safely and significantly increase gene expression and immune responses 
our clinical programs include hpv cervical cancer therapeutic  avian influenza preventive  prostate cancer therapeutic  leukemia therapeutic  hcv and hiv vaccines 
we are advancing preclinical research for a universal seasonal pandemic influenza vaccine as well as other products 
our partners and collaborators include university of pennsylvania  drexel university  national microbiology laboratory of the public health agency of canada  program for appropriate technology in health malaria vaccine initiative path or mvi  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  merck  chrontech  university of southampton  united states military hiv research program usmhrp  us army medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid  hiv vaccines trial network hvtn and department of homeland security dhs 

table of contents all of our potential human products are in research and development phases 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of any such products  and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years 
we earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue  collaborative research and development agreements  grants and government contracts 
our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
all product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use  and will require significant costs for commercialization 
we may not be successful in our research and development efforts  and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable 
on june   we completed the merger resulting in our acquisition of vgx 
we believe the merger advances our ability to play a leadership role in the discovery  development  and delivery of synthetic vaccines 
on may   we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name from inovio biomedical corporation to inovio pharmaceuticals  inc recent developments on december   we completed an underwritten public offering relating to the sale and issuance of  units to certain institutional investors  consisting of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  additional shares of common stock 
these units include the partial exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option of  additional units at the public offering price 
the units consist of one share of common stock and of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price of per share 
we may call the warrants if the closing bid price of our common stock has been at least over trading days and certain other conditions are met 
we received net proceeds from the transaction of approximately million  after deducting the underwriter s discounts and other offering expenses payable 
on october   we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement the agreement with vgx int l 
under the agreement  we will co develop with vgx int l our syncon therapeutic vaccines for hepatitis b and c infections the products 
under the terms of the agreement  vgx int l will receive marketing rights for the products in asia  excluding japan  and in return will fully fund ind enabling and initial phase i and ii clinical studies with respect to the products 
we will receive from vgx int l payments based on the achievement of clinical milestones and royalties based on sales of the products in the licensed territories  retaining all commercial rights to the products in all other territories 
on september   we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement crada with the united states department of homeland security dhs science and technology directorate plum island animal disease center 
this collaboration will evaluate the efficacy of our syncon vaccines for foot mouth disease fmd in important animal models including cattle  sheep  and pigs 
on january   we entered into investor purchase agreements with investors relating to the issuance and sale of a  shares of common stock  and b warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units  consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants have a five year term from the date of issuance and are first exercisable commencing on the th day after the date of issuance 
we may call the warrants if the closing bid price of the common stock has been at least over trading days and certain other conditions are met 
we received net proceeds from the transaction of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent s fee and other offering expenses 
on march   we entered into our agreement with vgx int l 
under the vgx int l agreement  we granted vgx int l an exclusive license to the product  ie  our syncon universal influenza vaccine delivered with electroporation to be developed in certain countries in asia 
as consideration for the license granted to 
table of contents vgx int l  we have received payment of million as a research and development initiation fee  and will receive research support  annual license maintenance fees and royalties on net product sales 
in addition  contingent upon achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones  we will receive development payments over the term of the vgx int l agreement 
the vgx int l agreement also provides us with exclusive rights to supply devices for clinical and commercial purposes including single use components to vgx int l for use in the product 
the term of the vgx int l agreement commenced upon execution and will extend on a country by country basis until the last to expire of all royalty periods for the territory as such term is defined in the vgx int l agreement for any product in that country  unless the vgx int l agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions as a result of breach  by mutual agreement  or by vgx int l s right to terminate without cause upon prior written notice 
in january  we announced that we expanded our existing license agreement with the university of pennsylvania  adding exclusive worldwide licenses for technology and intellectual property for novel dna vaccines against pandemic influenza  chikungunya  and foot and mouth disease 
the amendment also encompasses new chemokine and cytokine molecular adjuvant technologies 
the technology was developed in the university of pennsylvania laboratory of professor david b 
weiner  a pioneer in the field of dna vaccines  and chairman of our scientific advisory board 
under the terms of the original license agreement completed in  we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop multiple dna plasmids and constructs with the potential to treat and or prevent hiv  hcv  hpv and influenza and included molecular adjuvants 
these prior and most recent agreements and amendments provide for royalty payments  based on future sales  to the university of pennsylvania 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future due to our commitment to our research and development programs  the funding of preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory activities and the costs of general and administrative activities 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  other than the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements discussed below 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition 
grant revenue we receive non refundable grants under available government programs 
government grants towards current expenditures are recorded as revenue when there is reasonable assurance that we have complied with all conditions necessary to receive the grants  collectability is reasonably assured  and as the expenditures are incurred 

table of contents license fee and milestone revenue we have adopted a strategy of co developing or licensing our gene delivery technology for specific genes or specific medical indications 
accordingly  we have entered into collaborative research and development agreements and have received funding for pre clinical research and clinical trials 
prior to the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we recorded payments under these agreements  which are non refundable  as revenue as the related research expenditures were incurred pursuant to the terms of the agreements and provided collectability was reasonably assured 
for new collaborative agreements or material modifications of existing collaborative agreements entered into after december   we follow the provisions of asu no 
in order to account for the multiple element arrangements  we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separable units of accounting 
analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment  and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver services  a right or license to use an asset  or another performance obligation 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
upfront license fee payments are recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered items  the relative selling price allocation of the license is equal to or exceeds the upfront license fee  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the collaborator is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
upfront license fee payments are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic milestone method of revenue recognition milestone method  we recognized non refundable milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones upon which we had earned the milestone payment  provided the milestone payment was substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
we deferred payments for milestone events that were reasonably assured and recognized them ratably over the minimum remaining period of our performance obligations 
payments for milestones that were not reasonably assured were treated as the culmination of a separate earnings process and were recognized as revenue when the milestones were achieved 
effective january   we adopted on a prospective basis the milestone method of asu no 
under the milestone method  we will recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  
table of contents the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the company 
research and development expenses 
since our inception  virtually all of our activities have consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our electroporation technologies and dna vaccines 
research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
valuation and impairment evaluations of goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
as of december   our intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of vgx and inovio as  and additional intangibles including previously capitalized patent costs and license costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we are concurrently conducting pre clinical  phase i  and phase ii trials using acquired intangibles  and we have entered into certain significant licensing agreements for use of these acquired intangibles 
historically we have recorded patents at cost and amortized these costs using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the patents or years  whichever is less 
patent costs consist of the consideration paid for patents and related legal costs 
effective june   in connection with our acquisition of vgx  all new patent costs are being expensed as incurred 
patent costs currently capitalized will continue to be amortized over the expected life of the patent 
the effect of this change was immaterial to prior periods 
we record license costs based on the fair value of consideration paid and amortize using the straight line method over the shorter of the expected useful life of the underlying patents or the term of the related license agreement 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if impairment is indicated  we reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to fair value 
while our current and historical operating and cash flow losses are potential indicators of impairment  we believe the future cash flows to be received from our intangible assets will exceed the intangible assets carrying value  and accordingly  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
our accounting policy with respect to reviewing goodwill for impairment is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value including allocated goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss  if any 
we test goodwill for impairment at the entity level  which is considered our reporting unit 
our estimate of fair value is determined using both the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach 
the discounted cash flow method estimates future cash flows of our business for a certain discrete period and then discounts them to their present value 
the guideline public company method computes value indicators multiples from the operating data of the selected publicly traded guideline companies 
after these multiples were evaluated  
table of contents appropriate value indicators were selected and applied to the operating statistics of the reporting unit to arrive at indications of value 
specifically  we relied upon the application of total invested capital based valuation multiples for each guideline company 
in applying the income and market approaches  premiums and discounts were determined and applied to estimate the fair values of the reporting unit 
to arrive at the indicated value of equity under each approach  we then assigned a relative weighting to the resulting values from each approach to determine whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  thus requiring step two of the impairment test 
we conduct the impairment test annually on november th for each fiscal year for which goodwill is evaluated for impairment 
we are also aware of the requirement to evaluate goodwill for impairment at other times should circumstances arise 
to date  we have concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore  step two of the impairment test has never been performed 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we have equity incentive plans under which we have granted incentive stock options  restricted stock units and non qualified stock options 
our employee stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value stock option awards 
we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
our non employee stock based compensation awards are measured at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured at each reporting date using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is completed 
registered common stock warrants 
we account for registered common stock warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify registered warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the registered warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in fair value of common stock warrants 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the audited consolidated financial data for the years ended december  and december  is presented in the following table and the results of these two periods are used in the discussion thereafter

our total revenue increased million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to increases in grants and miscellaneous revenue 
the  increase in license fee and milestone revenue for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to higher revenues recognized from the vgx int l agreement entered into in march and various smaller license agreements

these increases were also attributable to higher revenue recognized under our path malaria vaccine initiative mvi contract of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in path is an international nonprofit organization funded by private donors 
we have a research program and agreement with the path mvi to evaluate in a preclinical feasibility study our syncon dna vaccine development platform to target antigens from plasmodium species and deliver them intradermally using the cellectra electroporation device 
the initial agreement with mvi was for  and was completed in february in september we entered into an amended agreement with path to further this study in non human primates 
the amended agreement had a total value of  and was completed in august the overall increase in grants and miscellaneous revenue was also due to higher revenue recognized from our subcontract with drexel university of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  and higher revenues recognized from our subcontract with the university of pennsylvania of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by no revenue recognized in related to the grant awarded in october under the patient protection and affordable care act of ppaca for  this grant was related to three of our projects  including the phase ii clinical trial of vgx  a therapeutic vaccine for cervical dysplasia and cancer as well as development projects for syncon universal flu and dengue vaccines 
the ppaca provided small and mid sized biotech  pharmaceutical and medical device companies with up to a tax credit for investments in qualified therapeutic discoveries for tax years and  or a grant for the same amount tax free 
in addition  there was no revenue recognized from the department of defense us army grant during the year ended december  when compared to  recognized in the us army grant  which commenced in  had a total value of  and was completed in may this project funded research and development of dna based vaccines delivered via our proprietary electroporation system and focused on identifying dna vaccine candidates with the potential to provide rapid  robust immunity to protect against bio warfare and bioterror attacks 
research and development expenses the million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to million in higher clinical trial costs including the initiation of the hpv phase ii and influenza phase i study  million in higher compensation and related expenses due to increased employee headcount  higher outside service expense of  for various on going research efforts  higher employee stock based compensation of  due to an increase in total options granted during the year  higher facilities and it expense of  higher expensed inventory of  for the increased purchases of devices to support on going clinical trials  as well as higher travel and transportation expenses of  these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in consulting expense related to our us army grant and other services  among other variances 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include business development expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the  decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and related expenses  accounting and audit expenses  and other outside services of   and  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by higher severance expenses  higher employee stock based compensation due to an increase in total options granted during the year and severance related stock option expenses  as well as higher consulting expenses related to corporate management and investor relations of   and  respectively  among other variances 
stock based compensation employee stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award reduced by estimated forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period

change in fair value of common stock warrants the change in fair value of common stock warrants for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the revaluation of registered common stock warrants issued by us in july and january we revalue warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value 
if unexercised  the warrants will expire at various dates between august and december loss on investment in affiliated entity the loss is a result of the change in the fair market value of the investment in vgx int l for the year ended december  income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal  california and pennsylvania income tax purposes of approximately million  million and million  respectively  net of the net operating losses that will expire due to irc section limitations

our total revenue decreased million or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to decreases in license fees and revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements offset by an increase in grants and miscellaneous revenue 
the million decrease in license fees and milestone payments for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to no revenues recognized in under the wyeth collaboration and licensing agreement 
in we accelerated and recognized million of deferred revenue due to the cancellation of the wyeth agreement in july the decrease was also attributable to less revenue recognized from other smaller license agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by revenues recognized in from the vgx int l collaboration and license agreement 
the  decrease in revenue under collaborative research and development arrangements during the year ended december  as compared to was due to no revenues recognized under our research and collaboration agreement with merck  as we have provided the majority of the required device development for use in their clinical trials 
we believe that development activities will be limited until trial results are obtained 
the million increase in grant and miscellaneous revenue for the year ended december  as compared to  was primarily due to higher revenues recognized from our contract with the niaid of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the niaid contract  which was modified in september  has an initial term of five years with two one year options period of

the current approved funding of the contract for the five years is million with option years six and seven valued at million and million  respectively  for a total potential value of million  and will fund research and development for hiv dna based vaccines delivered via our proprietary electroporation system 
the increase is also attributed to the  grant awarded in october under the patient protection and affordable care act of ppaca 
the grant was related to three of our projects  including the phase ii clinical trial of vgx  a therapeutic vaccine for cervical dysplasia and cancer as well as development projects for syncon universal flu and dengue vaccines 
the ppaca provides small and mid sized biotech  pharmaceutical and medical device companies with up to a tax credit for investments in qualified therapeutic discoveries for tax years and  or a grant for the same amount tax free 
these increases were partially offset by less revenue recognized under our path malaria vaccine initiative mvi contract and from the department of defense us army grant 
path is an international nonprofit organization funded by private donors 
we have a research program and agreement with the path mvi to evaluate in a preclinical feasibility study our syncon dna vaccine development platform to target antigens from plasmodium species and deliver them intradermally using the cellectra electroporation device

research and development expenses the million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to  was primarily due to higher costs related to work performed for the niaid contract  higher outside services and contract labor expenses related to research and development projects  higher outside engineering professional services related to cellectra development  higher clinical trial costs and higher personnel costs due to greater employee headcount on average throughout the year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses incurred by our norwegian subsidiaries as these entities ceased operations in as well as lower stock based compensation expense 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our products through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter our plan based on new circumstances or events 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include business development expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to lower legal and related fees associated with the merger and other corporate matters 
upon closing of the merger in  we incurred costs such as merger related compensation to key employees  higher accounting  audit and valuation fees  higher insurance costs  and higher employee stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of all inovio stock options 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in expenses incurred by our norwegian subsidiaries as these entities ceased operations in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in recurring operating expenses including the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the merger due to a full year operating as a combined company in when compared to a partial year in

other income expense  net we recorded other income expense  net  for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the increase in other income expense  net  is primarily due to the revaluation of registered common stock warrants issued by us in october  august and july we revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value

table of contents as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have operated at a loss since  and we expect to continue to operate at a loss for some time 
the amount of the accumulated deficit will continue to increase  as it will be expensive to continue research and development efforts 
if these activities are successful and if we receive approval from the fda to market our dna vaccine products  then we will need to raise additional funding to market and sell the approved vaccine products and equipment 
we cannot predict the outcome of the above matters at this time 
we are evaluating potential collaborations as an additional way to fund operations 
we will continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs into the third quarter of off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue  expenses  and results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in united states interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  and the recent fluctuations in interest rates and availability of funding in the credit markets primarily impact the performance of our investments 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
fair value measurements we account for our common stock warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the registered warrants require the issuance of 
table of contents registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify registered warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability that is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
the investment in affiliated entity represents our ownership interest in the korean based company  vgx int l 
we report this investment at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet using the closing price of vgx int l s shares of common stock as listed on the korean stock exchange 
as of december   we no longer hold trading securities 
previously  we classified all of our investment securities consisting of ars issued primarily by municipalities as trading securities and reported them on the consolidated balance sheet at market value

the ars rights permitted us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time during the period of june  through july  on july  we exercised the ars rights  and we sold the remaining ars held by us at par value 
foreign currency risk we have operated primarily in the united states and most transactions during the year ended december   have been made in united states dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  with the exception of the valuation of our equity investment in vgx int l which is denominated in south korean won 
we do not have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place 
certain transactions related to us are denominated primarily in foreign currencies  including euros  british pounds  canadian dollars  south korean won and singapore dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where we conduct business  including the impact of the existing crisis in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the united states dollar and the noted foreign currencies 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
currently  we do not expect the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of other currencies to be material in
