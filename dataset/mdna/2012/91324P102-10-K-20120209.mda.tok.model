item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview regulatory trends and uncertainties 
as a result of our participation in various government health care programs  both as a payer and as a service provider to payers  we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding  enrollments  payment adjustments and audits that could materially and adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we participate in various federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  various medicaid programs and chip  and receive substantial revenues from these programs 
we also provide services to payers through our optum businesses 
these programs generally are subject to frequent changes  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets  or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs 
for example  cms reduced or froze medicare advantage benchmarks that drive reimbursements between and  and beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks will take effect  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county 
although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis  terminated benefit plans in certain counties  and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these benchmark reductions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program 
as part of the health reform legislation  cms has developed a system whereby a plan that meets certain quality ratings will 
table of contents be entitled to various quality bonus payments 
there can be no assurance that any of our plans will meet these quality ratings 
our revenues  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by funding reductions  or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments 
similarly  any reduction in medicare advantage payments could result in downward pressure on payments made to our collaborative care business in exchange for services provided to medicare advantage plans 
our participation in the medicare advantage  medicare part d  and various medicaid and chip programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms 
funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level  and general political issues and priorities 
a reduction or less than expected increase  or a protracted delay  in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may materially and adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
state medicaid programs are also imposing other reforms  such as medical loss ratio requirements on medicaid managed care organizations  which generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the ratio standards 
cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs  including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers as well as  for medicare part d plans only  based on comparing costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs 
some state medicaid programs utilize a similar process 
for example  our unitedhealthcare medicare retirement and unitedhealthcare community state businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to cms or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us 
in  cms announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers  and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit 
these audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans 
in december  cms published for public comment a new proposed radv audit and payment adjustment methodology 
the proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples 
in february  cms announced that it would be making changes to the proposed methodology based  in part  on comments submitted by industry participants 
as of the date of this filing  cms has not published the revised methodology 
depending on the methodology utilized  potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  the office of inspector general for hhs has audited our risk adjustment data for two local plans and has initially communicated its findings  although we cannot predict the final outcome of the audit process 
any payment adjustments required as a result of the audits or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding these audits 
cms conducts a variety of routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews across the industry 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  cms conducted an audit of our medicare advantage and part d business 
we are in the process of responding to preliminary findings 
as with any cms review  in the event we fail to comply with applicable cms and state laws  regulations and rules  our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
under the medicaid managed care program  state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs 
if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts  we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans 
under the medicare part d program  to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members  our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark  which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark  we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us 
for example  we lost approximately  of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members effective january   because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government 
in general  our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid  or our competitors submit bids at lower rates than our bids  our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws  regulations and standards  including with respect to third party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf  or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents  our business  reputation  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  protection  use  transmission  disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal  state  international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers 
these laws  rules and requirements are subject to change 
further  many of our businesses are subject to the payment card industry data security standards pci dss  which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities 
see item  business government regulation for additional information 
hipaa also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls  we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices 
our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents  security attacks and breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses  coordinated attacks by activist entities  emerging cybersecurity risks  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other similar events 
emerging and advanced security threats  including coordinated attacks  require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations 
compliance with new laws  regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs  and may constrain our ability to manage our business model 
for example  our ability to collect  disclose and use sensitive personal information may be further restricted  and we are awaiting final hhs regulations for many key aspects of the arra amendments to hipaa  such as with regard to marketing  electronic health records and access reports which may necessitate system changes 
in addition  hhs has announced a pilot audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities through although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities  an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws  regulations or requirements  or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information  whether by us or by one of our third party service providers  could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  results of operations  financial position and cash flows  including the following consequences mandatory disclosure of a privacy or security breach to the media  significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents  enforcement actions  material fines and penalties  an impact on our ability to process credit card transactions as well as an increase in related expenses  litigation  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products 
we provide pbm services through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare businesses 
each business is subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies  the development and use of formularies  and the use of average wholesale prices 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 
optumrx also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose optumrx to civil and criminal penalties 
our pbm businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers  and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies  including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to timely process and dispense prescriptions and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa 
the dol  which is the agency that enforces erisa  could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations 
in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations  we 
table of contents could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 
unitedhealthcare employer individual is transitioning pharmacy benefit management for approximately million of its commercial members  including pharmacy claims adjudication and customer service  from medco health solutions  inc to optumrx beginning in if we are unable to execute the transition effectively  unitedhealthcare employer individual could face loss of business  which could adversely impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate 
we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors  including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability and diversity of product offerings 
for our unitedhealthcare reporting segment  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the bluecross blueshield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare and medicaid specialty services 
for our optumrx business  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and optuminsight reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses 
in particular markets  competitors may have greater capabilities  resources or market share  a more established reputation  superior supplier or health care professional arrangements  existing business relationships  or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals  physician groups and other care professionals in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or increase profitability 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect  if membership or demand for other services declines  or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for services 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract for these services at competitive prices 
failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers  whether in network or out of network  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in any particular market  physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical capitation arrangement  the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider 
to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
further  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the 
table of contents services available to our members 
there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us 
in those cases  we do not have a pre established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members 
in some states  the amount of compensation due to these out of network providers is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances  it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms 
in some instances  providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 
for example  we are involved in litigation with out of network providers  as described in more detail in litigation matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accountable care organizations acos and other organizational structures that physicians  hospitals  and other care providers choose may change the way that these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape 
these changes may affect the way that we price our products and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations  and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the success of certain optum businesses depends on maintaining satisfactory physician relationships 
the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians  or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician  our revenues could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  our affiliated physician organizations contract with health insurance and hmo competitors of unitedhealthcare 
if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these health insurance or hmo companies  our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and certain health care providers are customers of our optum businesses 
given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses  failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract  retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants 
our products are sold in part through independent producers and consultants who assist in the production and servicing of business 
we typically do not have long term contracts with our producers and consultants  who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and or market health care products and services of our competitors 
as a result  we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance 
our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent producers and consultants or if we do not adequately provide support  training and education to them regarding our product portfolio  or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 
because producer commissions are included as administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the health reform legislation  these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other administrative costs 
our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures  including potential reductions in commissions 
in addition  there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of producers selling health care products and the payments they receive 
these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and producers marketing and selling these companies products 
for example  cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of producers who market medicare products 
these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans  which could materially and adversely impact our ability to market our products 
our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
under our agreements with aarp  we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance and other products and services to aarp members under a supplement health insurance program the aarp program 
we also provide aarp branded medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans to both aarp members and non members 
our agreements with aarp extend to december  for the aarp program and december  for the medicare advantage and medicare part d offerings 
our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers 
the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including  depending on the 
table of contents agreement  a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in our financial condition  material changes in the medicare programs  material harm to aarp caused by us  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  meet our corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  and diversity commitments  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to various litigation actions  which could damage our reputation and  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to  among other things  the design  management and delivery of our product and service offerings 
these matters have included or could in the future include claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees  customers  and contracted and non contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  tort including claims related to the delivery of health care services  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers 
we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks 
although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages in some circumstances  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters  however  it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded 
a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters 
the legal actions we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity  which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in select markets and businesses 
unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 
unfavorable economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services 
for example  decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans  lower enrollment in our non employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans 
unfavorable economic conditions have also caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
in addition  unfavorable economic conditions could continue to adversely impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers 
all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment  state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medicaid and chip 
a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs  such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges or fees on select fee for service and capitated medical claims  and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers  which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings 
further  unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our optum businesses  including health plans  hmos  hospitals  care providers  employers and others  which could  in turn  materially and adversely affect optum s financial results 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position 
volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities  which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december  relatively low interest rates on investments  such as those experienced during recent years  have adversely impacted our investment income  and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further 
table of contents adversely affect our investment income 
in addition  a delay in payment of principal and or interest by issuers  or defaults by issuers primarily from investments in corporate and municipal bonds  could reduce our net investment income and we may be required to write down the value of our investments  which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 
we also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions  and many other factors beyond our control can materially and adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 
there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  changes in issuer financial conditions  illiquidity or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 
if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired  our results of operations  shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially and adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets were billion as of december   representing of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
for example  the manner in or the extent to which the health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business 
similarly  the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions 
in addition  from time to time we divest businesses  and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  adversely impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
large scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
large scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death 
such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
for example  in the event of a natural disaster  bioterrorism attack  pandemic or other extreme events  we could face  among other things  significant medical costs and increased use of health care services 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems  or if our technology products do not operate as intended  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving systems and regulatory standards  emerging cybersecurity risks and threats  and changing customer patterns 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have difficulty preventing  detecting and controlling fraud  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate  upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities  protecting our systems against cybersecurity risks and threats  enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to protect  consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products  and these products may contain unexpected design 
table of contents defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer 
connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry 
a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  an uncertain and rapidly evolving federal  state  international and industry legislative and regulatory framework related to the health information technology market may make it difficult to achieve and maintain compliance and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms  and our ability to compete in this market 
if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products  our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations 
many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states departments of insurance 
we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary 
a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions  as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle  repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions successfully could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments  acquisitions  divestitures  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions 
if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations 
we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment  which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings  our business  prospects  results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
downgrades in our credit ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each credit rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders 
downgrades in our credit 
table of contents ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows

executive overview general unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well being company  whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and help make health care work better 
through our diversified family of businesses  we leverage core competencies in advanced  enabling technology  health care data  information and intelligence  and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system 
these core competencies are deployed within our two distinct  but strategically aligned  business platforms health benefits operating under unitedhealthcare and health services operating under optum 

table of contents unitedhealthcare serves the health benefits needs of individuals across life s stages through three businesses 
unitedhealthcare employer individual serves individual consumers and employers 
the unique health needs of seniors are served by unitedhealthcare medicare retirement 
unitedhealthcare community state serves the public health marketplace  offering states innovative medicaid solutions 
optum serves health system participants including consumers  physicians  hospitals  governments  insurers  distributors and pharmaceutical companies  through its optumhealth  optuminsight and optumrx businesses 
revenues our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one year period  and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs 
effective in  commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products  as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and implementing regulations  that fall below certain targets for large employer groups  for small employer groups and for individuals  subject to state specific exceptions are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually 
as a result  our quarterly premium revenue may be reduced by a pro rata estimate of our full year premium rebate payable under the health reform legislation 
any required rebate payments for the current year are made in the third quarter of the subsequent year 
we also generate revenues from fee based services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants 
for both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements  we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services  transaction processing  health care professional services  and access to contracted networks of physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals 
we also generate service revenues from our optum businesses 
product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business 
we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities  investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold  or other than temporarily impaired 
operating costs medical costs 
our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate  price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs 
controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients consumers  health professionals  hospitals  pharmaceutical technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 
medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims  and our estimates for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
our medical care ratio  calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  reflects the combination of pricing  rebates  benefit designs  consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 
operating costs 
operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits  agent and broker commissions  premium taxes and assessments  professional fees  advertising and occupancy costs 
we seek to improve our operating cost ratio  calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues  for an equivalent mix of business 
however  changes in business mix  such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio 
cash flows we generate cash primarily from premiums  service and product revenues and investment income  as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments 
our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs  payments on debt  purchases of investments  acquisitions  dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases 
for more information on our cash flows  see liquidity below 
business trends our businesses participate in the us health economy  which comprises approximately of us gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years 
we expect overall spending on health care in the us to continue to grow in the future  due to inflation  medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement  regulatory requirements  demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and enacted health care reforms  which could also impact our results of 
table of contents operations 
in  we expect increasing unit costs to continue to be the primary cost driver of medical cost trends and we project steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year 
we also expect an increase in prescription drug costs 
we will continue to work to manage medical cost trends through care management programs  affordable network relationships  pay for performance reimbursement programs for care providers  and targeted clinical management programs and initiatives focused on improving quality and affordability 
additionally  employers are continuing to select products with benefit designs that shift more of the costs to the employee 
this cost shifting continues to mitigate increases in medical cost trends 
our businesses focus on affordability  consumer empowerment  wellness and prevention  payment innovations  and enhanced distribution to better serve our customer and consumer needs and demands 
these business objectives are consistent with the goals of health care reform 
we expect that the portion of our costs that is tied to incentive contracts that reward providers for outcome based results and improved cost efficiencies will continue to increase 
care providers are facing market pressures to change from fee for service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer  integrated care across care providers and pay for performance payment structures 
this is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems 
the impact of such changes on our results of operations is uncertain but  we expect them to moderate the rate at which medical costs increase 
this trend also provides growth opportunities for our optumhealth and optuminsight businesses 
we attempt to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends  while balancing growth  margins  competitive dynamics and premium rebates at the local market level 
we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business 
however  changes in business mix  such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government sponsored public sector programs and health reform legislation may impact our premiums  medical costs and medical care ratio 
in  we continue to expect reimbursements to be under pressure through government payment rates and continued market competition in commercial products 
regulatory trends and uncertainties in the first quarter of  the health reform legislation was signed into law 
the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market  the medicaid and medicare programs  chip and other aspects of the health care system 
hhs  the dol  the irs and the treasury department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation  but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation  all of which have a variety of effective dates  remain pending 
the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth and restrict premium rate increases in certain products and market segments  increase our medical and administrative costs  or expose us to an increased risk of liability  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also anticipate that the health reform legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality  with a focus on prevention  wellness and disease management 
we believe demand for many of our service offerings  such as consulting services  data management  information technology and related infrastructure construction  disease management  and population based health and wellness programs will continue to grow 
following is a listing of some of the key provisions of the health reform legislation and other regulatory items along with management s view of the related trends and uncertainties that may cause reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating performance or of future financial condition 
premium rebates effective in  commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually 
the potential for and size of the rebates are measured by state  by group size and by licensed subsidiary 
in the aggregate  the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained 
the disaggregation of insurance pools into smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed 
other market participants could implement changes to their business practices in response to the health reform legislation  which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share 
insurers could elect to change pricing  modify product features or benefits  adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market 
they could also seek to adjust 
table of contents their operating costs by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non medical product features and services 
we have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to the health reform legislation  including reducing producer commissions  and are implementing changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment 
these changes could impact future growth in these products 
commercial rate increase review the health reform legislation also requires hhs to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans 
hhs established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above with state specific thresholds to be applicable commencing september  and clarified that the hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes 
the regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increase of or applicable state threshold or more 
under the regulations  the hhs rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets 
the federal government is also encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by affected commercial health plans including large group plans and providing funding to assist in those state level reviews 
since august  hhs has allocated approximately million for grants to states to enable the states to conduct more robust reviews of requests for premium increases 
many states have applied for and received grants  and state regulators have signaled their intent to more closely scrutinize premium rates 
premium rate review legislation ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states in as a result  we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states  including california  new york and rhode island 
depending on the level of scrutiny by the states  there is a broad range of potential business impacts 
for example  it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends  leading to the risk of operating margin compression 
medicare advantage rates as part of the health reform legislation  medicare advantage risk adjusted benchmarks  which ultimately drive our cms payments  were reduced by in from levels 
beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage benchmarks have taken effect benchmarks will ultimately range from of medicare fee for service rates in high cost areas to in low cost areas  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county 
these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels 
we expect the rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends  placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs 
there are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations  which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions 
for example  we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management  adjust members benefits and decide on a county by county basis in which geographies to participate 
additionally  achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions 
we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the increases in the number of people eligible for medicare in coming years 
longer term  market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare part d and medicare supplement insurance offerings 
it is also anticipated that cms will release the final medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv audit methodology in radv audits are intended to validate that the risk adjusted payments medicare advantage plans receive are supported by medical record data 
depending upon the final radv methodology released by cms  recoveries from radv audits may result in additional rate pressure 
budget control act s medicare sequestration congress passed the budget control act of  which  following the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to cut the federal deficit by trillion  triggers automatic across the board budget cuts sequestration  including medicare spending cuts averaging of total program costs for nine years  starting in medicare payments exempted from sequestration include part d low income subsidies  part d catastrophic subsidies  and payments to states for coverage of medicare cost sharing for certain low income medicare beneficiaries 

table of contents the office of management and budget is responsible for determining  calculating and implementing cuts 
we are exploring strategies to mitigate any impact that may result from the cuts beginning in insurance industry fee the health reform legislation includes an annual insurance industry assessment billion levied on the insurance industry in with increasing annual amounts thereafter 
the annual fee will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any us health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year  subject to certain exceptions and uncertainties 
our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in due to the non deductibility of these fees 
premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact of these and other provisions 
premium increases are generally subject to state regulatory approval and potentially to federal review 
other market participants could increase premiums at different levels which could impact our market share positively or negatively 
state based exchanges and coverage expansion effective in  exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers as well as certain chip eligibles 
the exchanges will be state based 
if a state fails to establish an exchange by the required deadline  exchanges may be administered through a federal state partnership or by the federal government 
among other things  the health reform legislation eliminates pre existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits and restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded 
the health reform legislation also provides for expanded medicaid coverage effective in january the health reform legislation includes an moe provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by medicaid  until the secretary of hhs determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state 
the moe provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above of the federal poverty level from medicaid before implementation of expanded medicaid coverage effective in january however  states with  or projecting  a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the moe provision 
additionally  individual states may accelerate their procurement of medicaid managed care services in and for sizeable groups of medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads in advance of medicaid market expansion taking place in the congressional budget office has estimated that up to million additional individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the health reform legislation is implemented broadly in its current form 
this represents an opportunity for us to increase membership 
however  serving these individuals may generate different profit margins than our existing business due to various factors  including the health status of the newly insured individuals 
we expect existing participants in medicare and medicaid and new enrollees in state based exchanges to transition between products and programs  offering us opportunities to design products and services that enable us to compete for new business across business segments on an ongoing basis 
an acceleration of medicaid managed care services could increase near term business growth opportunities for unitedhealthcare community state 
however  if states are successful in obtaining moe waivers and allow certain medicaid programs to expire  we could experience reduced medicaid enrollment 
court proceedings court proceedings related to the health reform legislation continue to evolve 
these court proceedings  and the potential for congressional action to impede implementation  create additional uncertainties with respect to the law

table of contents results of operations compared to results consolidated financial results revenues the increases in revenues for the year ended december  were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our unitedhealthcare businesses  commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all optum businesses 
medical costs medical costs for the year ended december  increased due to risk based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use  and a modest increase in health system utilization  mainly in outpatient and physician office settings 
unit cost increases represented the majority of the increases in our medical cost trend  with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals 
for each period  our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods 
changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods  resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period  are included in total medical costs reported for the current period 
for and there was million and million  respectively  of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 
the favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness  which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels 
the favorable development in also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers  and favorable resolution of certain state based assessments 
operating costs the increase in our operating costs for the year ended december  was due to business growth  including an increased mix of optum and unitedhealthcare fee based and service revenues  which have higher operating costs  and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance 
these factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i branded clinical trial service businesses 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 
income tax rate the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in  due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the health reform legislation

see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the types and services from which each of our reportable segments derives its revenues 
transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to unitedhealthcare customers by optumrx  certain product offerings and clinical services sold to unitedhealthcare by optumhealth  and health information and technology solutions  consulting and other services sold to unitedhealthcare by optuminsight

unitedhealthcare s earnings from operations for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio  which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in  and lower favorable reserve development levels 
in our medicare part d stand alone business  we estimate that we entered january down approximately  people  primarily as a result of the loss of approximately  of our auto assigned low income subsidy medicare part d beneficiaries in a number of regions being automatically reassigned to other plans as part of the annual bid process managed by cms 
we believe that we will grow from this level throughout the course of the year in the open retail market 
in february  we added  medicare advantage members from the acquisition of xlhealth corporation 
optum 
total revenue for these businesses increased in due to business growth and acquisitions at optumhealth and optuminsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at optumrx 
optum s operating margin for the year ended december  was down compared to the decrease was due to changes in business mix within optum s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements 
the results by segment were as follows optumhealth increased revenues at optumhealth for the year ended december  were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services  as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings 
earnings from operations for the year ended december  and operating margin decreased compared to the decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services 
optuminsight increased revenues at optuminsight for the year ended december  were due to the impact of organic growth and the full year impact of acquisitions  which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in june the increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december  reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in as well as the effect on earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i branded clinical trial service businesses 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 

table of contents optumrx the increase in optumrx revenues for the year ended december  was due to increased prescription volumes  primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare retirement business  and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions 
intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
optumrx earnings from operations and operating margins for decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications 
we will consolidate and manage the majority of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs internally when our contract with medco health solutions  inc expires at the end of the investments in our infrastructure and to expand our capacity will likely cause a decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin as in  optumrx expects to absorb approximately million of the million consolidated in sourcing related operating costs 
as a result of this transition  optumrx expects to add million members on a staged basis in see item a  risk factors for a discussion of certain risks associated with the transition of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs to optumrx 
results of operations compared to results consolidated financial results revenues the increases in revenues for were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends 
growth in customers served by our health services businesses  particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs  increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth

for and  there was million and million  respectively  of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years 
the medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services  successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously 
operating costs operating costs for increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses  which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses  goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at optuminsight  which is discussed in more detail below  an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the medicare advantage annual enrollment period  costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation  increased advertising costs  and the absorption of new business development and start up costs 
income tax rate the increase in our effective income tax rate for as compared to resulted from a benefit in the tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation due to the health reform legislation

optumhealth increased revenues in optumhealth for were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets 
the operating margin for decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business  new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the federal mental health parity addiction equity act of optuminsight increased revenues in optuminsight for were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance 
the decrease in operating margin for was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i branded clinical trial service businesses 
in addition  increases in the mix of lower margin business  continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment 
optumrx the increased optumrx revenues for were primarily due to growth in customers served through medicare part d prescription drug plans by our unitedhealthcare medicare retirement business and higher prescription volumes 
intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were billion and billion for and  respectively

liquidity  financial condition and capital resources liquidity introduction we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy 
we continually forecast and manage our cash  investments  working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility 
cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non cash expenses 
the risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses  geographies and customers  our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk based businesses  and continued productivity improvements that lower our operating costs 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  liquid  investment grade  debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors approved investment policy  which focuses on preservation of capital through risk tolerances around liquidity  credit quality  issuer limits  asset class diversification  income and duration 
the policy emphasizes investment grade bonds with durations that are short to intermediate term in nature 
the policy also generally governs return objectives  regulatory limitations and tax implications 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile 
most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the naic 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
except in the case of extraordinary dividends  these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
these dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval 
if the dividend  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus  the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval 

table of contents in  based on the statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was billion 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including billion of extraordinary dividends 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including million of extraordinary dividends 
our non regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions  reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures  repay debt  or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and or repurchases of our common stock  depending on market conditions

given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents  we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies  primarily used in valuing our level securities those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs  may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date

recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 other expenses topic fees paid to the federal government by health insurers a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
this update addresses the recognition and classification of an entity s share of the annual health insurance industry assessment the fee mandated by health reform legislation 
the fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after january  and is not deductible for income tax purposes 
the fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entity s net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any us health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year 
in accordance with the amendments in asu  our liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once we provide qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable first applicable in with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 
we have determined that there have been no other recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim processing backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  health care professional contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care professional and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can be up to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
medical costs in  and  included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of million  million and million  respectively 
this development represented approximately  and of the medical claims payable balance as of december   and  respectively 
in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt  claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors 
if actual claims submission rates from providers which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated  our reserves may be significantly impacted 

table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factors increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions medical cost pmpm trend factors 
medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months  provider contracting and expected unit costs  benefit design  and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control 
we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product growth  employment and disposable income 
a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including our ability and practices to manage medical costs  changes in level and mix of services utilized  mix of benefits offered including the impact of co pays and deductibles  changes in medical practices  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical costs pmpm trend increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates  net earnings would have increased or decreased by million and diluted net earnings per common share would have increased or decreased by per share 
the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals 
through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable 
table of contents regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
effective in  premium revenue subject to the premium rebates of the health reform legislation are recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract  when that amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated premium is revised each period to reflect current experience 
the most significant factors in estimating these rebates are financial performance within each aggregation set  including medical claim experience and effective tax rates  as well as changes in business mix and regulatory requirements 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 
our medicare advantage and part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under cms risk adjustment payment methodology 
the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier 
we and other health care plans collect  capture  and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
cms uses submitted diagnosis codes  demographic information  and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries 
cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations  the actual amount of cms retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates 
this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and  accordingly  our profitability 
medicare advantage risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding these audits 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
to determine whether goodwill is impaired  we perform a multi step impairment test 
first  we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values 
if the qualitative analysis is not conclusive  or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing  we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows  which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors 
significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations  capital requirements and income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
for each reporting unit  comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 
forecasts and long term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with  and use inputs from  our internal long term business plan and strategy 
key assumptions used in these forecasts include revenue trends 
key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed 
significant factors include membership growth  medical trends  and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments 
additional macro economic assumptions around unemployment  gdp growth  interest rates  and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated 
medical cost trends 
see further discussion of medical costs trends within medical costs above 
similar factors are considered in estimating our long term medical trends at the reporting unit level 
operating productivity 
we forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives 
capital levels 
the capital structure and requirements for each business is considered 
although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units  due to the 
table of contents long term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections 
that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item  business government regulation 
for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long term forecasts  see item a  risk factors in part i and regulatory trends and uncertainties above 
discount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts 
this risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples 
beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk free rates and equity risk premiums  our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit specific factors 
such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk 
we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit 
company specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty 
the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future 
we elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of january  all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values  thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of december  intangible assets 
finite lived  separately identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg  membership lists  customer contracts  trademarks and technology 
we do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets 
our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives 
our most significant intangible assets are customer related intangibles which represent of our total intangible balance of billion 
customer related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition 
the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer related assets include projected revenue and earnings growth  retention rate  perpetuity growth rate and discount rate 
these initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results eg  customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested 
our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset s or asset group s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value 
consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including changes in the use of an intangible asset  changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value  experienced or expected operating cash flow deterioration or losses  adverse changes in customer populations  adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value  and other factors 
following the identification of any potential impairment indicators  we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite lived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets 
if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment would be recorded 
there were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during investments as of december   we had investments with a carrying value of billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
we evaluate investments for impairment considering factors including our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost  the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer 

table of contents for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other causes  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
for equity securities  we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period 
if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term  we recognize the impairment in through our income statement 
inherently  there is uncertainty included in the impairment assessment of investments 
our analysis includes significant judgments and estimates including the fair value of the investment  the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the issuer other forms of credit enhancements  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and general industry and sector economic conditions 
fair values 
we perform an analysis around the fair values of the securities held including obtaining an understanding of the pricing method and procedures over the valuation of securities 
fair values of available for sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
we obtain one price for each security primarily from a third party pricing service pricing service  which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value 
the pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities  making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information 
for securities not actively traded  the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities 
inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  benchmark yields  credit spreads  default rates and prepayment speeds  and non binding broker quotes 
as we are responsible for the determination of fair value  we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value 
specifically  we compare the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service  its custodian  its investment consultant and or third party investment advisors  and changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices 
based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service  we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service 
other than temporary impairment assessment 
individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the factors above including the length of time of impairment  credit standing  financial condition  near term prospects and other factors specific to the issuer 
other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity 
given the nature of our portfolio  primarily investment grade securities  the primary causes of historical impairments were market related eg  interest rate fluctuations  etc as opposed to credit related 
we do not expect that trend to change in the near term 
generally  we do not assume that we will be required to sell a security because our large cash holdings reduce this risk 
however  our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change 
we believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value 
the unrealized losses at december  and were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  mortgage backed securities  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy 
total other than temporary impairments during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of years and a weighted average credit rating of aa as of december  we have minimal securities collateralized by sub prime or alt a securities  and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default 
the judgments and estimates related to fair value and other than temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including circumstances may change over time  industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold 
our assessment of the financial 
table of contents condition and near term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing  or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop 
as discussed further in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by million 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence both positive and negative for which it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
after application of the valuation allowances  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we have established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on our earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by million 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel  if appropriate  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict  particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines  penalties or punitive damages  present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy  involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies  are in the early stages of the proceedings  or could result in a change in business practices 
accordingly  in many cases  we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred 
given this inherent uncertainty  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
we evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined 
legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference in this report 

table of contents concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base 
as of december   we had an aggregate billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
currently  the reinsurer is rated by am best as a 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 
as of december   billion of our investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates  which may materially impact our investment income 
also  optumhealth bank held billion of deposit liabilities as of december  at interest rates that vary with market rates 
the fair value of certain of our fixed rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates 
as of december   billion of our investments were fixed rate debt securities and billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt 
an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities  as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time  either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts 
in the second half of  we terminated all of our interest rate swap fair value hedges with a billion notional amount in order to lock in the impact of low market floating interest rates and reduce the effective interest rate on hedged long term debt 
the gain of million will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
additional information on our interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
since the interest rate swaps have been terminated  the fair value of our long term debt is now more sensitive to hypothetical changes in interest rates as the change in the fair value of the debt is no longer offset by the swaps 
also as a result of the swaps termination  our exposure to hypothetical changes in market rates on our interest expense is less volatile 

table of contents the following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by or as of december  and on our investment income and interest expense per annum  and the fair value of our investments and debt in millions december  increase decrease in market interest rate investment income per annum a interest expense per annum a fair value of investments b fair value of debt nm nm december  increase decrease in market interest rate investment income per annum a interest expense per annum a fair value of investments fair value of debt nm nm nm not meaningful a given the low absolute level of short term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of december  and  the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the point reduction is not meaningful 
b as of december   some of our investments had interest rates below so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full point reduction 
as of december   we had million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds  a portion of which were invested in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments
