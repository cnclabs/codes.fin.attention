we operate in one reportable segment cloud services for business 
during the past three years  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from did based services  including efax  onebox and evoice

we intend to continue to invest in patents  to aggressively protect our patent assets from unauthorized use and to continue to generate patent licensing revenues from authorized users 
the following table sets forth our key operating metrics as of or for the years ended december   and in thousands except for percentages december  paying telephone numbers year ended december  subscriber revenues fixed variable total subscriber revenues percentage of total subscriber revenues fixed variable revenues did based non did based total revenues the amounts above reflect the change in estimate relating to the remaining service obligations to annual efax subscribers see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  which reduced subscriber revenues for the year ended december  by million critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenues 
our subscriber revenues substantially consist of monthly recurring subscription and usage based fees  which are primarily paid in advance by credit card 
in accordance with gaap  the company defers the portions of monthly  quarterly  semi annually and annually recurring subscription and usage based fees collected in advance and recognizes them in the period earned 
additionally  we defer and recognize subscriber activation fees and related direct incremental costs over a subscriber s estimated useful life 
our patent revenues included in other revenues consist of patent license revenues generated under license agreements that provide for the payment of contractually determined fully paid up or royalty bearing license fees to j global in exchange for the grant of non exclusive  retroactive and future licenses to our patented technology 
patent revenues also consist of revenues generated from the sale of patents 
patent license revenues are recognized when earned over the term of the license agreements 
with regard to fully paid up license arrangements  we generally recognize as revenue in the period the license agreement is executed the portion of the payment attributable to past use of the patented technology and amortize the remaining portion of such payments on a straight line basis over the life of the licensed patent s 
with regard to royalty bearing license arrangements  we recognize revenues of license fees earned during the applicable period 
with regard to patent sales  we recognize as revenue in the period of the sale the amount of the purchase price over the carrying value of the patent s sold 
our advertising revenues included in other revenues primarily consist of revenues derived by delivering email messages to our customers on behalf of advertisers 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertising services are performed  provided that no significant j global obligations remain and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
investments 
we account for our investments in debt securities in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc requires that certain debt and equity securities be classified into one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity securities 
these investments are typically comprised primarily of readily marketable corporate debt securities  auction rate debt  preferred securities and certificates of deposits 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluate such determination at each balance sheet date 
held to maturity securities are those investments that we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity until realized 
trading securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in interest and other income on our consolidated statement of operations 
all securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis 
we assess whether an other than temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we comply with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements 
asc clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  asc establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace 
level unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity 
the fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
we measure our cash equivalents and investments at fair value 
our cash equivalents and short term investments and other debt securities are primarily classified within level investments in auction rate securities are classified within level the valuation technique used under level consists of a discounted cash flow analysis which includes numerous assumptions  some of which include prevailing implied credit risk premiums  incremental credit spreads and illiquidity risk premium  and a market comparables model where the security is valued based upon indicators from the secondary market of what discounts buyers demand when purchasing similar auction rate securities 
there was no change in the technique during the period 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued primarily using quoted market prices utilizing market observable inputs 
our investments in auction rate securities are classified within level because there are no active markets for the auction rate securities and therefore we are unable to obtain independent valuations from market sources 
some of the inputs to the cash flow model are unobservable in the market 
there were no assets measured using level valuation methodologies as of december share based compensation expense 
we comply with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 compensation stock compensation asc 
accordingly  we measure share based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period using the straight line method 
the measurement of share based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend rate and award cancellation rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation expense and the actual factors  which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation and continue to use the simplified method in developing the expected term used for our valuation of share based compensation in accordance with asc long lived and intangible assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 property  plant  and equipment asc  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determined that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
we have assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined based upon our current and future business needs that the rights to certain external administrative software would not provide any future benefit 
accordingly  we recorded a disposal in the amount of million to the consolidated statement of operations representing the capitalized cost as of december  total disposals of long lived assets for the year ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment pursuant to fasb asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
in connection with the annual impairment test for goodwill  we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we perform the impairment test upon goodwill 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
the impairment test is comprised of two steps a reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value  if the fair value is less than its carrying value  impairment is indicated  and if impairment is indicated in the first step  it is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets to their carrying value at the reporting unit level 
we completed the required impairment review at the end of  and and noted no impairment 
consequently  no impairment charges were recorded 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 income taxes asc  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time 
in assessing this valuation allowance  we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable 
income tax contingencies 
we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 
effective january   the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding uncertain income tax positions 
this guidance found under asc provides guidance on the minimum threshold that an uncertain income tax position is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions taken by a company 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the income tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
uncertain income tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate uncertain income tax positions and establish or release reserves as appropriate under gaap 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts and circumstances existing at that time 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
in addition  we may be subject to examination of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under audit by the california ftb for tax years through the ftb has also issued information document requests regarding the tax year  although no formal notice of audit for has been provided 
it is possible that these audits may conclude in the next months and that the unrecognized tax benefits we have recorded in relation to these tax years may change compared to the liabilities recorded for the periods 
however  it is not possible to estimate the amount  if any  of such change 
we establish reserves for these tax contingencies when we believe that certain tax positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves when changing events and circumstances arise 
non income tax contingencies 
we are currently under audit by various states for non income related taxes including a verbal notice from the canada revenue agency regarding an audit of value added sales taxes for tax years through in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 contingencies asc we make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable based upon available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that we make in accounting for contingencies and the gains and losses that we record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on the liabilities and expenses in our financial statements 
as of december   we had million of non income tax related contingent liabilities 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we reserve for receivables we may not be able to collect 
these reserves are typically driven by the volume of credit card declines and past due invoices and are based on historical experience as well as an evaluation of current market conditions 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves

over the past three years  the fixed portion of our subscriber revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in subscriber revenues over this three year period was due primarily to an increase in our subscriber base offset by the impact of our first quarter change in estimate relating to remaining service obligations to efax annual subscribers see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  which reduced subscriber revenues for the year ended december  by million

loss on disposal of long lived asset 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined based upon our current and future business needs that the rights to certain external administrative software would not provide any future benefit 
accordingly  we recorded a disposal in the amount of million to the consolidated statement of operations representing the capitalized cost as of december  total disposals of long lived assets for the year ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
share based compensation the following table represents the share based compensation expense included in cost of revenues and operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  cost of revenues operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering general and administrative non operating income and expenses interest and other income

interest and other income amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income from to was primarily due to the gain on the sale of investments in the amount of approximately million recognized in and reduced interest income in due to lower cash and investment balances following an acquisition in the fourth quarter the increase in interest and other income from to was primarily due to gain on the sale of investments in the amount of approximately million in interest and other expense

during the fourth quarter of  we determined that one auction rate security was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million to the consolidated statement of operations 
no other than temporary impairments were recorded for fiscal years and income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations including those related to transfer pricing and different tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize 
when necessary  we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
as of december   we had utilizable federal and state california net operating loss carryforwards nols of million and million  respectively  after considering substantial restrictions on the utilization of these nols due to ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we currently estimate that all of the above mentioned federal and state nols will be available for use before their expiration 
these nols expire through the year for the federal and for the state 
in addition  as of december  and  we had available unrecognized state research and development tax credits of million and million  which last indefinitely 
in  the governor of california signed into law legislation that suspended the use of nols for tax years beginning on or after january  and in  the suspension was extended an additional two years through the end of as a result  the company will not be permitted to utilize its california nols generated in prior years to offset taxable income in through for purposes of determining the applicable california income tax due 
current law reinstates use of nols in tax years beginning on or after january  absent extension of the suspension 
income tax expense amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective income tax rate from to was primarily attributable to the following a reversal during the first quarter of approximately million and the third quarter of approximately million of uncertain income tax positions as a result of expiring statutes of limitations  offset by return to provision adjustments in the third quarter of  an increase during in foreign tax credits and our ability to offset such credits against subpart f income  an increase during in the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the us  a decrease during in state income taxes  net of the federal income tax benefits  partially offset by a book but not tax gain on the sale of an impaired auction rate security  resulting in a significant portion of the valuation allowance being reversed  an increase during in return to provision adjustments  and a reversal in of certain income tax contingencies allowed to be recognized as a result of effectively settling the transfer pricing portion of the internal revenue service s audit of our income tax returns for through the decrease in our annual effective income tax rate from to was primarily attributable to the following an increase during in the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the us  an impairment of certain auction rate securities in  which caused an increase in the effective tax rate for the year due to the recognition of a valuation allowance  a book but not tax gain on the sale of the above referenced impaired auction rate security  resulting in a significant portion of the valuation allowance being reversed  and a reversal in of certain income tax contingencies allowed to be recognized as a result of effectively settling the transfer pricing portion of the internal revenue service s audit of our income tax returns for through significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged  which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audit by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts and circumstances existing at that time 
we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters in accordance with asc we recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million in accordance with asc for the year ended december  we are currently under audit by the california franchise tax board ftb for tax years through the ftb has also issued information document requests regarding the tax year  although no formal notice of audit for has been provided

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and investments at december   we had total cash and investments of million compared to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from cash provided by operations  the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefit from share based compensation  partially offset by purchases of available for sale investments and dividends paid 
at december   total cash and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
our investments are comprised primarily of readily marketable corporate and governmental debt securities  money market accounts and time deposits

we retain a substantial portion of our cash in foreign jurisdictions for future reinvestment 
as of december   cash and investments held within foreign and domestic jurisdictions were million and million  respectively 
if we were to repatriate funds held overseas  we would incur us income tax on the repatriated amount at an approximate blended federal and state rate of  net of a credit for foreign taxes paid on such amounts 
substantially all of our long term investments consist of corporate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments to affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to december  on august   the company s board of directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders

cash flows our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations  together with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our subscribers  offset by cash payments we make to third parties for their services  employee compensation and tax payments 
the increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily attributable to cash received from our subscribers and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options during the year 
certain tax payments are prepaid during the year and included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
our prepaid tax payments were million and million at december  and  respectively

readers should carefully review the risk factors described in this document as well as in other documents we file from time to time with the sec  including the quarterly reports on form q and any current reports on form k filed or to be filed by us in interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio typically comprised of various holdings  types and maturities 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our return on these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our short and long term investments are typically comprised primarily of readily marketable corporate and governmental debt securities and certificates of deposit 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us and foreign countries interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities greater than one year of approximately million and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of and as of december  and  respectively 
as of december  and we had cash and short term cash equivalent investments in time deposits and money market funds with maturities of days or less of million and million respectively 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investment holdings as of december   an immediate basis point decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by million 
as noted above  we are parties to the credit agreement 
if we were to borrow under the credit agreement we would be subject to the prevailing interest rates and could be exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
we cannot ensure that future interest rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business  prospects  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
to date  we have not entered into interest rate hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks 
foreign currency risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in canada and the european union 
our principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investment in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the canadian dollar  euro and british pound sterling 
however  the exposure is mitigated by our practice of generally reinvesting profits from international operations in order to grow that business 
as we increase our operations in international markets we become increasingly exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally  however  we may do so in the future 
our objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to minimize the potential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings  cash flows and financial position 
foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings in  or for the years ended december   and  net foreign currency transaction gain loss amounted to zero  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   cumulative translation adjustments included in other comprehensive income amounted to million 
we currently do not have derivative financial instruments for hedging  speculative or trading purposes and therefore are not subject to such hedging risk 
however  we may in the future engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
