general we operate in three distinct business segments a ferrous and non ferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling  b platinum group and minor metals recycling pgm and minor metals recycling  and c lead metal product fabricating lead fabricating 
our operating facilities include twenty scrap metal recycling facilities  including a combined aluminum de oxidizing plant  six pgm and minor metal recycling facilities and four lead product manufacturing and fabricating plants 
the company markets a majority of its products domestically but maintains several international customers 
the pgm and minor metals recycling segment includes six facilities located in texas  mississippi  pennsylvania and new jersey 
the lead fabricating segment includes four lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for revenues  accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory  put warrants liability  derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  the testing of goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers  based on free on board fob terms 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments in excess of reserves for such instances that would impact the ultimate collection of revenues therefore  no material provisions have been made when a sale is recognized 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled  and million as of december  and  respectively 
our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  past experience with the accounts  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
derivatives and hedging we are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations 
the primary risks currently managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to protect against volatile commodity prices 
this process ensures a fixed selling price for the material we purchase and process 
we secure selling prices with pgm processors  in ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium  in incremental lots for material which we expect to purchase within an average to day time period 
however  these forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors are not subject to any hedge designation as they are considered within the normal sales exemption provided by asc topic we have in the past entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the credit agreement entered into on march   with jpm chase bank  na  the company was required to terminate the million interest rate swap contract 
as a result  the company paid  to terminate the interest rate swap contract 
with the termination of the interest rate swap contract  no other interest rate swap agreement is outstanding 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of december and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   the company has identified eight reporting units with recorded goodwill 
a list of the company s reporting units and the amount of goodwill recorded in each reporting unit as of december   is as follows in thousands reporting unit goodwill recorded lead fabricating new york state scrap recycling pittsburgh  pa scrap recycling ohio scrap recycling bradford  pa scrap recycling minor metals recycling texas pgm recycling new jersey pgm recycling total in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit  where appropriate  management allocates net deferred taxes and certain corporate maintained liabilities specifically allocable to each reporting unit to the net operating assets of each reporting unit 
the carrying amount is further reduced by impairment charges  if any  made to other long lived assets of a reporting unit 

table of contents since market prices of our reporting units are not readily available  we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
we use a discounted cash flow dcf model of a year forecast with terminal values to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment 
the terminal value captures the value of a reporting unit beyond the projection period in a dcf analysis representing growth in perpetuity  and is the present value of all subsequent cash flows 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including sales volumes  profit margins  tax rates  capital spending  discount rates  and working capital changes 
forecasts of operating and selling  general and administrative expenses are generally based on historical relationships of previous years 
when applying the dcf model  the cash flows expected to be generated are discounted to their present value equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the investment  as well as the time value of money 
this return is an overall rate based upon the individual rates of return for invested capital equity and interest bearing debt 
the return  known as the weighted average cost of capital wacc  is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
for our analysis  we arrived at a discount rate of 
the inputs used in calculating the wacc include i average of capital structure ratios of market participants in the industry which metalico operates of debt and equity  ii an estimate of combined federal and state tax rates iii the cost of baa rated debt based on moody s seasoned corporate bond yields of as of december   iv a required return on equity determined using the build up method under the modified capital asset pricing capm model 
based on our dcf analysis  we determined the computed fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying values and no goodwill impairment charges were required 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of potential future goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying values 
all but one of our reporting units had fair values that exceeded carrying values by more than  an amount that we deem substantial 
we further tested this one reporting unit to changes in forecasted cash flows and discount rates 
assuming all input variables remain constant  if expected cash flows were less than forecasted or  if the discount rate wacc were increased by  the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the computed fair value for this reporting unit  indicating potential impairment  would be as follows potential future impairment sensitivity reporting unit if expected cash flows were less than forecasted if the discount rate wacc were lead fabricating at december   after considering a control premium of  the company s market capitalization exceeded total stockholders equity by approximately million 
the last several months of reflected weakness in financial and commodity prices due primarily to the sovereign debt crisis in europe 
management believes domestic economic conditions continue to show improvement and have resulted in forecasts which  when used in our dcf model  support the carrying value of our goodwill in all of our reporting units 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
future declines in the overall market value of the company s equity and debt securities may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we test all finite lived intangible assets amortizable and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment only if circumstances indicate that possible impairment exists 
to the extent actual useful lives are less than our previously estimated lives  we will increase 
table of contents our amortization expense on a prospective basis 
we estimate useful lives of our intangible assets by reference to both contractual arrangements such as non compete covenants and current  projected  undiscounted cash flows for supplier and customer lists 
at december  and  no indicators of impairment were identified and no adjustments were made to the estimated lives of finite lived assets 
the company tests indefinite lived intangibles such as trademarks and trade names for impairment annually by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to its fair value 
fair value of the intangible asset is calculated using the projected discounted cash flows produced from the intangible 
if the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted cash flows attributed to the intangible asset  the carrying value is no longer considered recoverable and the company will record impairment 
at december   the computed fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 
stock based compensation we recognize expense for equity based compensation ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of deferred stock grants is determined using the average of the high and low trading price for our common stock on the day of grant 
for stock option grants  we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the black scholes method 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility in our stock price  annual forfeiture rates  and exercise behavior 
any assumptions used may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
results of operations the company is divided into three reportable segments scrap metal recycling  which includes three general product categories  ferrous  non ferrous and other scrap services  pgm and minor metals recycling  which includes two general product recycling categories  the platinum group metals pgms and minor metals  which include molybdenum  tungsten  tantalum and niobium  and lead fabricating

december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  average pgm prices are comprised of combined troy ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium scrap and metal commodity markets recycled iron and steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel and cast iron products 
the steel and foundry industries in the united states have been structured to recycle scrap  and  as a result  are highly dependent upon scrap 
in the united states  the primary source of old steel scrap is the automobile 
the recycling rate for automobiles in  the latest year for which statistics were available  was about 
this high recycling rate includes the impact of more than a three quarter million unit increase of vehicles in operation  as compared with those of a recycling rate greater than is a result of the steel industry recycling more steel from automobiles than was used in the domestic production of new vehicles 
in  the automotive recycling industry recycled more than million tons of steel from end of life vehicles through more than car shredders  the equivalent of nearly million automobiles 

table of contents recycling of scrap plays an important role in the conservation of energy because the remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron or steel products from iron ore 
also  consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment 
recycled scrap consists of approximately post consumer old  obsolete scrap  prompt scrap produced in steel product manufacturing plants  and home scrap recirculating scrap from current operations 
scrap prices fluctuated during the first half of  between about and per ton 
composite prices published by iron age scrap price bulletin for no 
heavy melting steel scrap delivered to purchasers in chicago  il  and philadelphia and pittsburgh  pa  averaged about per ton during the first months of as reported by iron age scrap price bulletin  the average price for nickel bearing stainless steel scrap delivered to purchasers in pittsburgh was about  per ton during the first months of  which was higher than the average price of  per ton 
the prices fluctuated widely between a low of  per ton in october and a high of  in late february and early march exports of ferrous scrap increased in to an estimated million tons from million tons during  mainly to turkey  china  taiwan  the republic of korea  and canada  in descending order of export tonnage 
export scrap value increased from billion in to an estimated billion in continuing and growing concern about the european union sovereign debt and banking crisis have adversely affected steel consumer confidence  depressed steel demand  production  and prices  and  thus  caused ferrous scrap prices to fluctuate and possibly decrease considerably 
annual world steel consumption increase was expected to slow to in and in  following annual growth in  according to the world steel association 
platinum group metals ended on a low note  with platinum trading at its most depressed level for the year 
platinum and palladium alike lost approximately a fifth of their value over the course of the previous twelve months 
rhodium lost of its value throughout  reaching depths not seen since may the softening of pgm prices in december was partly related to liquidation in the metal markets as hedge funds and other investors covered losses in equities and moved to the perceived safety of the dollar to maintain cash positions as the year end approached 
the subdued close of  symptomatic of a weakening global economic outlook  was in marked contrast to the exuberance seen in the pgm market a year before when pgm prices rallied 
the beginning of saw a slight lifting of the weak pricing that had engulfed the pgm markets in the latter part of positive economic news  including improved manufacturing data from europe  an expansion of china s purchasing managers index  and higher us jobs numbers led to a risk on mentality that had mostly been lacking in the fourth quarter on the demand side  news of higher vehicle output in germany and the us in also benefitted platinum and palladium pricing 
the global lead market was in surplus during owing to the buildup of lead stocks held in london metal exchange lme and producer warehouses 
north american producer prices increased steadily throughout the first months of the year 
lme lead prices were more volatile in  starting at  per metric ton in january  increasing to  per metric ton in april  and declining to  per metric ton in december 
global stocks of refined lead held in lme warehouses increased by to  tons during the first months of in  about million tons of secondary lead was produced  an amount equivalent to of reported domestic lead consumption 
nearly all of it was recovered from old post consumer scrap

future capital requirements as of december   we had million in cash  availability under the credit agreement of million and total working capital of million 
as of december   our current liabilities totaled million 
we expect to fund our current working capital needs  interest payments and capital expenditures over the next twelve months with cash on hand and cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings available under the credit agreement and potentially available elsewhere  such as vendor financing  manufacturer financing  operating leases and other equipment lines of credit that are offered to us from time to time 
we may also access equity and debt markets for possible acquisitions  working capital and to restructure current debt 
historically  the company has entered into negotiations with its lenders when it was reasonably concerned about potential breaches and prior to the occurrences of covenant defaults 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in lending agreements could result in default under such agreements 
in the event of a default  a lender could refuse to make additional advances under the revolving portion of a credit facility  could require the company to repay some or all of its outstanding debt prior to maturity  and or could declare all amounts borrowed by the company  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
in the event that this occurs  the company may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial position and operating performance 
if necessary  the company could use its existing cash balances or attempt to access equity and debt markets or to obtain new financing arrangements with new lenders or investors as alternative funding sources to restructure current debt 
any issuance of new equity could dilute current shareholders 
any new debt financing could be on terms less favorable than those of our existing financing and could subject us to new and additional covenants 
decisions by lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company would depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s historical and projected financial performance  compliance with the terms of its current or future credit agreements  industry and market trends  internal policies of prospective lenders and investors  and the availability of capital 
no assurance can be had that the company would be successful in obtaining funds from alternative sources 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  result of operations or cash flows 
acquisitions as discussed in note to the financial statements  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of goodman services  inc  a bradford  pennsylvania based full service recycling company with additional facilities in jamestown  new york and canton  ohio 
the acquisition is consistent with our expansion strategy of penetrating geographically contiguous markets and benefiting from intercompany and operating synergies that are available through consolidation 
goodman services locations complement our existing facilities in the great lakes corridor 
bradford is miles from our pittsburgh operations and will become a feed source for the pittsburgh shredder 
jamestown is miles from our buffalo yards 
canton  ohio is in close proximity to our operations in akron  ohio 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   the company expended million for capital improvements and equipment 
the most significant expenditure was for the purchase of a acre parcel of land  including a  square foot building  in suburban buffalo and related costs to install an indoor scrap metal shredder at the site 
as described above  we entered into a million equipment finance agreement to provide for a majority of the construction costs 
contingencies we are involved in certain other legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such other proceedings and litigation will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical 
however  we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company and its subsidiaries are at this time in material compliance with all of their pending remediation obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
increases in either the prime rate or libor may increase interest expense 
assuming our variable borrowings at december  were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year with a corresponding change in cash flows 
we have no open interest rate protection agreements as of december  
table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous  non ferrous  pgm and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and export markets can be volatile located in this annual report 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly as markets allow instead of holding inventories in anticipation of higher commodity prices 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to hedge against the extremely volatile pgm metal prices 
the company estimates that if selling prices decreased by in any of the business units in which it operates  there would not be a material write down of any reported inventory values 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates 
risk from common stock market price we are exposed to risks associated with the market price of our own common stock 
in connection with certain financings  we have issued warrants that can be put to us upon a change of control 
we are required to use the value of our common stock as an input variable to determine the fair value of the liability associated with the put warrant 
fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have an effect on the liability 
for example  if the price of our common stock was higher as of december   the put warrant liability would increase by
