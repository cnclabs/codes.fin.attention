item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management s discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company  including what factors affect our business  what our net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were in  and  why those net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were different from the year before  how all of this affects our overall financial condition  what our expenditures for capital projects were in and and what we expect them to be in  and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  in management s discussion and analysis  we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and for fiscal year compared to fiscal year key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations 
you should keep in mind that on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional billion of our common stock 
at january   we had approximately billion remaining under board authorizations 
on october   we completed a  square foot expansion of our distribution center in savannah  georgia 
the savannah distribution center is now a  square foot  fully automated facility 
on november   we completed our acquisition of dollar giant stores  located in the canadian provinces of british columbia  ontario  alberta and saskatchewan and we have since opened a store in manitoba 
these stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise  contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables  all priced at cad or less 
this is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the united states 
we assign cost to store inventories using the retail inventory method  determined on a weighted average cost basis 
from our inception and through fiscal  we used one inventory pool for this calculation 
because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems  we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january   the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of million in the first quarter of this was a prospective change and did not have any effect on prior periods 
on november   we purchased a new distribution center in san bernardino  california 
this new distribution center replaced our salt lake city  utah leased facility whose lease ended in april on february   we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility is based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
overview our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise 
two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends 
first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions 
second  sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next 
we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales  because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared 
we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales  which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales 
the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 
at january   we operated  stores in states and the district of columbia  as well as the canadian provinces of british columbia  ontario  alberta  saskatchewan and manitoba  with million selling square feet compared to  stores with million selling square feet at january  during fiscal  we opened stores  expanded stores and closed stores  compared to new stores opened  stores expanded  stores acquired and stores closed during fiscal in the current year we increased our selling square footage by 
of the million selling square foot increase in  million was added by expanding existing stores 
the average size of our stores opened in was approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet 
for  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately   selling square feet or about   gross square feet 
we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 
in fiscal  comparable store net sales increased by 
the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a increase in the number of transactions and a increase in average ticket 
we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives  as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in  and we continued the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores 
at january  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately  stores compared to approximately  stores at january  we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers 
in addition  we accept food stamps under the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap in approximately  qualified stores compared to  at the end of with the pressures of the current economic environment  we have seen continued demand for basic  consumable products in as a result  we have continued to shift the mix of inventory carried in our stores to more consumer product merchandise which we believe increases the traffic in our stores and has helped to increase our sales even during the current economic downturn 
while this shift in mix has impacted our merchandise costs we were able to offset that impact in the current year with decreased costs for merchandise in many of our categories 
our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores 
we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last five years 
in  legislation was enacted that increased the federal minimum wage 
the last increase to an hour was effective in july as a result  our wages increased in the third quarter of through the first half of compared with the comparable period in the prior year  however  we offset the increase in payroll costs through increased productivity and continued efficiencies in product flow to our stores 
we must continue to control our merchandise costs  inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 
results of operations the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of net sales 
on january   the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation  rather than one inventory pool as we had done since our inception 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of million in the first quarter of year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales  excluding non cash beginning inventory adjustment non cash beginning inventory adjustment gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales

improvement in initial mark up in many categories and occupancy and distribution cost leverage were offset by an increase in the mix of higher cost consumer product merchandise and a smaller reduction in the shrink accrual rate in fiscal than in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses

our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october 
historically  we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities

at january   our long term borrowings were million and our capital lease commitments were million 
we also have million and million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  under which approximately million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january  in february  we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the agreement is based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
as of january   the million term loan is outstanding under the agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the million revolving line of credit 
we repurchased million shares for million in fiscal we repurchased million shares for million in fiscal we repurchased million shares for million in fiscal at january   we have billion remaining under board authorization 
funding requirements overview  including off balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal to total approximately million  which includes capital expenditures  initial inventory and pre opening costs 
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal are between and million  including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores  the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately stores and approximately million to construct a new distribution center in the northeast united states 
we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at january   including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments  including interest on long term borrowings in millions contractual obligations total thereafter lease financing operating lease obligations capital lease obligations long term borrowings credit agreement revenue bond financing interest on long term borrowings total obligations commitments total expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in thereafter letters of credit and surety bonds freight contracts technology assets telecom contracts total commitments lease financing operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases 
the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to january  for stores that were not yet open on january  long term borrowings credit agreement 
in february  we entered into a five year million unsecured credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the interest rate on the facility was at january  the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
as of january   we had the million term loan outstanding under the agreement and no amounts outstanding under the million revolving line of credit 
revenue bond financing 
in may  we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued million of variable rate demand revenue bonds 
we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition  construction and installation of land  buildings  machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch  mississippi 
at january   the balance outstanding on the bonds was million 
these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable 
the bonds contain a demand provision and  therefore  outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities 
we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate  which was at january  interest on long term borrowings 
this amount represents interest payments on the credit agreement and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at january  commitments letters of credit and surety bonds 
we are a party to two letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  one which provides million for letters of credit and one which provides million for letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january  we also have approximately million of letters of credit and million of surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 
freight contracts 
we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through fiscal the total amount of these commitments is approximately million 
technology assets 
we have commitments totaling approximately million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during telecom contracts 
we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in the total amount of these commitments is approximately million 
derivative financial instruments in march  we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swaps were used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our million variable rate term loan 
under these agreements  we paid interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 
in exchange  the financial institutions paid us at a variable rate  which approximated the variable rate on the debt  excluding the credit spread 
these swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment and expired in march in  we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  or approximately of our domestic truckload fuel needs 
these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings 
we currently have fuel derivative contracts to hedge million gallons of diesel fuel  or approximately of our domestic truckload fuel needs from february through july and million gallons of diesel fuel  or approximately of our domestic truckload fuel needs from august through october critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates 
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates 
following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 
inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
from our inception and through fiscal  we used one inventory pool for this calculation 
because of our investments over the years in our retail technology systems  we were able to refine our estimate of inventory cost under the retail method and on january   the first day of fiscal  we began using approximately inventory pools in our retail inventory calculation 
as a result of this change  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory  at cost  of approximately million in the first quarter of the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments  including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could  under certain circumstances  result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or seasonal  carryover merchandise on hand  historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual  historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions and business trends 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year  therefore  the shrink accrual recorded at january  is based on estimated shrink for most of  including the fourth quarter 
we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last few years 
however  we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition 
we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses  self insurance costs  store level operating expenses  such as property taxes and utilities  and certain other expenses  such as legal reserves 
our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary 
these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors 
certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them 
the related accruals are adjusted as management s estimates change 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual 
our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low 
historically  the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our legal proceedings are described in item legal proceedings beginning on page of this form k 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class or collective action lawsuits  is difficult to assess  quantify or predict 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
in addition  we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws  including relevant case law  and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and  if so  judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded 
we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate
