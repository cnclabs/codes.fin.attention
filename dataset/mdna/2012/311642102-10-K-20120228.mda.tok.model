inflation inflation did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations in recent years  and the company does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  along with various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by the company s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  the company believes that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has selected its critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on its financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are the company s processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  the reserve for warranties  and goodwill impairment 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the company s financial and operating condition 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could have an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue related to the company s measurement equipment and related software is generally recognized upon shipment  as the company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date 
revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and where persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred  and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible 
revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support  training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
extended maintenance plan revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the plan 
the company warrants its products against defects in design  materials and workmanship for one year 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped 
costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as incurred 
revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of the company s historical technology for medical applications is recognized when the technology is used by the licensees 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory since the value of inventory that will ultimately be realized cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts to provide a basis for the determination of the reserve 
inventory is considered obsolete if the company has withdrawn those products from the market or had no sales of the product for the past months and has no sales forecasted for the next months 
inventory is considered excess if the quantity on hand exceeds months of remaining usage 
the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists 
items without an identified current or future usage are reserved in an amount equal to of the fifo cost of such inventory 
the company s products are subject to changes in technologies that may make certain of its products or their components obsolete or less competitive  which may increase its historical provisions to the reserve 
income taxes the company reviews its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income over a two year period  and tax planning strategies that it might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence of recoverability  the company establishes a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which it operates  unless it is more likely than not that it will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  the company s evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by its ability to achieve profitability and its ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company establishes provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as described by asc  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the ordinary course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
the company assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that gave rise to a revision become known 

table of contents reserve for warranties the company establishes at the time of sale a liability for the one year warranty included with the initial purchase price of equipment  based upon an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the warranty period 
the warranty period is measured in installation months for each major product group 
the warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by applying the actual total repair expenses for each product group in the prior period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
this repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation months of warranty for each product group to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company evaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of units remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each unit will be under warranty 
the company has a history of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  which may result in unforeseen issues that increase its warranty costs 
while such expenses have historically been within expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
indefinite life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment 
the company performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the company believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary 
the company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
if necessary  the goodwill impairment test is applied using a two step approach 
in performing the first step  the company calculates the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows dcf of each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair market value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the first step  less the fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit other than goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
management has concluded there was no goodwill impairment in the years ended december   and impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements  including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  of its revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of its non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 
the company is aware of the availability of off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  including cross currency swaps  forward contracts and foreign currency options 
however  it does not regularly use such instruments  and none were utilized in  or
