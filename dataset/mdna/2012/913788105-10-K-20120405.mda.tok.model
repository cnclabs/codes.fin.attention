we acquired pti in april pti specializes in designing and assembling custom lithium ion battery packs 
the acquisition expands our battery solutions offerings and adds technical capabilities to grow this aspect of our business in new markets including computers  camcorders  tools  medical equipment  military applications  metering  mining and handheld communications equipment 
pti also holds several iso certifications required by medical and other specialized battery pack buyers 
we believe that these synergies will result in additional opportunities to grow this aspect of our business 
the acquisition consideration totaled million  including million in cash  million in notes payable to pti  and the assumption of million in notes payable to third parties 
the acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting  under which we allocated the aggregate purchase price including liabilities assumed to tangible  identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their fair values on the closing date  and the excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the amount allocated to goodwill was million as a result of the supply chain disruptions we experienced in  we accelerated our efforts to identify and establish new supplier relationships in and outside of china to better mitigate the risks 
these efforts have thus far yielded positive results and we believe that we are in a better position to withstand supply chain disruptions and meet the needs of our customers 
however  our efforts in this regard are ongoing and we do not expect to shipments of batteries and other products to return to their and early levels until the third quarter of we are actively and cautiously evaluating new markets  strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities that facilitate reaching our strategic growth objectives 
while we are optimistic  we remain conservative on this front due to the soft economy 
we continue to make the necessary investments to support and facilitate our immediate and long term growth objectives 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december the following table compares our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december  and the trends suggested by this table may not be indicative of future operating results  which will depend on various factors including the nature of revenues sales of batteries and other power accessory products versus logistics or value added services and the relative mix of products sold batteries versus other power supply products  as well as the state of the general economy 
in addition  acquisitions could also affect our operating results in future periods

in december  our board of directors approved a proposal to offer all of our officers  directors and employees who hold unexercised options with an exercise price in excess of of the trading price of a share of our common stock the opportunity to re price those options at market 
in consideration  the option holder would have to agree that of his or her options would not be exercisable until december  all of the option holders accepted this offer and  as a result  the exercise price of  options was re set to

in comparison  net cash used in investing activities for was million for net cash used by financing activities for was million  of which million was used to reduce the balance on our line of credit and million was used to reduce outstanding balances on capital lease and note obligations 
in comparison  net cash used in financing activities for was million 
we have a revolving credit agreement with wells fargo that terminates on july  the credit agreement provides that we may borrow up to million  with the possibility that we can increase the line to million if we can satisfy certain defined criteria 
all of our assets secure our obligations under the credit agreement 
our borrowing availability is limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as those terms are defined in the credit agreement 
for each borrowing  we have the option to choose a base rate  or eurodollar  loan 
interest on base rate loans is payable quarterly and interest on eurodollar loans is generally payable monthly or quarterly at our option 
the annual rate of interest payable on base rate and eurodollar loans fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  all as described in the credit agreement 
at december   the interest rate was 
the credit agreement contains negative covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions without wells fargo s consent  including incurring additional indebtedness  transferring or encumbering assets  paying dividends or making certain other payments  and acquiring other businesses 
if there is an event of default  including failure to pay  bankruptcy  breach of covenants and breach of representations and warranties  all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will become immediately due and payable 
in addition  we must maintain certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility out of a maximum availability of approximately million based on the borrowing formula 
in connection with refinancing our line of credit in december  the interest swap agreement we had entered into with compass bank  our previous lender  in june was terminated 
the swap agreement had locked in a fixed rate of on the first million outstanding under the line of credit  thus swapping the fixed rate for the current variable rate as calculated under the original loan agreement with compass bank through its maturity date of july  the interest rate swap was accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge and the unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of the termination of the interest swap agreement  we discontinued hedge accounting on december  the de designation of cash flow hedges requires that the net derivative gain or loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedge should continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we continue to incur interest expense commensurate with our original  hedged risk  and there is currently no indication that interest payments on the hedged transaction would not continue 
therefore  the realized loss related to this derivative will not be recognized immediately and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these losses are reclassified into earnings over the contractual terms of the swap agreement starting as of december  capital resources at december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we may enter into various commitments during if expansion opportunities arise 
we will disclose material items in press releases and other appropriate filings as they develop 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
international currency fluctuation the goods that we purchase from asia are subject to international currency fluctuations 
we do not believe that the fluctuation in currency presents a serious threat to its operations 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we are a distributor who purchases both finished goods and components from domestic and international suppliers 
we add value to products and components by packaging them in customer specified kits or tailor made units that are convenient for the customer to order and ship 
additionally  we have several customers that require specific battery pack assemblies 
we obtain batteries and components and reconfigure finished goods based upon customer specifications 
we refer to this process as battery pack assemblies 
we recognize sales of finished goods at the time the customer takes title to the product 
we sell products to several customers in bulk quantities 
we obtain the order from the customer and arrange for the delivery of the product directly from our vendor to the customer to reduce freight costs and wear and tear on the product from excessive handling 
we refer to these transactions as drop shipments because the product is shipped directly from our vendor to our customer 
revenues from drop shipment transactions are recognized on a gross basis at the time the customer takes title to the product 
income taxes our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including our income tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 
we use significant judgment and estimates in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense 
as a result  the tax rate reflected in our tax return our current tax rate is different from the tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  while other differences are temporary as they reverse over time 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases 
we establish valuation allowances when we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in future taxable income  tax liabilities and our tax planning strategies may affect our effective tax rate  valuation allowances and the associated carrying value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at any one time  our tax returns for various tax years are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing jurisdictions 
we establish tax liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  also codified under asc asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent  our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based on management s assessment  we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance 
balances that remains outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods  primarily of batteries and security products related to the company s third party fulfillment services and materials used in the assembly of batteries into packs 
all items are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the average cost method by specific item  or market 
the company performs periodic evaluations  based upon business trends  to identify specifically obsolete  slow moving and non salable inventory 
stock based compensation we account for stock options under accounting provisions that require the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under these fair value recognition provisions  we estimate stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards  which requires various judgmental assumptions  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
in addition  we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures and expected life  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
