we expect the cash needs for sabine pass lng s operating activities for at least the next twelve months will be met through operating cash flows and existing unrestricted cash 
we expect the cash needs for cheniere partners operating activities for at least the next twelve months will be met through operating cash flows from sabine pass lng and existing unrestricted cash 
we expect the cash needs of cheniere s operating activities for at least the next twelve months will be met by utilizing existing unrestricted cash  management fees from sabine pass lng and cheniere partners  distributions from our investment in cheniere partners and operating cash flows from our pipeline and lng and natural gas marketing businesses 
the following table presents in thousands cheniere s restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents for each portion of our capital structure as of december  all restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by cheniere partners and sabine pass lng are considered restricted as to usage or withdrawal by cheniere sabine pass lng cheniere partners other cheniere consolidated cheniere cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and cash equivalents total all cash and cash equivalents presented above for sabine pass lng are considered restricted to us  but million is considered unrestricted for sabine pass lng 
all cash and cash equivalents presented above for cheniere partners are considered restricted to us  but million is considered unrestricted for cheniere partners  including the million considered unrestricted for sabine pass lng 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million available to cheniere 
in addition  we had consolidated restricted cash and cash equivalents of million which included cash and cash equivalents and other working capital available to cheniere partners  in which we own an interest  and sabine pass lng designated for the following purposes million for interest payments related to the senior notes described below  million for sabine pass lng s working capital  million for cheniere partners working capital  and million for other restricted purposes 
during the second quarter of  we reclassified million of debt from a long term liability to a current liability because our term loan described below was due within months as of may  during the third quarter of  we reclassified million  net of discount  of debt from a long term liability to a current liability because our convertible senior unsecured notes were due within months as of august  in december  we closed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  which were sold to the public at a price per share of  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million

as of december   we had sold million shares with net proceeds of million 
during the year ended december   we paid million in commissions to miller tabak co  inc  as sales agent  in connection with the at the market program 
we believe that we will have sufficient unrestricted cash  liquid assets  cash generated from our operations and proceeds from capital market transactions to satisfy our debt obligations and fund our operations for at least the next months 
in order to satisfy our principal payment due on our convertible senior unsecured notes in august  we will need to extend  refinance or repay such indebtedness  which may be accomplished by refinancing our existing indebtedness  raising capital by issuing equity  debt or other securities or using cash generated from selling assets or through a combination of the foregoing and will be dependent on factors such as worldwide natural gas and capital market conditions 
lng terminal business cheniere partners our ownership interest in the sabine pass lng terminal is held through cheniere partners 
we own approximately of cheniere partners in the form of million common units  million subordinated units and a general partner interest 
cheniere partners owns a interest in sabine pass lng  which is operating the sabine pass lng terminal  and a interest in sabine pass liquefaction  which is developing a liquefaction project at the sabine pass lng terminal 
we receive quarterly equity distributions from cheniere partners  and we receive management fees for managing sabine pass lng and cheniere partners 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions on our common units  no distributions on our subordinated units and million in distributions on our general partner interest 
during the year ended december   we received fees of million and million under our management agreements with cheniere partners and sabine pass lng  respectively 
cheniere partners common unit and general partner distributions are being funded from cash flows generated by sabine pass lng s two third party tua customers 
the subordinated unit distributions that we received in were funded from cash flows generated by sabine pass lng s tua with cheniere marketing 
effective july   cheniere marketing assigned its tua with sabine pass lng for bcf d of regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal to cheniere energy investments  llc cheniere investments  a wholly owned subsidiary of cheniere partners 
as a result of cheniere marketing s assignment of its tua to cheniere investments  we have not received distributions on our subordinated units since the distribution made with respect to the quarter ended march  during the subordination period  the common units have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the initial quarterly distribution of per quarter  plus any arrearages in the payment of the initial quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units that we own 
as a result of cheniere marketing s assignment of its tua to cheniere investments  cheniere marketing no longer makes the approximately million per year of payments to sabine pass lng  and cheniere partners will not make distributions on our subordinated units unless it generates additional cash flow from sabine pass lng s excess capacity or new business 
therefore  distributions to us on our subordinated units and conversion of the subordinated units into common units will depend upon the future business development of cheniere partners 
we expect that additional cash flows generated by cheniere partners proposed liquefaction project or other new cheniere partners business would be used to make quarterly distributions on our subordinated units before any increase in distributions to the common unitholders 
we and cheniere partners amended  effective as of july   the fee structure for the various general and administrative services provided by us for cheniere partners benefit and changed it from a fixed fee to a variable fee 
the amended and restated services agreement provides that fees will be paid quarterly from cheniere partners unrestricted cash and cash equivalents remaining after making distributions to the common unitholders and the general partner in respect of each quarter and retaining certain reserves 
our ability to receive management fees from cheniere partners is dependent on our ability to  among other things  manage cheniere partners and sabine pass lng s operating and administrative expenses  monetize the bcf d of regasification capacity under the cheniere investments tua as discussed below and develop new projects through either internal development or acquisition to increase cash flow 
the fixed management fees payable by sabine pass lng remain unchanged 
concurrently with the tua assignment  cheniere investments entered into a variable capacity rights agreement vcra with cheniere marketing 
under the terms of the vcra  cheniere marketing is responsible for monetizing cheniere investments tua capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal and is obligated to pay cheniere investments of the expected gross margin of each cargo of lng it arranges for delivery to the sabine pass lng terminal 
to the extent payments from cheniere marketing to cheniere investments under the vcra or new cheniere partners business increase cheniere partners available cash in excess of the common unit and general partner distributions and certain reserves  the cash would be distributed to us in the form of distributions on our subordinated units and related general partner distributions 
during the term of the vcra  cheniere marketing is responsible for the payment of taxes and new regulatory costs under cheniere investments tua 
cheniere has guaranteed all of cheniere marketing s payment obligations under the vcra 
in january  cheniere partners initiated an at the market program to sell up to million common units  the proceeds from which are used primarily to fund development costs associated with its proposed liquefaction project at the sabine pass lng terminal 
as of december   cheniere partners had sold million common units with net proceeds of million 
in september  cheniere partners sold million common units in an underwritten public offering and million common units to cheniere common units holding  llc at a price of per common unit 
cheniere partners received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering that it is using for general business purposes  including development costs associated with its proposed liquefaction project at the sabine pass lng terminal 
sabine pass lng terminal approximately bcf d of regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal has been reserved under two long term third party tuas  under which sabine pass lng s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees  whether or not they use the lng terminal 
capacity reservation fee tua payments are made by sabine pass lng s third party tua customers as follows total gas and power north america  inc total has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years that commenced april  total  sa has guaranteed total s obligations under its tua up to billion  subject to certain exceptions  and chevron usa inc chevron has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years that commenced july  chevron corporation has guaranteed chevron s obligations under its tua up to of the fees payable by chevron 
each of total and chevron previously paid sabine pass lng million in nonrefundable advance capacity reservation fees  which are being amortized over a year period as a reduction of each customer s regasification capacity reservation fees payable under its respective tua 
the remaining approximately bcf d of regasification capacity has been reserved by cheniere partners through a tua between cheniere investments and sabine pass lng 
cheniere investments is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year through at least september   however  the revenue earned by sabine pass lng from cheniere investments capacity payments under the tua is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
under each of these tuas  sabine pass lng is entitled to retain of the lng delivered for the customer s account 
cheniere partners is also developing proposed liquefaction facilities at the sabine pass lng terminal 
as currently contemplated  the liquefaction facilities are designed for up to four lng trains  each with a nominal production capacity of approximately mtpa 
we expect to commence construction of lng trains and during the first half of and begin operations in  with each lng train commencing operations approximately six to nine months after the previous lng train 
we estimate that the aggregate total cost to complete construction of the proposed liquefaction facilities will be approximately billion to billion  before financing costs 
our cost estimates are subject to change due to such items as change orders  increased component and material costs  escalation of labor costs and increased spending to maintain our construction schedule 
in november  sabine pass liquefaction entered into a lump sum turnkey epc agreement with bechtel for construction of lng trains and of the liquefaction project for billion 
the contract price is only subject to adjustment by change order  including by bechtel if it is adversely affected as a result of a delay in the commencement of construction beyond march  as of december   cheniere partners had paid million of development costs relating to the proposed liquefaction facilities using its cash from operations and equity proceeds from the issuance of million common units in september we expect to finance the construction costs of the proposed liquefaction project from a combination of project financing and debt and equity offerings 
other lng terminals we will contemplate making final investment decisions to construct our proposed corpus christi lng terminal and any other lng terminal project upon  among other things  entering into acceptable commercial and financing arrangements for the applicable project 
natural gas pipeline business the creole trail pipeline  consisting of miles of natural gas pipeline  is currently in service and operating 
cheniere marketing and other third parties have entered into interruptible transportation agreements with creole trail pipeline to transport natural gas from the sabine pass lng terminal into north american natural gas markets 
although cheniere marketing and other third parties have entered into interruptible transportation agreements with creole trail pipeline to transport natural gas from the sabine pass lng terminal into north american natural gas markets  there are no significant cash flows generated from the creole trail pipeline 
in connection with cheniere partners proposed liquefaction facilities at the sabine pass lng terminal  we are developing a project to add additional capabilities to the creole trail pipeline to be able to provide transportation services to the liquefaction facilities 
we will contemplate making a final investment decision to construct the remaining miles of the creole trail pipeline  the corpus christi pipeline  the cheniere southern trail pipeline and the burgos hub project upon  among other things  receiving all required authorizations to construct and operate the applicable pipeline and storage facility in the case of the burgos hub project  to the extent not already obtained  and entering into acceptable commercial and financing arrangements for the applicable project 
we do not expect to spend significant funds on these projects in the near term 
lng and natural gas marketing business the accounting treatment for lng inventory differs from the treatment for derivative positions such that the economics of cheniere marketing s activities are not transparent in our consolidated financial statements until all lng inventory is sold and all derivative positions are settled 
our lng inventory is recorded as an asset at cost and is subject to lower of cost or market lcm adjustments at the end of each reporting period 
the lcm adjustment market price is based on period end natural gas spot prices  and any gain or loss from an lcm adjustment is recorded in our earnings at the end of each period 
revenue and cost of goods sold are not recognized in our earnings until the lng is sold 
generally  our unrealized derivatives positions at the end of each period extend into the future to hedge the cash flow from future sales of our lng inventory or to take market positions and hedge exposure associated with lng and natural gas 
these positions are measured at fair value  and we record the gains and losses from the change in their fair value currently in earnings 
thus  earnings from changes in the fair value of our derivatives may not be offset by losses from lcm adjustments to our lng inventory because the lcm adjustments that may be made to lng inventory are based on period end spot prices that are different from the time periods of the prices used to fair value our derivatives 
any losses from changes in the fair value of our derivatives will not be offset by gains until the lng is actually sold 
lngco agreements in  cheniere marketing entered into various agreements lngco agreements with jpmorgan lng co 
lngco under which cheniere marketing has agreed to develop and maintain commercial and trading opportunities in the lng industry and present any such opportunities exclusively to lngco 
cheniere marketing also agreed to provide  or arrange for the provision of  all of the operations and administrative services required by lngco in connection with any lng cargoes purchased by lngco  including negotiating agreements and arranging for transporting  receiving  storing  hedging and regasifying lng cargoes 
cheniere marketing does not have the authority to contractually bind lngco under the lngco agreements 
in the event lngco declines to purchase an lng cargo presented to it by cheniere marketing under the lngco agreements  cheniere marketing may pursue the opportunity on its own behalf or present it to third parties 
the term of the lngco agreements expires in april  however  either party may terminate the agreements without penalty prior to such date 
in return for the services to be provided by cheniere marketing  lngco will pay a fixed fee to cheniere marketing and may pay additional fees depending upon the gross margins of each transaction and the aggregate gross margin earned during the term of the lngco agreements 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of marketing and trading revenues from lngco 
as of december   the carrying amount of cheniere marketing s assets relating to lngco  which is equivalent to cheniere marketing s maximum exposure to loss  was million 
a portion of this million represents our fixed fee receivable and is reported as accounts and interest receivable on our consolidated financial statements  and the remaining portion represents our margin deposit receivable and is reported as prepaid expense and other current assets on our consolidated financial statements and is to be paid to cheniere marketing upon the completion or termination of the lngco agreements

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to apply the accounting rules to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we endeavor to comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe that the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
accounting for lng activities generally  we begin capitalizing the costs of our lng terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria i regulatory approval has been received  ii financing for the project is available and iii management has committed to commence construction 
prior to meeting these criteria  most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work  costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals  and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng terminals and related pipelines 
generally  costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land and lease option costs that are capitalized as property  plant and equipment and certain permits that are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
the costs of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once obtained 
if no lease is obtained  the costs are expensed 
we capitalize interest and other related debt costs during the construction period of our lng terminal 
upon commencement of operations  capitalized interest  as a component of the total cost  will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity reservation fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred and amortized over a year period as a reduction of a customer s regasification capacity reservation fees payable under its tua 
the retained of lng delivered for each customer s account at the sabine pass lng terminal is recognized as revenues as sabine pass lng performs the services set forth in each customer s tua 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
estimates used in the assessment of impairment of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are the most significant of our estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future cash flows of assets or business segments 
the accuracy of any cash flow estimate is a function of judgment used in determining the amount of cash flows generated 
as a result  cash flows may be different from the cash flows that we use to assess impairment of our assets 
management reviews its estimates of cash flows on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic and commodity price environment 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock  reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business segments or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance 
projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results 
in addition  if our analysis results in an impairment of our long lived assets  including goodwill  we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
other items subject to estimates and assumptions include asset retirement obligations  valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets  valuations of derivative instruments  valuations of noncash compensation and collectability of accounts receivable and other assets 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined accurately  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
lng and natural gas marketing we have determined that our lng and natural gas marketing business activities are energy trading and risk management activities for trading purposes and have elected to present these activities on a net basis on our consolidated statements of operations 
marketing and trading revenues represent the margin earned on the purchase and transportation of lng purchases and subsequent sales of natural gas to third parties 
these energy trading and risk management activities include  but are not limited to purchase of lng and natural gas  transportation contracts  and derivatives 
below is a brief description of our accounting treatment of each type of energy trading and risk management activity and how we account for it purchase of lng and natural gas the purchase value of lng or natural gas inventory is recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets at the cost to acquire the product 
our inventory is subject to lower of cost or market adjustment each quarter 
recoveries of losses resulting from interim period lower of cost or market adjustments are made due to market price recoveries on the same inventory in the same fiscal year and are recognized as gains in later interim periods with such gains not exceeding previously recognized losses 
any adjustment to our inventory is recorded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
transportation contracts we enter into transportation contracts with respect to the transport of lng or natural gas to a specific location for storage or sale 
transportation costs that are incurred during the purchase of lng or natural gas are capitalized as part of the acquisition costs of the product 
transportation costs incurred to sell lng or natural gas are recorded on a net basis as lng and natural gas marketing revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
derivatives we use derivative instruments from time to time to hedge cash flows attributable to the future sale of lng inventory and to hedge the price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal 
we have disclosed certain information regarding these derivative positions  including the fair value of our derivative positions  in 
note financial instruments of our notes to consolidated financial statements gains and losses in positions to hedge the cash flows attributable to the future sale of lng inventory are classified as marketing and trading revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
gains or losses in the positions to mitigate the price risk from future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal are classified as derivative gain loss  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
we record changes in the fair value of our derivative positions on our consolidated statements of operations based on the value for which the derivative instrument could be exchanged between willing parties 
to date  all of our derivative positions fair value determinations have been made by management using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities 
the ultimate fair value of our derivative instruments is uncertain  and we believe that it is possible that a change in the estimated fair value will occur in the near future as commodity prices change 
regulated natural gas pipelines our natural gas pipeline business is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc in accordance with the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of the economic effects of regulation can result in a regulated company recording as assets those costs that have been or are expected to be approved for recovery from customers  or recording as liabilities those amounts that are expected to be required to be returned to customers  in a rate setting process in a period different from the period in which the amounts would be recorded by an unregulated enterprise 
accordingly  we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated rate making process that may not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
we continually assess whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities 
based on this continual assessment  we believe the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
these regulatory assets and liabilities are primarily classified in the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities 
we periodically evaluate their applicability under gaap  and consider factors such as regulatory changes and the effect of competition 
if cost based regulation ends or competition increases  we may have to reduce our asset balances to reflect a market basis less than cost and write off the associated regulatory assets and liabilities 
items that may influence our assessment are inability to recover cost increases due to rate caps and rate case moratoriums  inability to recover capitalized costs  including an adequate return on those costs through the rate making process and the ferc proceedings  excess capacity  increased competition and discounting in the markets we serve  and impacts of ongoing regulatory initiatives in the natural gas industry 
natural gas pipeline costs include amounts capitalized as an allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
the rates used in the calculation of afudc are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the ferc 
afudc represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance our natural gas pipeline additions during construction 
afudc is capitalized as a part of the cost of our natural gas pipelines 
under regulatory rate practices  we generally are permitted to recover afudc  and a fair return thereon  through our rate base after our natural gas pipelines are placed in service 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses acquired 
it is evaluated annually for impairment by first comparing our management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
we had goodwill of million at december  and  attributable to our lng terminal segment 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year  although we may perform a goodwill impairment review more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as discussed above regarding our use of estimates  our judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management s estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit s fair value 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that implied volatility  calculated based on traded options of our common stock  combined with historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends 
therefore  the expected volatility for the years ended december  and used in our fair value model was based on a combination of implied and historical volatilities 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  future share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see 
note share based compensation of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended current comprehensive income guidance 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
also  in december  fasb issued an accounting standard update to abrogate the requirement for presentation in the income statement of the effect on net income of reclassification adjustments out of aoci as required in fasb s june amendment 
we expect to adopt this guidance in our first fiscal quarter ending march  the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
in september  the fasb amended the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance in our fourth fiscal quarter ended december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investments we have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital 
such cash investments are stated at historical cost  which approximates fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
marketing and trading commodity price risk we have entered into certain derivative instruments to economically hedge the price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate the sabine pass lng terminal fuel derivatives and to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our lng inventory lng inventory derivatives 
we use one day value at risk var with a confidence interval and other methodologies for market risk measurement and control purposes 
the var is calculated using the monte carlo simulation method
