overview zion oil is an initial stage oil and gas exploration company with a history of over years of oil and gas exploration in israel 
as of december   we have no revenues or operating income and are considered to be an exploration stage company 
we are headquartered in dallas  texas and have a field office in caesarea  israel 
we hold three petroleum exploration licenses  named the joseph license  the asher menashe license and the jordan valley license  covering approximately  acres of land onshore northern israel 
to date  we have completed drilling three exploratory wells and have partly completed drilling one exploratory well in the asher menashe license area 
we currently have pending before the petroleum commissioner of the state of israel the commissioner applications for one exploration license and two preliminary exploration permits 
the exploration license was submitted in february for an area covering approximately  acres of land within the vicinity of the dead sea  in central israel  which we have named the dead sea license application 
at the same time  we submitted the first of the two applications for preliminary exploration permits described above 
the permit that would result from this first application would cover part of the area previously covered by our previous issachar zebulun permit  which expired on february  much of the remainder of the area covered by such permit is included in our recently granted jordan valley license 
we named the new permit application the zebulun permit application 
it covers approximately  acres of land 
in june  we submitted the second of two applications for preliminary exploration permits described above 
this application was for a preliminary exploration permit on an area adjacent to our joseph license area 
we named the new permit application the asher joseph permit application 
the asher joseph permit application area is on approximately  acres of land and is to the west and south of zion s joseph license area 
it is onshore israel and traverses a section of land  adjacent to the coastline  between haifa and tel aviv 
no assurance can be provided that any of the dead sea license application  the zebulun permit application or asher joseph permit application will ultimately be granted 
current exploration efforts and financing we are currently in the process of identifying our next drilling prospect 
we plan to acquire additional geological and geophysical data in the jordan valley license area within the first or second quarter of and additional geological and geophysical data  including a vertical seismic profile  in the asher menashe license area  once an appropriate rig and related equipment becomes available  which we expect will be in the second quarter of once we complete the processing and interpretation of the results of this data  we anticipate that we will be able to identify our next exploratory drilling prospect 
currently  we anticipate that our next drilling prospect will be in either the asher menashe license area or the jordan valley license area 
once we identify our drilling prospect  we will need to work towards the completion of the permitting process 
we also need to finalize arrangements for a drilling rig and experienced drilling crew 
while we have been in discussion with an appropriate rig owner  as of now we have not yet entered into any legally binding documents 
subject to finalizing drilling arrangements and importing into israel and appropriate rig and completing the permitting process  we currently estimate that we will not be in a position to commence drilling before the third quarter of these are estimated time frames based on the information available to us and are accordingly subject to change 
we anticipate that we will need to raise significant funds in order to complete any exploratory well that we spud 
we anticipate that we will need to raise these funds in to date  we have funded our operations through the issuance of our securities 
we anticipate that we will need to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities 
no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in raising the needed equity on terms favorable to use or at all 
our recent financings are discussed below 
between october  and january   we raised from a follow on public offering gross proceeds of  from the sale of units of our securities  of which  was for debt conversion 
each unit offered in the follow on offering consisted of i one share of common stock  par value 
per share and ii one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a per share exercise price equal to trading under the symbol znwaw 
the znwaw warrants expire on december  in june  we raised gross proceeds of million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in november  we raised an additional million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in july  we raised approximately million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering resulted in our distribution of  shares 
in december  we raised approximately million from a fourth rights offering to common stockholders of up to  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was subscribed for a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants trading under the symbol znwaz to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
the znwaz warrants expire on december  in july  we raised approximately million from an additional rights offering to common stockholders of up to  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was subscribed for a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock trading under the symbol znwal 
the znwal warrants expire on august  between january  and february   we raised approximately  from the exercise of our publicly traded warrants trading under the symbol znwaw 
we reduced the exercise price of these warrants  for a limited time period extending from january  through march   to from an original per share exercise price of 
in december  we extended the exercise period of the znwaw warrants to december  in addition  between january  to february   we raised approximately  from the exercise of the znwaz warrants 
in addition  between august  to february   we raised approximately  from the exercise of the znwal warrants 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following impairment of unproved oil and gas properties impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be able to be commercially productive 
the amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to israeli regulatory authorities 
general and administrative expenses overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of managing our exploratory operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense also includes non cash stock based compensation expense  investor relations related expenses  lease and insurance and related expenses 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration  and apportion these costs to each unit of production  if any  through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
as we have yet to have production  the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool 
going concern basis our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
since we are in the development stage  we have limited capital resources  no revenue to date and a loss from operations 
the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and  ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
the uncertainty of these conditions in the past has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
impairment of oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit of production method 
our oil and gas properties represent an investment in unproved properties 
these costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is amend charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established 
a further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves  together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations 
in july  following production and other testing conducted at the ma anit joseph well  we conducted an open hole drill stem test and the test results confirmed that the well does not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the zone tested 
following review and further analysis of the operations and geological reports prepared by our geoscientists in consultation with outside consultants relating to the drilling and testing of the ma anit joseph well  it was determined that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not present in the ma anit joseph well or the elijah well 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  in the quarter ended september  to our unproved oil and gas properties in respect of the two wells 
in order to identify potential drilling prospects in the asher menashe license area  we plan to enter into the elijah wellbore to acquire additional geologic and geophysical data  including a vertical seismic profile 
we anticipate that suitable drilling equipment and crew will become available for these purposes in may june abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves  together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations 
in june  following the analysis of the results of the testing of our ma anit well workover and an evaluation of the mechanical condition of the well  we determined that the well was incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities 
in order to optimize drilling operations on the company s planned ma anit rehoboth well  we ceased operations on the ma anit well and  as required by the petroleum law  formally relinquished the ma anit joseph license 
as planned  we used the ma anit wellbore  down to approximately  feet  meters  as the upper part of the wellbore for the ma anit rehoboth well 
this well was directionally drilled from that point to penetrate the middle and the lower triassic 
the company drilled this well to a depth of  meters  feet 
in april  following production and other testing  management concluded that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons were not present in the ma anit rehoboth well 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  in the quarter ended june  to its unproved oil and gas properties 
following the impairment charges noted above  the total net book value of our unproved oil and gas properties under the full cost method is  at december  although our oil gas properties and our principal operations are in israel  we report all our transactions in united states dollars 
certain dollar amounts in the financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies 
valuation of deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe is likely to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would  in the future  realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made 
in the period that such a determination was made  the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income 
asset retirement obligation we record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st 
all data is in thousands of usd general and administrative expenses legal and professional  salaries    other    impairment of unproved oil and gas properties   other income expense  net net loss    for the year ended december  compared to december  revenue 
we currently have no revenue generating operations as we are still a development stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the impairment charge of  recorded during the three months ended september  in respect of both the ma anit joseph well and the elijah well 
salary expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in salary expenses during is mainly attributable to  in non cash expenses related to the grant of incentive options 
these options were granted by the board to ensure the retention of key members of both management and staff and to ensure that the interests of management were aligned with the interests of stockholders 
the remainder of the increase in salary expenses is attributable to the expansion of staff to support operations 
legal and professional fees for were  compared to  for the increase in legal and professional fees is primarily attributable to the increased utilization of legal services resulting from the increase in operational activity in the first half of other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the  increase in other general and administrative expenses  which is comprised of non compensation  non professional and non operational expenses incurred in our offices  is primarily attributable to drilling and production related expenses that we recorded in the fourth quarter of in the amount of  following the recording of the impairment charge during the quarter ended september  and investor relations related expenses in the amount of  other income expense  net 
other income expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income loss  net is primarily attributable to currency exchange losses generated by exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar to the new israeli shekel during net loss

the increase in other general and administrative expenses  which is comprised of non compensation  non professional and non operational expenses incurred in our three offices  is primarily attributable to an increase in marketing and investor relations related expenses  and in insurance related expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income  net is attributable to the reduction in the rate of interest offered on cash deposits by financial institutions 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
as discussed above  we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to undertake further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future 
our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements 
should those estimates be materially incorrect  our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these matters may raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  at december  our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  at december  and  at december  during the year ended december   we recorded expenses paid  relating to the rights offering completed in july  in the amount of  net cash provided by financing activities was  net cash used for investment in our unproved oil and gas properties was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   these amounts were primarily drilling related expenditures 
we expect to incur expenditures to further our exploration programs 
we estimate that  when we are not actively drilling a well  our monthly expenditure is approximately  per month 
however  when we are engaged in active drilling operations  we estimate that there is an additional cost of approximately  per month 
the drilling cost estimates are subject to change and we have not  as of march   finalized the terms relating to a drilling rig  appropriate crew and related matters 
assuming that we spud our next exploratory well in october november  of which no assurance can be provided  management believes that our existing cash balance will be sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and satisfy our exploration budget through december  we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital but to date have made no specific plans or arrangements 
as of march   we are unable to state the amount of any funds that will be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities  debt or other financing arrangements 
we are unable to estimate the terms on which such capital will be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved or the terms of any agreements to raise capital under other arrangements 
because of the early stage of our operations and our lack of any oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration  appraisal and development expenditures 
as of february   we have outstanding publicly listed warrants for  shares of our common stock exercisable through december  the znwaw warrants at a per share exercise price of  there are additional publicly listed warrants for  shares of our common stock exercisable through december  the znwaz warrants at a per share exercise price of  and additional publicly listed warrants for  shares of our common stock exercisable through august  the znwal warrants at a per share exercise price of 
if all of these warrants are exercised for cash  of which no assurance can be provided  then we would received cash proceeds of  in order to increase the likelihood of these warrants being exercised  the stock price of our publicly traded common stock will need to remain above the exercise prices 
as of march   the stock price of our publicly traded common stock is below these exercise prices 
no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise any significant funds from the exercises of these warrants 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  we believe that drilling related commitments will be a principal component of our contractual obligation over the next several years 
however  we are currently in the process of acquiring and interpreting seismic and other non drilling related exploratory tests in order to identify our next drilling prospect 
we are also in discussion with various drilling rig operators in order to identify and bring into israel a drilling rig with the appropriate drilling depth capacity 
once we finalize our drilling plans and enter into appropriate agreements with drilling rig operators  which we anticipate will take place by the fourth quarter of  we will be able to accurately assess our drilling related obligation going forward 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at december  and their future maturities 
payment due by period in thousands of usd thereafter total drilling commitments  operating leases employment agreements total   off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
recently issued accounting pronouncements during  there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements which were issued and which have relevancy to our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and or equity prices 
in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risks 
a portion of our expenses  primarily labor expenses and certain supplier contracts  are nominated in new israeli shekels nis 
as a result  we have significant exposure to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates with the us dollar  our primary reporting currency 
the recent weakness of the us dollar in the international markets has been equally reflected against nis and this may continue in the future 
since december    and to february   the us dollar has devalued by approximately  and respectively against the nis 
continuing devaluation of the us dollar against the nis will result in higher operating costs from nis denominated expenses 
we do not currently hedge against currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio of short term bank deposits and money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of approximately  the weighted average annual interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was approximately 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in short term bank deposits and money market funds that may invest in high quality debt instruments
