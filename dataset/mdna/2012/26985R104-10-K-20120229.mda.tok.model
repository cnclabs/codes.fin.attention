table of contents non gaap financial measures we include in this report adjusted ebitda  which does not comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
we provide reconciliations of this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measures as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus or minus income tax provision benefit  interest net  including realized interest rate risk management instruments and other expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  impairment expense  other operating expense  non recurring  other non cash operating and general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation related to our equity based compensation program  unrealized gains losses on commodity and interest rate risk management related instruments  gains losses on discontinued operations and other income expense 
we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of our core profitability to assess the financial performance of our assets 
adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental financial measure by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts 
for example  the compliance covenant used by our lenders under our revolving credit facility which is designed to measure our viability and our ability to perform under the terms of our revolving credit facility uses adjusted ebitda 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management team uses in evaluating performance 
adjusted ebitda is useful in determining our ability to sustain or increase distributions 
by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  a non cash  mark to market benefit charge which represents the change in fair market value of our executed derivative instruments and is independent of our assets performance or cash flow generating ability  we believe adjusted ebitda reflects more accurately our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our level of indebtedness  make cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner and finance our maintenance capital expenditures 
we further believe that adjusted ebitda also describes more accurately the underlying performance of our operating assets by isolating the performance of our operating assets from the impact of an unrealized  non cash measure designed to describe the fluctuating inherent value of a financial asset 
similarly  by excluding the impact of non recurring discontinued operations  adjusted ebitda provides users of our financial statements a more accurate picture of our current assets cash generation ability  independently from that of assets which are no longer a part of our operations 
our adjusted ebitda definition may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures of other entities  as other entities may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner as us 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions occasionally undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase puts or other similar floors  despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts 
adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes or depreciation and amortization expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate net income 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is important to consider both net income loss and net cash flows provided by operating activities determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our performance and liquidity 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with us gaap

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a domestically focused  growth oriented  publicly traded delaware limited partnership engaged in the following two businesses midstream business gathering  compressing  treating  processing  transporting  marketing and trading natural gas  fractionating  transporting and marketing natural gas liquids ngls  and crude oil logistics and marketing  and upstream business developing and producing oil and natural gas property interests 
during the fourth quarter of  our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker decided that due to the relative size of the east texas louisiana  south texas and gulf of mexico segments  these three reporting segments would be collapsed into a single reporting segment and that a new marketing and trading reporting segment would be created 
the midstream business s financial results are now reported in the following segments i texas panhandle  which no longer includes the results of our marketing and trading operations  ii east texas and other midstream  which consolidates our former east texas louisiana  south texas and gulf of mexico segments  and iii marketing and trading  which is a new reporting segment 
operating results for the reportable segments have been recast for the years ending december  and to reflect these changes 
our upstream segment and functional corporate segment remained unchanged from what has been previously reported 
we conduct  evaluate and report on our midstream business within three distinct segments the texas panhandle segment  the east texas and other midstream segment  and the marketing and trading segment 
our texas panhandle segment consists of gathering and processing assets in the texas panhandle 
our east texas and other midstream segment consists of gathering and processing assets in east texas northern louisiana  south texas  southern louisiana  the gulf of mexico and galveston bay 
our marketing and trading segment consists of crude oil logistics and marketing in texas and alabama  and natural gas marketing and trading 
during the year ended december   our midstream business generated operating income from continuing operations of million compared to operating income from continuing operations of million generated during the year ended december  we conduct  evaluate and report on our upstream business as one segment 
on may   we completed our acquisition of cc energy ii llc crow creek energy  as discussed below 
our upstream segment includes operated and non operated wells located in the mid continent which includes areas in oklahoma  arkansas  the texas panhandle and north texas  permian which includes areas in west texas  east south texas mississippi  and southern alabama which also includes two treating facilities  and one natural gas processing plant and related gathering systems 
during the year ended december   our upstream business generated operating income of million compared to operating income of million generated during the year ended december  the final segment that we report on is our corporate and other segment  which is where we account for our risk management activity excluding any risk management activity associated with our natural gas marketing and trading activities  intersegment eliminations and our general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   our corporate segment generated an operating loss  excluding intersegment eliminations  of million compared to an operating loss of million generated during the year ended december  results reflected net gains  realized and unrealized  on our commodity derivatives of million during the year ended december  compared to a net loss  realized and unrealized  on our commodity derivatives of million during the year ended december  see summary of consolidated operating results corporate and other segment for a further discussion of the impact of our commodity derivatives 
acquisition on may   we completed the acquisition the crow creek acquisition of all of the outstanding membership interests of crow creek energy  a portfolio company of natural gas partners  viii  lp ngp viii  for total consideration of million consisting of million common units valued at million at the closing of the acquisition  debt assumed of million and cash of approximately million 
the cash portion of the acquisition consideration and the repayment of crow creek energy s outstanding debt was funded through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in 
table of contents addition  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses  which are included within general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  the oil and natural gas properties acquired from crow creek energy are located in multiple basins across oklahoma  north texas and arkansas the mid continent properties and provide us with an extensive inventory of low risk development prospects 
impairment we incurred impairment charges during the year ended december  of million 
of this amount  million related to the write down of our idle turkey creek plant in our texas panhandle segment 
we determined that the assets that made up our turkey creek plant could not be used elsewhere within our business  and thus we decided to remove all above ground equipment and structures 
we also incurred impairment charges during the year ended december  of million in our upstream business related to certain legacy proved undeveloped and unproved properties which we no longer intend to develop based on the current commodity price environment and the performance of offsetting wells 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment charges within our upstream segment related to certain wells in our unproved properties as we determined it would not be economical to develop these unproved locations and million in impairment charges within our east texas and other midstream segment due to the loss of a significant gathering contract 
pursuant to gaap  our impairment analysis does not take into account the value of our commodity derivative instruments  which generally increase as the estimates of future prices decline 
further declines in commodity prices and other factors could result in additional impairment charges and changes to the fair value of our derivative instruments 
other matters potential impact of new environmental standards we have certain obligations under our air emissions permit to lower the so emissions of our alabama plant operations 
additionally  in mid  the environmental protection agency epa enacted new national ambient air quality standards naaqs which substantially lowered the emissions limits for so and mandated timelines for compliance 
in order to fulfill its permit obligations  comply with the new naaqs requirements  and replace and upgrade certain assets in our alabama facilities  we expect to spend approximately million over the next several years at the locations of our alabama operations 
the expected facility upgrades to our alabama operations should not only increase the marketable sulfur recovered from the inlet gas stream  but also are anticipated to reduce plant fuel consumption  improve the plant s operating reliability and extend the plant s operating life 
management does not anticipate  however  that the required spending will generate returns consistent with our internal rate of return thresholds for discretionary capital investment 
at this time  management has identified no other operational areas impacted by the naaqs 
management expects that a substantial percentage of the total capital invested to achieve the so emissions standard at our alabama operations will be classified as maintenance capital  and therefore will reduce the amount of distributable cash flow we recognize in the periods in which the capital is spent 
upstream borrowing base redetermination on october   we announced that the upstream segment component of the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at million by our commercial lenders as part of our regularly scheduled semi annual borrowing base redetermination 
this represented an increase of million from the previous level of million 
the redetermined borrowing base was effective october  the midstream component of our borrowing base is redetermined quarterly based on our midstream ebitda as defined in the revolving credit facility for the trailing twelve months 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measures to analyze our performance 
we view these measures as important indicators of our profitability and review these measures on a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis 
these measures include volumes  margin  operating expenses and adjusted ebitda defined on page 
on a company wide basis 
volumes by business midstream volumes 
in our midstream business  due to the natural production decline of the wells connected to our systems we must continually obtain new supplies of natural gas to maintain or increase throughput volumes on our gathering 
table of contents and processing systems 
our ability to maintain existing supplies of natural gas and obtain new supplies is impacted by successful drilling activity and the level of workovers or recompletions of existing connected wells in areas currently dedicated to our pipelines  our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in other areas and our ability to obtain natural gas that has been released from other commitments 
we routinely monitor producer activity in the areas served by our gathering and processing systems to pursue new supply opportunities 
we rely on producer drilling activity to maintain and grow our midstream volumes 
generally  producer drilling activity is correlated to the current and expected price of natural gas  and to ngls in producing basins that have liquids rich gas reservoirs 
as such  throughput volume in our existing midstream assets will typically increase in times of rising natural gas and ngl prices and will typically decrease in times of falling natural gas and ngl prices 
in producing basins that have liquids rich gas reservoirs  the rise and fall of throughput volumes tends to correlate more predominately with the rise and fall of ngl prices  in particular when natural gas prices approach or achieve historical lows 
upstream volumes 
in the upstream segment  we continually monitor the production rates of the wells we operate 
this information is a critical indicator of the performance of our wells  and we evaluate and respond to any significant adverse changes 
we employ an experienced team of engineering and operations professionals to monitor these rates on a well by well basis and to design and implement remediation activities when necessary 
we also design and implement workover and drilling operations to increase production in order to offset the natural decline of our currently producing wells 
because our rates of return on new workover and drilling activity are determined in part on commodity prices  we may elect to scale back or cancel such activity during periods of low commodity prices 
furthermore  we may elect to shut in existing production in extreme commodity downturns ie  when the realized prices we receive are below our operating costs on a per unit basis 
margin commodity pricing 
the margins in our midstream business generally are positively correlated to ngl and condensate prices  and may be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decline in relation to the price of natural gas 
we refer to the price of ngls in relation to the price of natural gas as the fractionation spread 
in our upstream segment  our margins generally will correlate with changes in crude oil  natural gas  ngl and sulfur prices 
risk management 
we conduct risk management activities to mitigate the effect of commodity price and interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows 
our primary method of risk management in this respect is entering into derivative contracts 
the impact of our risk management activities are captured in our corporate segment 
for a further discussion of our risk management activities  see part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk operating expenses midstream operating expenses 
we monitor midstream operating expenses as a measure of the operating efficiency of our field operations 
direct labor  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses are largely independent of the volumes through our systems  but fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
upstream operating expenses 
we monitor and evaluate our upstream segment operating costs routinely  both on a total cost and unit cost basis 
many of the operating costs we incur are not directly related to the quantity of hydrocarbons that we produce  so we strive to maximize our production rates in order to improve our unit operating costs 
the most significant portion of our upstream segment operating costs is associated with the operation of the big escambia creek treating and processing facilities 
these facilities are overseen by members of our midstream engineering and operations staff 
the majority of the cost of operating these facilities is independent of their throughput 
this includes items such as labor  chemicals  utilities and materials 
adjusted ebitda see discussion of adjusted ebitda in part ii  item selected financial data 

table of contents general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends 
this expectation is based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us  however  our actual results may vary materially from our expectations 
natural gas supply and demand natural gas prices are more dependent than crude oil prices on regional supply and demand due to the relative difficulty in transporting natural gas from producing to consuming regions of the world 
in the united states  where we produce natural gas  the outlook for natural gas demand has improved since the depths of the recession  but we do not expect significant increases in the demand for natural gas during over the longer term  however  we believe that the environmental advantages that natural gas has over coal  and its current low price  will result in the construction of additional natural gas fired electricity generation capacity  both for new capacity and to replace aging coal fired facilities 
during and  natural gas prices continued to fall and remained relatively low compared to the prices experienced prior to the recession 
our expectation was that these lower prices would lead to reduced gas well drilling and lower natural gas production  and  combined with the resumption of growth in the united states economy  would provide support to natural gas prices 
this did not occur in  however 
operators continued to drill gas wells in emerging shale gas plays such as the haynesville and marcellus plays although at lower rates of drilling than in previous years 
in addition  producers continued to increase their drilling in liquids rich gas plays such as the granite wash and the eagle ford in order to extract the more valuable ngls from the raw gas stream 
these continued drilling activities have resulted in a significant oversupply of natural gas that has reduced prices to their lowest levels in years 
because of the high prices received for the oil  condensate and natural gas liquids  we expect that drilling in these liquids rich plays will remain robust and they will continue to provide a source of future natural gas supply for the next several years  resulting in depressed natural gas prices at least through crude oil supply  demand and outlook the majority of the world s crude oil production and reserves is controlled by foreign governments and state owned oil companies 
many of these countries rely on crude oil exports to fund their governmental expenditures  and in some of these the export of crude oil represents the bulk of their economic output 
certain exporting countries have seen declines in their production rates due to low levels of capital re investment in their oil industry 
we believe that  while some oil exporting countries will be able to increase their production to meet future increases in demand  that others will have a difficult time maintaining their production levels and that this may result in an undersupplied market for crude oil within a few years 
there are several factors which influence the demand for crude oil  but ultimately the continued growth of the developing economies will result in much greater demand for crude oil 
it is uncertain how quickly demand will exceed supply  but we believe that crude oil prices may remain high relative to historical averages or further strengthen over the next one to two years 
historically  natural gas liquids prices have tended to have a high correlation to crude oil prices  especially for propane and heavier ngls  but we believe this correlation may weaken in late and through the high levels of liquids directed drilling in the united states has resulted in significant increases in the supply of ngl s and there are capacity constraints at various points in the ngl manufacturing infrastructure 
since the butane and heavier components of the ngl stream are more readily substituted for crude oil  we expect the correlation between the prices of those components and crude oil to remain fairly high  but we expect price weakness relative to crude oil in propane 
the majority of the ngls we produce are delivered into the conway  kansas hub 
we also expect that basis differentials between the primary us ngl hub at mont belvieu and other pricing points such as conway will remain at their current high levels due to transportation and fractionation constraints until mid to late ethane prices historically have been less correlated to crude oil than have the heavier ngls 
ethane demand is primarily driven by global petrochemical production and specifically by its use as a feedstock for ethylene production 
ethane s low price relative to heavier ethylene feedstocks has resulted in strong worldwide demand  and chemical manufacturers have recently announced projects to increase their ethylene production capacity using ethane 
we believe this trend will provide support to ethane prices throughout  however  the increase in liquids directed drilling activity has and is expected to continue to substantially increase the supply of ethane  which could result in downward pressure on ethane prices over the medium term 
as with the other ngls  we expect that basis differentials between mont belvieu and other pricing points will remain elevated by historical standards through  at which time additional ngl infrastructure is expected to become operational  leading to a reduction of the basis differentials between mont belvieu and other pricing points around the country 

table of contents sulfur supply  demand and outlook much of the natural gas that we produce in the east texas and alabama regions within our upstream segment contains high  naturally occurring concentrations of hydrogen sulfide 
this is a corrosive  poisonous gas that must be removed from the natural gas stream before it can be processed for ngl extraction or sale 
the process of removing the hydrogen sulfide yields a large amount of elemental sulfur  which we sell or otherwise dispose of 
the process of removing hydrogen sulfide from natural gas  and similar processes for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from sour crude oils prior to refining  is the primary source of sulfur production in the united states and the world 
the primary use of sulfur is the production of sulfuric acid  and one of the major uses of sulfuric acid is the production of phosphoric acid 
phosphoric acid is a key raw material in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers 
therefore  one of the major factors influencing the demand for sulfur is the demand for fertilizer 
the region around tampa  florida contains a large amount of fertilizer manufacturing facilities  and tampa also serves as an export port for sulfur 
for many years  the supply of sulfur was greater than the available demand  such that tampa prices fluctuated within a narrow band of to per long ton 
depending on a seller s proximity to tampa  transportation charges may have equaled or exceeded the selling price of the sulfur under this pricing environment 
beginning in the second half of  global demand for fertilizer increased significantly  and as a result  tampa prices also rose to record levels 
in late  sulfur prices at tampa peaked at over per long ton 
the global economic recession greatly reduced fertilizer demand  however  much of this demand has returned 
as with many commodities  the developing economies are responsible for much of this demand growth 
by the end of  tampa sulfur prices had fallen to zero dollars per long ton  and they remained low throughout by the end of  prices had risen to per long ton 
we expect demand to remain relatively strong in  but not as great as that in nevertheless  over the next few years  continued rapid growth in emerging economies could result in supply demand imbalances that could lead to the types of price spikes we experienced in impact of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions the operations of and use of the products produced by the natural gas and oil industry are sources of emissions of certain greenhouse gases ghg  namely carbon dioxide and methane 
regulation of ghg emissions has not had an impact on our operations in the past  and the regulation of our ghg emissions as such has not occurred 
however  there is a trend towards government imposed limitation of ghg emissions at the state  regional  and federal level 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  by virtue of a supreme court decision  was deemed to have authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other ghg emissions under the clean air act  and they are drafting and preparing to implement regulations 
it is possible that legislation will be proposed to amend the clean air act to exclude ghg  although the probability of the enactment of such legislation is uncertain 
in addition  in there was a significant effort in the united states congress to enact legislation to establish a cap and trade system as a means to regulate ghg emissions 
a cap and trade bill was approved by the house of representatives  but was not approved in the senate 
given the house of representatives is now under control of the republican party which has historically opposed to ghg regulation  the probability of enactment of a cap and trade bill during the next two years is low 
because of the uncertainty of the nature of any potential future federal ghg regulations at this time  we are unable to forecast how future regulation of ghg emissions would negatively impact our operations 
we will continue to monitor regulatory developments and to assess our ability to reasonably predict the economic impact of these developments on our business 
the commercial risk associated with the exploration and production of fossil fuels lies in the uncertainty of regulations that may affect our customers  which could affect the demand for crude oil and natural gas 
such an impact on demand could have an adverse impact on the demand for our services  and could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on the other hand  when burned  natural gas produces less greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels  such as refined petroleum products or coal 
as a result  climate change legislation or ghg emissions regulations could create an increased demand for natural gas 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
table of contents conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
on an ongoing basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments based on management s best available knowledge of previous  current  and expected future events 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and estimates are subject to change due to modifications in the underlying conditions or assumptions 
currently  we do not foresee any reasonably likely changes to our current estimates and assumptions which would materially affect amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
below are expanded discussions of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments  ie  those that reflect more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii
