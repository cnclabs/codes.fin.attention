item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
refer to item contained herein for additional information regarding our business objectives  investment strategies  and operating segments 
property portfolio as of december   our property portfolio contained properties with approximately  beds in approximately  apartment units 
our property portfolio consisted of owned off campus student housing properties that are in close proximity to colleges and universities  ace properties operated under ground facility leases with five university systems  four on campus participating properties operated under ground facility leases with the related university systems  and one property containing a retail shopping center which we plan to develop into a mixed use community including both student housing and retail 
of the properties  were under development as of december   and when completed will consist of a total of approximately  beds in approximately  units 
our communities contain modern housing units and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming  with many offering resort style amenities 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
third party development and management services we provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
as of december   we were under contract on four third party development projects that are currently in progress and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of august as of december   we also provided third party management and leasing services for properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units  and one joint venture property in which we own a noncontrolling interest with approximately beds in approximately units 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our wholly owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services development revenues are generally recognized based on a proportional performance method based on contract deliverables  while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
for projects where our fee is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net fee generated on those projects 
incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
we also evaluate the collectability of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances  including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects  and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred  until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
because we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained  we bear the risk of loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
as such  management evaluates the status of third party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues 
such write offs are included in third party development and management services expenses in the case of third party development projects or general and administrative expenses in the case of owned development projects on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
impairment of long lived assets on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
for our properties under development  capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our total debt 
upon substantial completion of the properties  cost capitalization ceases 
the total capitalized development costs are then transferred to the applicable asset category and depreciation commences 
these estimates used by management require judgment  and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods

new property operations 
our new properties consist of the following i property fidelity portfolio  ii nd avenue centre  acquired in december  iii sanctuary lofts  acquired in july  iv campus trails  a property that experienced significant property damage in april as a result of a fire in which beds were destroyed and reopened for occupancy in august  v four owned development projects that opened for occupancy in august  vi university shoppes orlando  acquired in july  vii eagles trail  acquired in september  viii studio green  acquired in november  and ix west and the varsity  both acquired in december these new properties contributed an additional million of revenues and an additional million of operating expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  same store property operations excluding new property activity 
excluding five properties included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  we had properties containing  beds which were operating during both years ended december  and these properties produced revenues of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates for the and academic years as well as an increase in average occupancy from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing same store properties  operating expenses increased approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased utility  maintenance and payroll costs incurred during the year ended december  as compared with as a result of higher occupancy at the properties 
these increases were offset by a decrease to property tax expense for the year december  due to the successful resolution of property tax appeals for certain of our same store properties for tax years ranging from we anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations we had four participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both years ended december  and revenues from our participating properties increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily a result of an increase in average rental rates during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  as well as an increase in average occupancy from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  at these properties  operating expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a utility refund of approximately million received at one of the properties in  offset by general inflationary increases 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of general inflation 
third party development services revenue third party development services revenue decreased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to million of revenue earned during the year ended december  from our university of california irvine phase iii project  which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august million of the revenue earned in related to our participation in cost savings on the project 
in addition  lower fees were recognized during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year for our edinboro phase ii project  which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august these decreases were offset by the closing of bond financing and commencement of construction on our illinois state university  northern illinois university and university of wyoming projects during the year ended december   which in total contributed an additional million to third party development services revenue during the period 
during the year ended december   we had six projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately million  as compared to the year ended december  in which we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately million 
development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project 
in addition  to the extent projects are completed under budget  we may be entitled to a portion of such savings  which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
it is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
third party management services revenue third party management services revenue decreased by approximately million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we experienced a decrease in management services revenue of approximately million during year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of the fidelity portfolio 
we anticipate third party management services revenue to decrease slightly in primarily as a result of the discontinuation of three management contracts in early that contributed approximately million of management services revenue during the year ended december  third party development and management services expenses third party development and management services expenses decreased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of less activity in our management services segment due to our acquisition of the fidelity portfolio 
we anticipate third party development and management services expenses to increase slightly in as a result of an increase in our pursuit of ace projects and general inflation 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of additional salary and benefits expense  public company costs and other general inflationary factors during the year ended december   offset by million of acquisition related costs such as broker fees  due diligence costs and legal and accounting fees incurred during the year ended december   related to the purchase of the fidelity portfolio 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase in as a result of increased salary and benefits expense  including restricted stock award amortization  increased public company expenses  anticipated increases in travel related expenditures and general inflationary increases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the following items i additional depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  related to our acquisition of the property fidelity portfolio  ii additional depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  related to the acquisition of eight other properties during and  and iii the completion of construction and opening of four owned developments in august  which contributed an additional million of depreciation expense 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase significantly in as a result of properties acquired during  the completion of four owned development projects in august and the anticipated completion of owned development projects  currently under construction  scheduled to open for occupancy in fall ground facility leases ground facility leases expense increased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a utility refund of approximately million received in at one of our on campus participating properties  which increased the university s share of the cash flow available for distribution 
we anticipate ground facility leases expense to increase in as a result of the completion of construction and commencement of operations of two ace development projects in august and the anticipated completion of six ace development projects  currently under construction  scheduled to open for occupancy in fall interest income interest income increased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in  we entered into two option agreements to purchase two properties that will open in august as part of the option agreements  we provided mezzanine financing to the developers  for which we earn interest at a rate of per annum 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we experienced a decrease in interest expense of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year as a result of mortgage and construction loans paid off during and in addition  interest expense decreased as a result of an increase in capitalized interest of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the respective periods 
these decreases were offset by additional interest of approximately million incurred during the year ended december  related to loans assumed in connection with our acquisition of the property fidelity portfolio 
we also incurred million of additional interest expense on our corporate level debt related to our new million unsecured term loan which was used to repay our maturing million senior secured term loan in may and increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility to partially fund property acquisitions in we expect interest expense to increase in as a result of the timing of increased borrowings under our unsecured term loan and an anticipated unsecured bond offering in  which will be slightly offset by reduced interest expense due to the payoff of mortgage debt in and mortgage debt scheduled to mature in  and an increase in capitalized interest associated with our increased owned development activity 
amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an additional million of finance cost amortization recorded during the year ended december  in connection with finance costs paid upon the assumption of debt from our acquisition of the property fidelity portfolio 
in addition  million of finance cost amortization was recorded during the year ended december  associated with finance costs incurred in connection with our new million credit facility entered into in may these increases were offset by a decrease in finance cost amortization of million as a result of mortgage debt paid off during and we expect amortization of deferred financing costs in to decrease as a result of mortgage debt paid off in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures loss from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the following items i a million decrease in our share of the loss from the joint ventures with fidelity as a result of our purchase of the full ownership interests in the fidelity portfolio in september and november  and ii a million decrease in our share of the loss from the hampton roads military housing joint venture as a result of us discontinuing the application of the equity method for our investment in this joint venture 
other nonoperating income other nonoperating income of million for the year ended december  represents the following items i a million gain recorded to remeasure our equity method investments in two joint ventures with fidelity  in which we held a interest  to fair value immediately prior to our acquisitions in september and november of the remaining interest in properties owned by the joint ventures  and ii a gain on insurance settlement of million related to a fire that occurred at one of our owned off campus properties in april the gain represents insurance proceeds received in excess of the book value of the property written off as a result of the fire damage

interest expense interest expense increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred an additional million of interest related to loans assumed in connection with our acquisition of the property fidelity portfolio 
we also incurred an additional million in interest expense during the year ended december  related to our freddie mac revolving credit facility entered into in september  as well as an additional million of interest expense in related to the timing of draws and paydowns on our million revolving credit facility 
in addition  interest expense increased as a result of a decrease in capitalized interest of million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the respective periods

refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein for a table summarizing the results of operations of the properties classified within discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances and cash flows as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states 
the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in item herein 
operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to operating cash flows provided from the timing of the acquisition of properties in and five properties in  the completion of construction and opening of four owned development projects in august  and improved operations at our same store wholly owned properties 
investing activities investing activities utilized approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in cash utilized in investing activities was primarily a result of the following i a million increase in cash used to fund the construction of our wholly owned development properties as wholly owned properties were under construction during the year ended december   of which four were completed and opened for occupancy in august  while four wholly owned properties were under construction during the year ended december   ii an million increase in cash paid to acquire properties as we acquired five unencumbered properties in as compared to properties in  of which of the properties were encumbered with million of property level mortgage debt  iii entered into two option agreements to purchase two properties scheduled to open in august and as part of these agreements  we provided mezzanine financing to the respective developers totaling million  iv paid cash of million during the year ended december  to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest from third party partners in joint ventures that own and operate two wholly owned properties  and v acquired a interest in a partnership that owns a property  including loaning million to the seller to retain a noncontrolling interest in the property 
these increases in cash utilized in investing activities were primarily offset by a million increase in net proceeds received from property dispositions 
four unencumbered wholly owned properties were sold during the year ended december  as compared to two encumbered wholly owned properties during the year ended december  financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the following i a million increase in proceeds net of paydowns received from our corporate credit facilities during the year ended december   which was used toward the acquisition of properties and the pay off of maturing mortgage and construction debt  ii a million increase in proceeds from construction loans used to partially fund the construction of three wholly owned development properties  scheduled to open for occupancy in august  and iii a million increase in the change of our construction accounts payable balance as a result of an increase in development activity financed with construction loans in as compared to these increases were offset by i a million decrease in net proceeds raised through the issuance of our common stock  ii a million increase in cash used to pay off maturing mortgage and construction debt  iii a million increase in distributions to stockholders during the year ended december   as a result of the issuance of common stock in connection with our august equity offering and our atm equity programs  and iv a million increase in debt issuance and assumption costs as a result of million paid to close on a combined million credit facility in may  offset by million in debt assumption costs during the year ended december  associated with mortgage debt assumed in connection with property acquisitions 
liquidity needs  sources and uses of capital as of december   our short term liquidity needs included  but were not limited to  the following i anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of per share based on the number of our shares outstanding as of december   ii anticipated distribution payments to our operating partnership unitholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual distribution of per common unit of limited partnership interest common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of on our preferred units of limited partnership interest series a preferred units based on the number of units outstanding as of december   iii the pay off of approximately million of fixed rate mortgage debt scheduled to mature during the next months  iv estimated development costs over the next months totaling approximately million for wholly owned properties currently under construction  v funds for other development projects scheduled to commence construction during the next months  and vi potential future property acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements by i borrowing under our existing credit facilities and construction loans discussed below  ii potentially disposing of properties depending on market conditions  iii issuing securities  including common stock  under our million at the market atm share offering program  and iv utilizing net cash provided by operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company was assigned a baa issuer rating by moody s investors service and a bbb corporate credit rating by standard poor s ratings services 
both ratings are considered investment grade and indicated a stable outlook for the company 
these ratings potentially provide us with access to the unsecured bond market  an additional avenue that can be used to fund our liquidity needs 
we may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities and term loan 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
atm equity programs as discussed in more detail in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  during and  we utilized our atm share offering programs to sell shares of our common stock into the existing trading market at current market prices 
as of december   we had approximately million available for issuance under our atm equity program 
unsecured credit facility as discussed in more detail in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  in may  we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility 
pursuant to the new credit facility  which includes an unsecured revolving credit facility and an unsecured term loan  the size of the combined facility was increased to million and certain maturity dates were extended 
we also have interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate to spread on million of the million outstanding balance of the new unsecured term loan 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december   the balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average annual rate of  and availability under the revolving credit facility totaled approximately million 
the terms of the combined credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants  as discussed more fully in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  including covenants that restrict the amount of distributions that we can pay 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
secured agency facility as discussed in more detail in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  we also have a million secured revolving credit facility with a freddie mac lender 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the facility totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average annual rate of 
the secured agency facility includes some  but not all  of the same financial covenants as the credit facility  as described above 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may use borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility to fund distributions 
the board of directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels  including market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements 
on january   we declared a fourth quarter distribution per share of  which was paid on february  to all common stockholders of record as of february  at the same time  the operating partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of common units  as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of series a preferred units 
recurring capital expenditures recurring capital expenditures represent expenditures that are recurring in nature to maintain a property s income  value  and competitive position within the market 
recurring capital expenditures typically include  but are not limited to  appliances  furnishings  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  and kitchen bath cabinets 
maintenance and repair costs incurred during our annual turn process due to normal wear and tear by residents are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures exclude expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property and are considered necessary to bring the property up to our operating standards  as well as capital expenditures for renovations  community repositioning  and other revenue enhancing projects 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties  which may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred by us during those periods 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our wholly owned properties are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds total recurring capital expenditures average per bed pre development expenditures our third party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
the closing and or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  and other required governmental permits and authorizations as such  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
historically  our third party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed  however  these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million in pre development costs related to third party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately  million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding net unamortized debt discounts and debt premiums of approximately million and million  respectively  comprised of a million balance on our unsecured term loan  million balance on our secured agency facility  million balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility  million in mortgage and construction loans secured by our wholly owned properties  million in mortgage loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was per annum 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt  comprised of our secured agency facility  unsecured revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and three construction loans discussed below 
wholly owned properties mortgage debt the weighted average interest rate of the million of wholly owned mortgage debt was per annum as of december  each of the mortgage loans is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
each of these mortgages has a year amortization  and none are cross defaulted or cross collateralized to any other indebtedness 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
construction loans the development and construction of two on campus ace properties the suites and hilltop townhomes  which are scheduled to complete construction and open for occupancy in august  are partially financed on a combined basis with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of may  the term of loan can be extended through may through the exercise of two month extension options 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate per annum of 
in addition  the development and construction of university pointe at college station  an on campus ace property scheduled to complete construction and open for occupancy in september  is partially financed with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of december  the term of loan can be extended through december through the exercise of two month extension options 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate per annum of 
in addition  as discussed in more detail in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item  we are consolidating a variable interest entity vie that owns the university edge property located in kent  ohio 
as a result  our construction loan payable balance includes million related to the construction loan that is financing the development and construction of this property  which is anticipated to be complete in august the total amount of the construction loan is million  bearing interest at as of december  the loan matures on january  as the company is not legally a party to this loan  and is only including the loan in its consolidated financial statements to comply with accounting guidance related to vie s  the creditor of this construction loan does not have recourse to the assets of the company 
on campus participating properties bonds as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  three of our on campus participating properties are financed with project based taxable bonds 
as of december   the bonds carry a balance of million and bear interest at a weighted average rate of 
the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
mortgage loans the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii on campus participating properties are currently encumbered by mortgage loans with balances as of december  of approximately million and million  respectively 
the loans mature in february and bear interest at a rate of libor plus 
in connection with these loans  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective february  through february   that is designated to hedge our exposure to fluctuations on interest payments attributed to changes in interest rates associated with payments on the loans 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of per annum and receive a floating rate of libor plus 
we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
off balance sheet items as discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  we continue to hold a equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture with mortgage debt outstanding of approximately million as of december  our operating partnership serves as non recourse  carve out guarantor of this debt  which means we are liable to the lender for any loss  damage  cost  expense  liability  claim or other obligation incurred by the lender arising out of or in connection with certain non recourse exceptions in connection with the debt 
pursuant to the limited liability company agreement  the joint venture agreed to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the operating partnership with respect to such obligations  except to the extent such obligations were caused by the willful misconduct  gross negligence  fraud or bad faith of the operating partnership or its employees  agents or affiliates 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt owned development projects operating leases pre sale contract capital leases long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
assumes we do not exercise extension options available to us on our unsecured credit facility  which is more fully discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  and our construction loans  which are discussed in liquidity and capital resources contained in item herein 
consists of the completion costs related to owned development projects which will be funded entirely by us and are scheduled to be completed between august and september we have entered into a contract with a general contractor for certain phases of the construction of these projects 
however  these contracts do not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place these properties into service  including the cost of furniture and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under the construction contracts 
includes minimum annual lease payments under ground facility lease agreements entered into with university systems and other third parties 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein for a more detailed discussion of our ground facility leases 
in july  we entered into a purchase and contribution agreement with a private developer whereby we are obligated to purchase a student housing property as long as the developer meets certain construction completion deadlines 
the development of the property is anticipated to be completed in august the contractual obligation amount represents the purchase price of million  less the mezzanine loan amount of million that we previously funded to the developer in july funds from operations ffo the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income or loss attributable to common shares computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from depreciable operating property sales  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
we therefore believe that ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  and interest costs  among other items  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
we also believe it is meaningful to present a measure we refer to as ffo modified  or ffom  which reflects certain adjustments related to the economic performance of our on campus participating properties 
under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
therefore  unlike the ownership of our wholly owned properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  we believe it is meaningful to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on our performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating performance of the properties 
this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is unique to us and is different from that of our owned off campus properties 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using ffom only supplementally 
further  ffo and ffom do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and ffom should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor are these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our net income loss attributable to common shareholders to ffo and ffom year ended december  net income loss attributable to common shareholders noncontrolling interests gain loss from disposition of real estate loss from unconsolidated joint ventures ffo from unconsolidated joint ventures real estate related depreciation and amortization elimination of provision for asset impairment wholly owned properties elimination of provision for asset impairment unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations ffo elimination of operations of on campus participating properties and unconsolidated joint venture net income from on campus participating properties amortization of investment in on campus participating properties ffo from hampton roads unconsolidated joint venture modifications to reflect operational performance of on campus participating properties our share of net cash flow management fees impact of on campus participating properties gain on remeasurement of equity method investments gain on insurance settlement funds from operations modified ffom ffo per share diluted ffom per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted represents our share of the ffo from three joint ventures in which we are or were a noncontrolling partner 
includes the hampton roads military housing joint venture in which we have a minimal economic interest as well as our noncontrolling interest in the fidelity joint ventures 
in september and november  we purchased fidelity s interest in joint venture properties 
subsequent to the acquisition  the properties are now wholly owned and are consolidated by us 
one property was not acquired and will continue to be owned by one of the fidelity joint ventures 
in october  nareit issued guidance directing member companies to exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate from the calculation of ffo 
previously  we had included such charges in the calculation of ffo 
in order to conform to the current nareit guidance  we have revised our calculation of ffo for all periods presented to exclude such impairment charges 
this change in presentation has no effect on ffom for any of the periods presented  as we previously excluded such charges from ffom 
for the year ended december   represents an impairment charge recorded for pirates cove  a wholly owned property classified as held for sale as of december  and is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
for the year ended december   represents an impairment charge recorded for campus walk oxford  a wholly owned property that was sold in april represents our share of impairment charges recorded during the periods presented for properties owned through our unconsolidated fidelity joint ventures 
our share of the ffo from the hampton roads military housing unconsolidated joint venture is excluded from the calculation of ffom  as management believes this amount does not accurately reflect the company s participation in the economics of the transaction 
of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for the year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
represents non cash gains recorded to remeasure our equity method investments in the fidelity joint ventures to fair value as a result of our purchase of fidelity s remaining interest in the joint venture properties in september and november represents a gain on insurance settlement related to significant property damage resulting from a fire that occurred at one of our wholly owned properties in april inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  amount in s weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total amount in s weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt includes million of the million outstanding balance on our unsecured term loan and million of mortgage loans which are effectively fixed by the use of an interest rate swap 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point variance in interest rates basis points would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flow impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt  excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements  would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
as of december   the effect of our hedge agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately million of our variable rate debt 
had the hedge agreements not been in place during  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million lower  based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated hedge agreements 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher through and the hedge agreements not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million higher 
derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements 
we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major  creditworthy financial institutions 
as part of our on going control procedures  we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity  thus minimizing credit risk concentration 
we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non performance is remote
