item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and accompanying notes set forth elsewhere in this report 
all financial information is presented in us dollars 
some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
please see information concerning forward looking statements on page overview our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the internet 
we accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers experience as they acquire  deliver or use internet services such as domain name registration  email and other internet services 
our primary distribution channel is a global network of more than  resellers in more than countries who typically provide their customers  the end users of the internet  with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence 
our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing superior services  easy to use interfaces  proactive and attentive customer service  reseller oriented technology and agile design and development processes 
we seek to provide superior customer service to our resellers by anticipating their business needs and technical requirements 
this includes providing easy to use interfaces that enable resellers to quickly and easily integrate our services into their individual business processes  and offering brandable end user interfaces that emphasize simplicity and visual appeal 
we also provide second tier support to our resellers by email and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services 
in addition  our network operating center provides proactive support to our resellers by monitoring all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted 
we believe that the underlying platforms for our services are one of the most mature  reliable and functional reseller oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry  and we continue to refine  evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end users 
our principal place of business is located in canada 
we report our financial results as one operating segment 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis  principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance 
to assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies  our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business 
accordingly  we report revenue in the following service areas opensrs  our wholesale service  manages over ten million domain names  under its icann accreditation and names tucows manages for other registrars under their own accreditations  millions of mailboxes  tens of thousands of digital certificates and our billing service  platypus through a network of over  web hosts  internet service providers  or isps  and other resellers around the world 
hover  our retail service  offers services similar to those of opensrs to consumers and small businesses 
yummynames  our domain portfolio service  manages tens of thousands of domain names  many of which generate advertising revenue and most of which we offer for resale via our reseller network and other channels 
included in the yummynames domain portfolio are over  surname domains that allow over two thirds of americans to purchase an email address based on their last name 
butterscotch  our content service  operates two advertising supported websites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com  which provide content to help consumers overcome the complexity of modern technology and the internet  in the form of over  videos and over  software and mobile listings and articles 
our business model is characterized by non refundable  up front payments  which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow 
for the years ended december   and  we reported revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our opensrs domain service offering accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively 
key business metrics we regularly review a number of business metrics  including the following key metrics to  assist us in evaluating our business  measure the performance of our business model  identify trends impacting our business  determine resource allocations  formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions 
the following table sets forth  the key business metrics which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance for the periods presented year ended december  in s total new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations provisioned domain names under management provisioned on behalf of tucows provisioned on behalf of accredited registrars total domain names under management for a discussion of these period to period changes in the domains provisioned and domains under management and how they impacted our financial results see the net revenue discussion below 
opportunities  challenges and risks the increased competition in the market for internet services in recent years  which the company expects will continue to intensify in the short and long term  poses a material risk for the company 
as new registrars are introduced  existing competitors expand service offerings and competitors offer price discounts to gain market share  the company faces pricing pressure  which can adversely impact its revenues and profitability 
to address these risks  the company has focused on leveraging the scalability of its infrastructure and its ability to provide proactive and attentive customer service to aggressively compete to attract new customers and to maintain existing customers 
our direct costs to register domain names on behalf of our customers are almost exclusively controlled by registries such as verisign and by icann 
verisign provides all the registry services operations for the 
com  
net  
cc  
tv  and 
name domain names 
icann is a private sector  not for profit corporation formed to oversee a number of internet related tasks  including domain registrations for which it collects fees 
the market for wholesale registrar services is both price sensitive and competitive  particularly for large volume customers  such as large web hosting companies and owners of large portfolios of domain names 
we have a relatively limited ability to increase the pricing of domain name registrations without negatively impacting our ability to maintain or grow our customer base 
in  we entered into contractual agreements with verisign for the supply of domain names 
these agreements were automatically renewed in february until february under the agreements  verisign charges a fee for 
com and 
net domain names of and respectively  for each year for which a domain name is registered 
effective january   verisign increased these domain name fees to and respectively 
mandated registry price increases such as these will adversely increase our service costs as a percentage of our total revenue 
in  our contractual agreement with icann was amended to extend the terms of the agreement through june  under the agreement  icann charges a fee for each year that a domain name is registered in the tlds that fall within its purview 
in addition  icann has approved a framework for the significant expansion of the number of gtlds in we believe that such expansion  once completed  will result in an increase in the number of domains we register and related revenues in in addition  we believe that the new gtld program could also provide us with new revenue opportunities in  which include operating the back end infrastructure for new tld registries and or owning one or more tlds in our own right 
our revenue is primarily realized in us dollars and a major portion of our operating expenses are paid in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar may have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in particular  we may be adversely affected by a significant weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar on a quarterly and an annual basis 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage our financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some or all of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exchange risk on a portion of our canadian dollar exposure 
we may not always enter into such forward contracts and such contracts may not always be available and economical for us 
additionally  the forward rates established by the contracts may be less advantageous than the market rate upon settlement 
display advertising from the desk top software download site has historically been the largest source of butterscotch revenue 
this revenue stream has suffered from the secular shift away from desktop software 
recently  we have experienced an increase in video advertising and corporate video revenue as advertisers continue to migrate their advertising spend towards more content rich websites such as butterscotch 
com 
a portion of this increase was from larger video contracts which may not be repeatable 
in addition  to reach a wider audience of consumers  butterscotch has refocused its efforts towards mobile technology 
we believe that these initiatives present us with a potentially larger long term revenue opportunity 
however  if our marketing efforts with the above initiatives  together with other initiatives we take to grow our revenue and our page views  are not successful in offsetting any decline we experience in display advertising from the desk top software download site  in the short term  may result in a decline in butterscotch revenue 
net revenues opensrs we derive revenue from our reseller network by providing them with reseller services that comprise a domain service  b email service and c other services 
other services include the provisioning of secure sockets layer ssl  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions through our platypus software  and from time to time we receive fees from vendors to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
opensrs domain service historically  our opensrs domain service has constituted the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration  renewal  transfer and management of domain names 
in addition  this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a customer will engage us  enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our domain portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration 
we also provide resellers with the ability to sell personal names 
this service allows resellers the opportunity to sell email addresses based on our domain portfolio of surname domain names 
with the acquisition of epag domainservices gmbh epag in august  we now offer registration services for over tlds 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations  our pricing structure for domain names provides visibility into the various fees that make up the cost of a domain name by breaking out the cost of the registry and icann fees separately from our management fee 
effective january  registry fees for the 
com and 
net registrations were increased by the registry to and  respectively 
the management fee provides our resellers with access to our provisioning and management tools to enable them to register and administer domain names and access to additional services like whois privacy and dns services  enhanced domain name suggestion tools and access to our premium domain name services 
we earn fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years  with a majority having a one year term 
opensrs email service we derive revenue from our hosted email service through our global distribution network 
our email service is offered on a per account  per month basis  and provides resellers with a reliable  scalable white label hosted email solutions that can be customized to their branding and business model requirements 
the email service also includes spam and virus filtering on all accounts 
end users can access the email service via a full featured  multi language ajax enabled web interface  a wap mobile interface  or through traditional desktop email clients  such as microsoft outlook or apple mail  using imap or pop smtp and gb of email storage 
other opensrs services we derive revenue from other services primarily from provisioning ssl certificates 
from time to time  we also receive fees from vendors to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
in addition  we provide billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions to isps through our platypus billing software 
yummynames we derive revenue from our portfolio of domain names by displaying advertising on the domains and by making them available for sale or lease 
in addition we display advertising on parked pages within opensrs 
parked pages are domain names registered with us that do not yet contain an active website 
when a user types one of these domain names into a web browser  they are presented with dynamically generated links that are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of these links  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click advertising parked page vendors 
our parked page vendor relationships may not continue to generate levels of revenue commensurate with what we have achieved during past periods 
our ability to generate online advertising revenue from parked page vendors depends on their advertising networks assessment of the quality and performance characteristics of internet traffic resulting from online advertisements rendered on their websites 
we have no control over any of these quality assessments 
parked page vendors may from time to time change their existing  or establish new  methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality of internet traffic and delivering pay per click advertisements 
any changes in these methodologies  metrics and advertising technology platforms could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements 
in addition  parked page vendors may at any time change or suspend the nature of the service that they provide to online advertisers 
these types of changes or suspensions would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from pay per click advertising 
portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service  auctions or in negotiated sales 
the size of our domain name portfolio varies over time  as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio 
in evaluating names for sale  we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay per click advertising  as well as other factors 
the name will be offered for sale if  based on our evaluation  the name is deemed non essential to our business and management believes that deriving proceeds from the sale is strategically more beneficial to the company 
portfolio names that have been acquired from third parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we also offer the same services to our customers  allowing them to make available names registered by them for monetization on a similar basis 
for customer names  we earn a referral fee for premium names or names sold or leased  and participate on a revenue share basis for names offered through our pay per click advertising program 
hover we derive revenues from hover s sale of retail internet domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses 
these services include the sale of personalized email through tucows portfolio of surname based domain names as well as simplified interfaces that allow customers to connect their domain names to websites and email addresses through a unique domain forwarding system 
butterscotch we also generate advertising and other revenue through two ad supported content sites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com 
butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com primarily derive revenue from banner and text advertising on their sites 
in addition  their revenue is derived from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center to submit their products for inclusion on our site and to purchase promotional placements of their software 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or fiscal  includes further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives and valuation of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  fair value measurement of assets and liabilities  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from the following services opensrs domain  email and other services  yummynames  hover  and butterscotch 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a reseller may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when a standalone selling price exists for each deliverable  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on the relative selling price of each of the deliverables 
the standalone selling price is established for each deliverable by the price charged when that deliverable is sold separately by the company which is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
for arrangements where the company does not sell the deliverable separately  the selling price is determined based on third party evidence tpe  which is the price at which a competitor or third party sells the same or similar and largely interchangeable deliverable on a standalone basis 
in instances where vsoe and tpe do not exist  the company uses an estimated selling price for the deliverable  which is the price at which a company would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a standalone basis 
payments for the full term of all services are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names  through yummynames  consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company s control 
collectability of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only when payment is received  except where a fixed contract has been negotiated  in which case revenues are recognized once all the terms of the contract have been satisfied 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our websites  tucows 
com and butterscotch 
com 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of post presentation impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
custom video production revenue is recognized on acceptance of the completed video by the customer 
changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we record provisions for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by taking into account factors such as our historical collection and write off experience  the number of days the customer is past due and the status of the customer s account with respect to whether or not the customer is continuing to receive service 
the contingent liability estimates are based on management s historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of liabilities and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional provisions may be required 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in business combinations 
finite life intangible assets  related to the acquisition of epag in august  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of two to seven years  and consist of technology  brand and customer relationships 
finite life intangible assets  related to the acquisition of innerwise  inc in july  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of five to seven years  and consist of brand and customer relationships 
indefinite life intangible assets  acquired in the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june  consist of surname domain names and direct navigation domain names 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we review goodwill and indefinite life intangibles at least annually for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
with regards to property  equipment and definite life intangible assets  we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite life intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
there was no impairment recorded on definite life intangible assets and property and equipment during and our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for our reporting unit as of december   did not result in an impairment charge 
we determined the estimated fair value of our reporting unit using the income approach and the market approach to determine that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value 
this analysis was consistent with the approach we utilized in our analysis performed in prior years 
determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions 
the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of our reporting unit included a cash flow projections  which include growth and allocation assumptions for forecasted revenue and expenses  b a residual growth rate of  and c a discount rate of  which was based upon our reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the assessment 
as of the date of our annual impairment test  our estimated fair values for our reporting unit  based on reasonable changes in assumptions exceed its carrying value by a range of to 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting unit are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of our control that could cause actual results to materially differ from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of our reporting unit to fall below its carrying value  resulting in a potential impairment charge 
in addition  changes in our organizational structure or how our management allocates resources and assesses performance  could result in a change in our operating segments or reporting units  requiring a reallocation and updated impairment analysis of goodwill 
a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million in goodwill and million in intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we apply a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate based on new information that may become available 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period that such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our net revenues  by revenue source year ended december  opensrs domain services email services other services total opensrs services yummy names hover butterscotch increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  opensrs domain services email services other services total opensrs services yummy names hover butterscotch total net revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december   or fiscal deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to million from million at december  no customer accounted for more than of revenue during fiscal and  at december   one customer accounted for of accounts receivable 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis  we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
opensrs during fiscal  opensrs revenue increased by million  or to million when compared to fiscal primarily as a result of opensrs domain revenue increasing by million or to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to our success in attracting customers with increased transaction volumes  the impact of the epag acquisition and the impact of the registration fee increase implemented in july for registration fees paid to certain registries 
in addition  email revenue increased by million or to million and other services increased by million or to million as a result of market development funds vendors have provided us to expand or maintain the market position for their services 
other service increases in future periods may not be commensurate with what we have achieved during past periods as our vendor partners may elect to cancel or amend their marketing programs at any time 
during fiscal  the total new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations that we processed increased by million or to million registrations as compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing efforts to attract new clients and retain existing customers  as well as our acquisition of epag in august as of december   the total domain names under our management had increased by million  or  to million domain names  as compared to the total domain names under our management as of december  this increase is primarily the result in our success at attracting new customers with increased transaction volumes and includes the million domains that were added through the acquisition of epag 
in addition  we provide provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
the number of domain names we manage on behalf of other accredited registrars remained essentially flat at million at both december  and december  yummynames net revenues from our yummynames domain portfolio service for fiscal remained essentially flat at million compared to fiscal during fiscal  we earned million by making domain names in our portfolio available for sale or lease  compared to million during fiscal in addition we earned million from our pay per click advertising or parked pages program during fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease primarily reflects the decrease in the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages of million as a result of the impact our domain name sales have on our advertising revenue and the general economic conditions resulting in a generally slower advertising environment 
these decreases have been partially offset by our success at selling domain names from our portfolio 
the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as we have experienced from past acquisitions 
in addition  the revenue we derive from domain portfolio services is driven by general macroeconomic factors that affect internet advertising 
our advertising expenditures are typically sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of economic uncertainty 
hover net revenues from hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
we believe that this increase reflects the success of our marketing initiatives and improved website in attracting new customers and retaining existing ones 
butterscotch net revenues from butterscotch for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
these decreases reflect the decrease in revenue from certain corporate video initiatives that were undertaken during fiscal and which were not continued during fiscal as well as a decrease in revenues from the display advertising from the tucows 
com desk top software libraries which historically has been the largest source of butterscotch revenue and our author resource center 
cost of revenues opensrs opensrs domain service cost of revenues for domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the period 
market development funds that do not meet the criteria for revenue recognition under asc customer payments and incentives  are reflected as cost of goods sold and are recognized as earned 
opensrs email service cost of revenues for email services are payable to third party providers for licensing and royalty costs related to the provision of certain components of our email services 
fees payable for these components are included in the cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
other opensrs services costs of revenues for other reseller services include fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for ssl certificates and for printing services in connection with platypus 
fees payable for ssl certificates are amortized on a basis consistent with the provision of service  generally one year  while monthly printing fees are included in cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
yummynames costs of revenues for our domain portfolio service represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period  which is generally one year  the value attributed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of our domain name intangible assets 
as the total names in our portfolio continue to grow  this cost will become a more significant component of our cost of revenues 
payments for domain registrations are payable for the full term of service at the time of activation of service and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees and are expensed ratably over the renewal term 
hover costs of revenues for our provision and management of internet services on a retail basis include the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
butterscotch costs of revenues for our ad supported content sites include the fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for digital certificates sold through our content sites and content license fees 
general as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has negatively impacted operating expenses during fiscal when compared to fiscal the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has strengthened  on average  by approximately as compared to fiscal exchange rates are  however  subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
network costs network costs include personnel and related expenses  depreciation and amortization  communication costs  equipment maintenance  stock based compensation and employee and related costs directly associated with the management and maintenance of our network 
communication costs include bandwidth  co location and provisioning costs we incur to support the supply of all our services

prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees as of december  increased by million  or  to million from million at december  opensrs costs for opensrs for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased domain registration volume and the increases in july of registration fees paid to the registries 
this increase was partially offset by market development funds of million we received for fiscal yummynames costs for yummynames for fiscal as compared to fiscal remained relatively flat at million 
hover costs for hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million  and primarily reflect our success in attracting new customers and retaining existing ones 
network costs network costs before depreciation and amortization for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  primarily as a result of increased workforce costs 
network costs were also negatively impacted by the approximately strengthening  on average  in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar compared to fiscal which reflects our improved efficiency in operating and managing our co location facilities 
amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of technology from each of the boardtown corporation in april  mailbank 
com inc in june  iyd in july and epag in august the technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation is amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  and for iyd over three years  while the technology acquired in connection with each of the acquisitions of the in house software of mailbank 
com inc and epag are being amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
we expect cost of sales to increase as a result of transactional volumes and the competitive and general business environment during fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs 
these costs include commissions and related expenses of our sales  product management  public relations  call center  support and marketing personnel

income taxes the following table presents our provision for income taxes for the periods presented year ended december  provision for recovery of income taxes increase in provision over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another jurisdiction 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependent upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently believe that based on the available information  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized  and accordingly  during fiscal  we have recorded a deferred tax recovery of million related to the full release of our remaining valuation allowances 
in addition  our fiscal provision included a recovery of million related to revisions of prior year estimates and a recovery of million related to investment tax credits earned during the period 
this was offset by a provision for fiscal tax on profits of million

we will record the tax benefit of the research and development claim once we have reasonable assurance that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefit arising from the claim will be realized

opensrs during fiscal  opensrs revenue increased by million to million when compared to fiscal primarily as a result of opensrs domain revenue increasing by million or to million 
this increase resulted primarily from the impact of the increase in registration fees paid to certain registries that were implemented in july and from our success in attracting large volume customers who have higher transaction volumes 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in email revenue by million or to million  which was primarily attributable to the following two factors our decision to eliminate certain enterprise customers acquired as part of the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive in the marketplaces  and certain of our email customers  who are media portal companies and for whom email is only a small component of their overall service offerings  have chosen to include their email services as part of larger supply contracts for competitive and cost control reasons 
the last of these customers migrated away from our hosted email platform during the three months ended december  as our marketing efforts to date have not yet been successful in offsetting these customer losses  these customer losses have had a material impact on our results of operations for email services for fiscal during fiscal  the total new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations that we processed increased by million to million registrations as compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing efforts to attract new clients and retain existing customers

as of december   we managed million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  a decrease of million domain names compared to million as of december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the loss of an accredited registrar who had million domains under management with us who have transferred their domain registration business to a competitive registrar with whom they have a reciprocal supply arrangement

these decreases have been partially offset by the timing of larger portfolio sales of domain 
hover net revenues from hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from the significant development efforts that hover undertook during fiscal these development efforts resulted in a decrease in the deferred revenue balance during fiscal as cash receipts added to deferred revenue during fiscal were lower than the revenue being recognized from prior periods 
consequently  although cash receipts for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  net revenue decreased 
butterscotch net revenues from butterscotch for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily the result of increases in video advertising and corporate video revenue as advertisers continued to increase advertising spending on more content rich websites such as butterscotch 
com 
a portion of this increase was from larger video contracts which may not be repeatable 
this increase has been partially offset by the decline in our author resource center  which we believe reflects the current preference of advertisers for more content rich websites  as well as the significant decrease we have experienced in ad sense revenue  which resulted from google s elimination of their enterprise level adsense program

this increase was partially offset by certain one time email service costs we incurred during fiscal yummynames costs for yummynames for fiscal as compared to fiscal remained relatively flat at million 
hover costs for hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  to million  and resulted primarily from the introduction of new email service products  such as our family plan  which have changed our sales mix such that email services  which have a relatively lower cost of sales  account for an increased proportion of our hover costs

we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over fiscal the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during fiscal the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for fiscal of approximately million

fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the actions to hedge or mitigate these risks
