item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in thousands introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this report 
overview through our operating subsidiaries  we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented of total piano units sold but only of total piano division revenues in our boston piano line and our essex piano line are each sole sourced from asia 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could impact our business and operating results 
a breakdown of sales by our divisions and their geographic location can be found in note to the financial statements 
in  our piano sales had the following geographic breakdown based on customer location approximately in the americas  in europe  and in the asia pacific region 
for the year ended december   our piano segment sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for we anticipate improvement in both sales and gross profit in  barring any severe economic problems in major markets into which we sell 
we are currently manufacturing on a full  as opposed to reduced  production schedule  which minimizes factory inefficiencies 
we have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
however  a significant increase in demand would require additional staffing and training 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment  school budgeting  and our ability to provide competitively priced products to our dealer network 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs  the remainder is to amateur or professional musicians or performing groups  including symphonies and orchestras 
our offerings of sourced products include quality  competitively priced instruments that have our brand names and are built to our specifications 
our product offerings are tailored to the needs of traditional school music dealers who provide full service rental programs to beginning band students  as well as music retailers and e commerce dealers selling directly to end consumers from their stores or through the internet 
we believe our product offerings have helped us remain competitive at various price points and will continue to do so in the future 
in  student level instruments accounted for approximately of band orchestral unit shipments and approximately of band instrument revenues  with intermediate and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the americas  in europe  and in the asia pacific region 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for instrument orders continue to increase  so we expect sales to improve in margins should improve in the latter part of the year once factory inefficiencies are minimized at our eastlake  ohio brass instrument manufacturing plant  where a strike occurred in we currently have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand  although a significant increase in demand could require additional staffing and training 
inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of consolidated sales in we record sales in euro  japanese yen  british pounds  and chinese yuan 
in  we generated of our international sales through our piano segment 
foreign exchange rate changes increased reported sales by approximately million in the current year 
although currency fluctuations affect international sales  they also affect cost of sales and related operating expenses 
consequently  they generally have not had a material impact on operating income 
we use financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes we are subject to us income taxes as well as tax in several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
one of these foreign jurisdictions has a higher statutory rate than the united states 
in addition  certain of our operations are subject to both us and foreign taxes 
however  in such cases we receive a credit against our us taxes for foreign taxes paid equal to the percentage that such foreign income as adjusted for reallocated interest represents of the total income subject to us tax 
accordingly  our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the united states 
in  we utilized a minimal amount of foreign tax credits during the year  and carried forward million of foreign tax credits generated in the current period 
based on our analysis of anticipated foreign tax credit utilization  we recorded an additional million of valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets 
due to the low amount of taxable income  our non deductible tax items and valuation allowances related to foreign tax credits had an abnormally large impact on our effective tax rate 
as a result  we recorded an effective tax rate of  which represents an effective tax rate of relating primarily to operations and a tax benefit associated with discrete items 
in  we utilized of the foreign tax credits generated during the year  as well as million of credits previously generated 
however  due to our expectation for prospective foreign tax credit utilization  we increased our valuation allowances for foreign tax credits generated during to for a comparable amount 
accordingly  the net impact on our overall effective tax rate was nominal 
since there was a minimal net impact of discrete items such as uncertain tax positions  our overall effective tax rate of related primarily to operations 
in  we were able to use over of the foreign tax credits generated during the year 
we recognized a benefit of million for the excess foreign tax credits generated 
our overall effective tax rate for was  which was comprised of relating to current period operations and relating to discrete items such as uncertain tax positions and settlements with taxing authorities 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the years ended december  change net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses impairment and facility rationalization charges total operating expenses income from operations other expense  net loss gain on extinguishment of debt net interest expense non operating expenses income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview higher demand caused revenue at both the band and piano divisions to improve in piano division results were significantly better with respect to revenue and gross profit due to increased steinway grand shipments and higher production volume at both of our manufacturing facilities 
band division results were adversely impacted by a strike at its eastlake  ohio brass instrument manufacturing facility  which resulted in less product availability and higher factory variances 
net sales net sales increased million primarily due to the million improvement in piano division revenue 
domestically  steinway grand unit shipments were higher and boston and essex shipments were slightly better than the year ago period 
overall domestic sales improved million  of which is attributable to increased retail sales  which were bolstered by the opening of new company owned retail facilities in chicago  illinois 
overseas  steinway grand unit shipments were higher as a result of increased wholesale demand in europe 
boston and essex unit shipments improved by due to higher demand in both europe and asia 
these increases  coupled with a million favorable impact due to foreign exchange  were the primary cause of a million improvement in overseas piano revenue in band division sales increased million despite a total unit volume decrease of 
overall woodwind and brass instrument shipments were higher due to improved demand for woodwind products 
brass instrument shipments were consistent with the year ago period even though we lost an estimated million in brass instrument revenues due to the unavailability of product caused by the strike at our eastlake  ohio facility 
gross profit gross profit improved million due to higher sales and gross margins at the piano division 
band segment gross profit deteriorated million during the period 
gross margin for the band division decreased from to due to incremental unfavorable plant variances of million primarily associated with eastlake and million in additional pension related charges 
the remaining deterioration was due to higher material and overhead costs 
piano segment gross profit increased million during the period 
domestically  piano margins grew from to due to a shift in mix to steinway grands sold at retail  which typically generate higher margins 
in addition  the factory produced more steinway grands  which resulted in greater factory efficiencies 
overseas piano margins grew from to since our factory in germany also produced and sold more steinway grands 
this improved factory efficiency and generated higher profits 
operating expenses operating expenses were million higher than in the year ago period  of which million is due to severance costs related to the departures of our former chairman and former chief executive officer  and million is incremental stock based compensation 
we also incurred million of legal and consulting costs primarily related to the sale of class a common stock by our former chairman and chief executive officer as well as activities undertaken by our board of directors in pursuit of strategic alternatives 
in addition to the aforementioned costs  sales and marketing expenses increased million due largely to the opening of our new retail facilities in chicago  illinois  as well as higher commissions and salaries  and million less bad debt recoveries 
general and administrative costs were million higher due to increased headcount and higher bonuses 
offsetting this was a decrease in other operating expenses of million  which was primarily attributable to lower environmental reserves recorded during the period 
impairment and facility rationalization charges impairment and facility rationalization charges increased million in the current year 
we wrote down million of trademarks and million of goodwill associated with our online music business  million of property  plant and equipment associated with our woodwind instrument manufacturing facility  million related to band division trademarks and goodwill  and million in assets held for sale by our band division 
in the year ago period we had no impairment charges 
non operating expenses non operating expenses were million higher than the year ago period for several reasons 
we incurred incremental operating expenses of million from our west th street building 
we expect to incur a temporary loss on this facility due to low occupancy rates 
also  our gains from foreign exchange were million lower in we had million in net interest saving due to the extinguishment of million in principal of our senior notes in may  which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of million 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the years ended december  change net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses impairment and facility rationalization charges total operating expenses income from operations other expense income  net gain on extinguishment of debt net interest expense non operating expenses income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview although economic conditions continued to impact our results in  we experienced improvements in both the band and piano divisions  especially during the latter half of the year 
piano division revenue improved due to increased demand and better access to available financing by our dealers 
piano margins also improved due to higher production volume at both of our manufacturing facilities 
band division sales were slightly higher than  but margins improved to a greater extent due to more consistent production schedules  which resulted in better factory efficiency 
net sales net sales increased million primarily due to the million improvement in us piano division revenue 
domestically  steinway grand unit shipments were higher and mid priced piano line shipments were consistent with despite an unfavorable exchange rate impact of million  overseas piano division revenue improved million 
this was largely attributable to a improvement in mid priced piano line shipments which more than offset a decrease in overseas steinway grand unit sales 
band division sales increased million on an overall unit volume increase of 
the unit volume improvement outpaced the revenue improvement due to more cash and promotional discounts issued in gross profit gross profit improved million due to higher sales and gross margins at the piano division and a better gross margin at the band division 
gross margin for the band division increased from to due to more consistent production and greater factory efficiencies at most plants  which contributed million to gross profit 
lower pension expenses also helped improve gross profit in piano segment gross profit increased million during the period 
domestically  piano margins shifted upward from to due to a more consistent production schedule 
although the number of units produced was similar to  production days increased 
this resulted in lower unabsorbed overhead and fewer factory inefficiencies  which benefited the gross margin 
production days overseas increased  which caused a similar margin improvement from to 
nevertheless  a shift in mix toward mid priced piano lines from higher margin steinway grand pianos somewhat offset the impact of greater factory efficiencies on gross profit compared to operating expenses operating expenses were million higher than in a million increase in sales and marketing expenses due to higher salaries  commissions  bonuses  marketing  and advertising costs was partially offset by a million shift from bad debt expense to bad debt recovery 
increased headcount  wages  and bonuses caused a million increase in general and administrative costs  and other operating expenses increased million due to additional environmental reserves recorded for facilities acquired in impairment and facility rationalization charges impairment and facility rationalization charges decreased million 
we wrote down million of trademarks associated with our online music business in  whereas in  we had no impairment charges 
non operating expenses non operating expenses were million higher than in due to several factors 
we experienced a shift from net income to net expense of million from our west th street building 
there was also a million reduction in net gains on extinguishment of debt  which resulted from repurchasing less debt million in vs 
million in at higher rates 
however  net interest expense was million lower as a result of these repurchases and not utilizing our domestic line of credit in we also benefited from a shift from foreign exchange losses to foreign exchange gains of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our working capital lines  to finance our operations  repay or repurchase long term indebtedness  finance acquisitions  and fund our capital expenditures 
regarding our overseas divisions  japan is the only operation that is normally in a borrowing position 
these borrowings are likely to be less than million at any given time 
in  we utilized our domestic line of credit most of the year  and our borrowings reached a high of million  largely to ensure short term liquidity by maintaining a substantial cash balance 
however  we paid down our domestic borrowings in november and december in  our domestic line went unused 
in  we had domestic borrowings for most of the year  as we used a significant portion of our cash to pay down million in principal of our bonds in march  however  our domestic line was paid off by year end 
cash flows our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities in  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million from cash generated from accounts receivable was million lower in the current period due to timing of sales and related accounts receivable collections at the piano division 
cash used for prepaids and other assets increased million as a result of payments made to suppliers and taxes 
cash provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities was million lower due to payments made to inventory suppliers and items related to our west th street building 
in  cash flows provided by operating activities increased million from although the sales increase caused a decrease in source of cash from accounts receivable of million  we also generated million more cash from inventory since the sales improvement helped reduce our finished goods levels 
we experienced a shift from use to source of cash of million related to accounts payable and accrued expenses during the period 
in  we had implemented cost cutting measures to conserve cash and reduce expenditures 
in  spending returned to normal levels 
in  cash flows provided by operating activities increased million from reduced production and purchasing resulted in an improvement of cash provided by inventory of million while cash used for liabilities decreased million due to fewer purchases and controlled spending 
the beneficial impact of these items more than offset the decrease in net income 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million  million of which is due to increased capital expenditures  which were abnormally low in also  cash used for acquisitions was million higher as a result of the additional consideration associated with the acquisition of our online music business and payments made to acquire assets of a piano retail operation in chicago  illinois 
in  cash used for investing activities decreased million  million of which was due to reduced capital expenditures 
the remaining reduction was largely attributable to lower payments for acquisitions 
in we purchased a retail store in dusseldorf  germany 
in  acquisitions were limited to a small music education business purchased by our band division 
in  cash used for investing activities decreased million 
in  we paid out million related to the acquisitions of arkiv and clickpoint 
in  acquisition activity was limited to the purchase of a retail store in dusseldorf  germany for million 
although capital expenditures were million lower than the year ago period  proceeds from sales of property were lower by the same amount 
in  cash used for financing activities of million was primarily attributable to million spent to extinguish a significant portion of our senior notes 
cash provided by our other debt facilities was million lower than in in the year ago period we generated an incremental million through stock sales 
in  cash provided by financing activities increased million  which was derived from million in proceeds received from issuance of our stock and million generated from borrowing on our overseas lines of credit 
these were offset by million used to repurchase million in principal of our senior notes and million used to purchase treasury stock 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased million 
although we received million in proceeds from sales of our stock  we utilized million to pay off our domestic line of credit  million to pay down our overseas borrowings  and million to repurchase million in principal of our senior notes 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of plant and facility improvements  machinery and tooling  and software and system upgrades 
we expect capital spending in to be in the range of to million  relating to similar items 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have higher working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately to million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately to million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers 
a receivable dating payments on purchases made from october through august of the following year are due in october 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing dealers that meet certain credit qualifications may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered primarily in october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
the terms of the notes generally include payment over a nine to twelve month period with interest ranging from to generally to over prime 
interest rates are contingent upon credit ratings and borrowing periods 
in certain situations  we have offered long term arrangements for up to thirty six months 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
other financing arrangements we established a program in to provide financing to certain domestic piano dealers 
as of december   the total financing available to these dealers was approximately million 
beyond this program  we generally do not provide extended financing arrangements to our piano dealers 
typically  if financing is required by a dealer  we will facilitate arrangements through a third party provider 
we generally provide no guarantees with respect to these arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension plan  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our investment committee  and is consistent with that of prior years 
we believe that is consistent with the historical long term return trends on our domestic pension assets and our expectations for future returns 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for our domestic plans is based on a long term bond yield curve which matches the expected benefit payment period under the plan 
the bonds used have been rated aa or aa or better by recognized rating agencies  are non callable  and have at least million par outstanding to ensure they are sufficiently marketable 
the weighted average discount rates used for december  and were and  respectively  for our domestic pension plan and and for our postretirement benefit obligation plan 
our postretirement benefit obligation plan is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average discount rates and as of december  and  respectively and rates of return as of december  and on plan assets for our foreign pension plan was similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur in the applicable jurisdiction 
borrowing activities and availability on october   we entered into a new domestic credit facility with a syndicate of lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans and expires on october  it also provides for borrowings at either london interbank offering rate libor plus a range from to or as needed borrowings at an alternate base rate  plus a range from to  both ranges depend upon availability at the time of borrowing 
borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
our non domestic credit facilities provide for borrowings equivalent to million as of december  there have been no material changes to our net borrowing abilities overseas  and we typically are in a borrowing position of less than million at any given time 
our non domestic credit facilities are discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes due march  and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
we had nothing outstanding on our domestic line of credit as of december  during we extinguished million in principal of our senior note debt 
we may consider additional repurchases or restructuring of our senior note debt in the future  contingent upon cash availability  interest rates  and the trading prices on our senior notes  which are callable at par as of march  cash interest paid was million in  million in  and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities  and to make cash dividend payments 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and do not anticipate any compliance issues in our domestic debt agreements contain limitations on the amount of discretionary repurchases we may make of our ordinary common stock 
our intent and ability to repurchase additional ordinary common stock either directly from shareholders or on the open market is directly affected by this limitation 
in may we announced a share repurchase program which permits us to make discretionary purchases of up to million of our ordinary common stock 
to date  we have repurchased  shares and approximately million remains authorized for repurchases under this program 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
in normal economic conditions  we are able to effectively utilize cash flow from operations to fund our debt and capital requirements and pay off our seasonal borrowings on our domestic line of credit 
we indefinitely reinvest earnings of our foreign operations 
the indefinite reinvestment of these earnings  which were million as of december   does not have a material impact on our liquidity 
should we no longer indefinitely reinvest these earnings  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes associated with these earnings 
however  we do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we believe that domestic cash flow from operations coupled with our domestic borrowing availability is sufficient to fund domestic operating activity through similarly cash flow from overseas operations coupled with our overseas borrowing availability is sufficient to fund overseas operating activity through we intend to manage accounts receivable and credit risk and ensure inventory levels align with demand 
our intention is to manage cash outflow  maintain sufficient operating cash on hand to meet short term requirements  and minimize credit facility borrowings 
we do not have any current plans or intentions that will have a material adverse impact on our liquidity in  although we may consider acquisitions or debt restructurings that may require funding from operations or from our credit facilities 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility and non domestic credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other non current liabilities total notes to contractual obligations long term debt represents long term debt obligations  the fixed interest on our senior notes  and the variable interest on our other loans 
we estimated the future variable interest obligation using the applicable december  rates 
the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the land lease associated with steinway hall  which has eighty six years remaining  and is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of firm purchase commitments for raw materials  finished goods  and equipment 
our other non current liabilities consist primarily of the long term portion of our pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  and obligations under employee and consultant agreements  which are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
we have not included million of uncertain tax positions within this schedule due to the uncertainty of the payment date  if any 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies based on the definition above 
accounts receivable we establish allowances for accounts receivable and notes receivable 
we review overall collectibility trends and customer characteristics such as debt leverage  solvency  and outstanding balances in order to develop our estimates 
historically  a large portion of our sales at both our piano and band divisions has been generated by our top customers 
as a result  we experience some inherent concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable due to its composition and the relative proportion of large customer receivables to the total 
this is especially true at our band division  which characteristically has a majority of our consolidated accounts receivable balance 
we consider the credit health and solvency of our customers when developing our receivable allowance estimates 
inventory we establish inventory reserves for items such as lower of cost or market and obsolescence 
we review inventory levels on a detailed basis  concentrating on the age and amounts of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods  as well as recent usage and sales dates and quantities to help develop our estimates 
ongoing changes in our business strategy  including a shift from batch processing to single piece production flow  coupled with increased offshore sourcing  could affect our ability to realize the current cost of our inventory  and are considered by management when developing our estimates 
we also establish reserves for anticipated book to physical adjustments based upon our historical level of adjustments from our annual physical inventories 
we account for our inventory using standard costs 
accordingly  variances between actual and standard costs that are normal in nature are capitalized into inventory and released based on calculated inventory turns 
abnormal costs are expensed in the period in which they occur 
workers compensation and self insured health claims we establish self insured workers compensation and health claims reserves based on our trend analysis of data provided by third party administrators regarding historical claims and anticipated future claims 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the estimated future cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
we establish long lived intangible assets based on estimated fair values  and amortize finite lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived trademark assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset may have decreased below its carrying value 
we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments  and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we aggregate components within a reporting unit that have similar economic characteristics 
our assessment is based on a comparison of net book value to estimated fair values primarily using an income approach 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our discounted cash flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use estimates of market participant weighted average costs of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows  adjusted for the risks and uncertainty inherent in our industry generally and in our internally developed forecasts 
we also use a market approach against which we benchmark the results of our income approach to ensure that the results are appropriate 
pensions and other postretirement benefit costs we make certain assumptions when calculating our benefit obligations and expenses 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as discount rates and long term rates of return  on information provided by our actuaries  investment advisors  investment committee  current rate trends  and historical trends for our pension asset portfolios 
our benefit obligations and expenses can fluctuate based on the assumptions management selects 
income taxes when appropriate  we record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards 
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
the ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon many factors  including the ratio of foreign source income to overall income and generation of sufficient future taxable income in the jurisdictions for which we have loss carryforwards 
when establishing or adjusting valuation allowances  we consider these factors  as well as anticipated trends in foreign source income and tax planning strategies which may impact future realizability of these assets 
a liability has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 
when analyzing these positions  we consider the probability of various outcomes which could result from examination  negotiation  or settlement with various taxing authorities 
the final outcome of these positions could differ significantly from our original estimates due to the following expiring statutes of limitations  availability of detailed historical data  results of audits or examinations conducted by taxing authorities or agents that vary from management s anticipated results  identification of new tax contingencies  release of applicable administrative tax guidance  management s decision to settle or appeal assessments  the rendering of court decisions affecting our estimates of tax liabilities  or other factors 
environmental liabilities we make certain assumptions when calculating our environmental liabilities 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as cost and length of time for remediation  on data provided by our environmental consultants  as well as information provided by regulatory authorities 
we also make certain assumptions regarding the indemnifications we have received from others  including whether remediation costs are within the scope of the indemnification  the indemnifier s ability to perform under the agreement  and whether past claims have been successful 
our environmental obligations and expenses can fluctuate based on management s assumptions 
we believe the assumptions made by management provide a reasonable basis for the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements certain amendments to accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements  become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december  these amendments include a consistent definition of fair value  enhanced disclosure requirements for level fair value adjustments and other changes to required disclosures 
in june  asc  comprehensive income  was amended and will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december  these amendments will require us to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
as a result of the amendment  the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity will be eliminated 
in addition  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to accounting standards update asu that defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
asu will be applied retrospectively  and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  in september  asc  intangibles goodwill and others  was amended to simplify the assessment of goodwill impairment and will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december  the amended guidance allows us to do an initial qualitative assessment of relative events and circumstances to determine if fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value  prior to performing the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
in december  asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities was issued 
this asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
asu no 
will be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january  we will comply with the requirements of these pronouncements when they become effective 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate some of our cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by holding forward and option foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the contracts relate primarily to intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would increase the fair value of the contracts by million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current forward rate 
however  any such gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related asset or liability 
interest risk our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
our revolving loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in prime  libor  tibor  and euribor and are therefore sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
since we had limited variable rate borrowings for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by a nominal amount 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these senior notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by less than million as of december
