on february   we received written notice from sun microsystems that they had elected to terminate the global inside sales program statement of work agreement dated march   effective as of february  the notice followed the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle corporation and affected the contract sales services that we were performing for sun microsystems 
the global inside sales program services accounted for approximately of our fiscal annual net revenue

the settlement payment was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of in addition  oracle agreed to reimburse us  for employee severance costs related to terminating employees who worked on the global inside sales program 
this reimbursement was recognized in payroll and payroll tax expense to offset the employee severance costs 
we reported net revenue of million in  representing an decline over the prior year due primarily to customer losses including the loss of sun microsystems during we reported a net loss of million for we reported net revenue of million in  representing an decline over the prior year due primarily the loss of sun microsystems during we reported a net loss of million for net revenue we derive substantially all of our revenue from i the online sale of our clients products to their smb customers  ii the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals  iii lead development and other telesales services  and iv software subscriptions for hosted internet sales of web based training 
ecommerce and service contract renewals contract sales 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  i our clients products through online sales and ii our clients service contracts and maintenance renewals 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our net revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our clients customers 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the amount payable by our clients customer based on the agreement with our client 
we record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale 
none of our clients customers represented more than of our net revenue in because our revenue is commission based  it can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have one to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on days notice by either party 
we also provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development and other telesales services 
we provide lead development and other telesales services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 
some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation and other telesales service agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
these agreements are generally terminable on days notice by either party 
application software training sales 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one to three year terms  and are often fully or annually paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
gross margin gross margin is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products and services or delivering our services to our clients 
cost of services include compensation costs of telesales personnel  telesales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs of services are personnel related and are mostly variable in relation to our net revenue 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are typically related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margin will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  marketing and promotional expenses  and participation in trade shows and conferences 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our solutions 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we also invest in the continued development of our solutions 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  and legal  audit and other professional fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment  software licenses and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of several businesses in the past five years  and accordingly have been amortizing the intangible assets  other than goodwill  acquired in these transactions 
in january  we purchased optima which added  to our amortizable intangible assets 
see the discussion below under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on debt and capital lease agreements  foreign currency gains losses and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with gaap  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition and financial statement presentation  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  and fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options  our common stock warrant liability and the optima contingent consideration 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from i the online sale of our clients products to their smb customers  ii the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals  iii lead development and other telesales services  and iv software subscriptions for hosted internet sales of web based training 
revenue is recorded using the proportional performance model  where revenue is recognized as performance occurs over the term of the contract and any initial set up fees are recognized over the estimated customer life 
we recognize revenue from the online sale of our clients products and the sale of our clients service contracts and maintenance renewals on the net basis  which represents the amount billed to the end customer less the amount paid to our client 
revenue from the sale is recognized when a purchase order from a client s customer is received  the service or service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development and other telesales services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our software application subscriptions of hosted online sales of web based training ratably over each contract period 
since these software subscriptions are usually paid in advance  we have recorded a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of subscriptions that will be earned over the next one to three years 
our agreements typically do not contain multiple deliverables 
in the few instances where our agreements have contained multiple deliverables  they do not have value to our customers on a standalone basis  and therefore the deliverables are considered together as one unit of accounting 
however  we may enter into sales contracts with multiple deliverable element conditions with stand alone value in the future  which may affect the timing of our revenue recognition and may have an impact on our future financial statements 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectability 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our clients customers and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition  we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers or clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our clients or our clients customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  internal use software and fasb asc  website development costs 
this guidance requires that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of fasb asc and asc have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of the related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific outsource client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
goodwill and other intangible assets we completed several acquisitions during the period of february through january goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
most recently  in january  we acquired optima consulting partners  assigning million to goodwill and  to amortizable intangible assets 
in our analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets  we apply the guidance of fasb asc in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
in our analysis of other finite lived amortizable intangible assets  we apply the guidance of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and trade names of the businesses we have acquired 
as of both december  and  we had accumulated impairment losses of million 
in the fourth quarter of and again in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and concluded that our remaining goodwill balance was not impaired at such time 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill recorded on our contract sales reporting unit and million in goodwill recorded on our rainmaker europe reporting unit 
based on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that the estimated fair values of the contract sales and rainmaker europe reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
we report segment results in accordance with fasb asc  segment reporting 
the method for determining what information is reported is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments for making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance 
our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis  accompanied by detailed information listing revenues by customer and product line  for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
currently  the chief operating decision maker does not use product line financial performance as a primary basis for business operating decisions 
accordingly  we have concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment 
however  in accordance with fasb asc  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
thus  our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are contract sales  lead development  rainmaker asia and rainmaker europe 
long lived assets long lived assets  including our purchased intangible assets  are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsequent measurement  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our long lived assets and noted no impairment 
based on information we received on april  from marketlead in which we invested in in the form of a secured note and a minority equity investment  we took a non cash charge in the first quarter of of  for the carrying value of our minority equity investment 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
the liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in and  the deferred tax asset was subject to a valuation allowance and therefore is not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is limited and we may not be able to fully utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce our tax rates 
fasb asc  income taxes  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under this guidance  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy for recording interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes 
penalties  interest paid and interest received are recorded in interest and other expense  net  in the statement of operations 
interest and penalties recorded as of december  and were immaterial 
stock based compensation fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this statement 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries was determined to be their respective local currencies canadian dollar  philippine peso and great britain pound 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period 
the related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in interest and other expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant client concentrations we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers of a limited number of clients 
in the year ended december   two clients accounted for or more of our revenue  with microsoft representing approximately of our net revenue and symantec representing approximately of our net revenue 
during the year ended december   three clients accounted for or more of our net revenue  with sun microsystems representing approximately of our net revenue  hewlett packard representing approximately of our net revenue and symantec representing approximately of our net revenue 
in  three clients accounted for or more of our net revenue  with sun microsystems representing approximately of our net revenue  hewlett packard representing approximately of our net revenue and symantec accounting for approximately of our net revenue 
no individual client s end user customer accounted for or more of our net revenue in any period presented 
we had various agreements with sun microsystems  our largest client during  with various termination provisions 
on february   we received written notice from sun microsystems that they had elected to terminate the global inside sales program statement of work agreement dated march   effective as of february  the notice followed the acquisition of sun microsystems by oracle corporation and affected the contract sales services that we were performing for sun microsystems 
the global inside sales agreement had a minimum term with notice periods to august  we entered into a settlement agreement on march   and received a cash payment of  from oracle corporation for the buyout of the global inside sales agreement 
the settlement payment was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of in addition  oracle agreed to reimburse us  for employee severance costs related to terminating employees who worked on the global inside sales program 
this reimbursement was recognized in payroll and payroll tax expense to offset the employee severance costs 
we have outsourced services agreements with our significant clients that expire at various dates ranging through june our agreements with symantec expire in march and can generally be terminated prior to expiration with ninety days notice 
our agreements with microsoft expire at various dates from june through august  and generally can be terminated with thirty days notice 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
related party transactions in june  we issued and sold million shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase up to an aggregate million additional shares  in a public offering 
members of our board of directors purchased  shares at a price of per share 
they also received warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares with an initial exercise price of per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our equity offering 
in october  we closed an oem licensing agreement with marketlead  inc marketlead  a software as a service provider of bb automated marketing solutions  to further enhance leadworks  rainmaker s on demand marketing automation application 
in connection with this agreement  rainmaker provided marketlead with growth financing of million in secured convertible and term debt 
in october  one half of the debt was converted into preferred shares of marketlead 
in may  we received payment from marketlead for the  in remaining term debt plus accrued interest of approximately  in connection with the acquisition of marketlead by a third party 
in connection with this acquisition  we took a non cash charge in the first quarter of of  for the carrying value of our minority equity investment

excluding this one time settlement payment  contract sales revenue decreased million  or  compared to primarily due to the loss of sun microsystems as a client in the first quarter of lead development product line net revenue increased predominantly from revenue from microsoft 
net revenue from our training sales product line declined as compared to the prior year due to customer attrition 
cost of services and gross margin 
cost of services increased  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
our gross margin percentage decreased to in the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the one time settlement payment for the contract termination buyout received in the first quarter of and discontinued client program revenue in the second quarter of with no associated costs 
excluding the one time payment received during the first quarter of and the discontinued client program revenue in the second quarter of  gross margin would have approximated for the year ended we estimate that gross margin will improve during due to our cost saving initiatives and our forecasted revenue mix 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the increase was primarily due to approximately  in overall personnel costs resulting from our investment in sales and marketing staff and increased corporate marketing costs of  we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in as compared to due to our cost saving initiatives in the fourth quarter of technology and development expenses 
technology and development expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in personnel and consultant costs 
we expect technology and development expenses to decrease in as compared to due to and cost savings initiatives 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs of  due to reductions in our workforce  as well as a  reduction of costs related to the exit of our canadian facility 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in as compared to due to and cost savings initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
depreciation expense decreased due to software and equipment assets becoming fully depreciated in both the us and philippines 
amortization of intangible assets decreased as certain assets were fully amortized 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease significantly during as compared to due to lower and planned capital expenditures 
loss gain on fair value re measurement 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a loss on fair value re measurement of  related to the change in the accrued estimated liability for the potential earnout payment in connection with our acquisition of optima based on performance to date and projections of performance through during the year ended december   the company had recorded a  gain on re measurement of this liability 
we do not expect a change in the fair value re measurement in as the earn out period ended on december gain due to change in fair value of warrant liability 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of our warrant liability of  in june  we issued million warrants as part of our equity offering 
we classified the warrants as liabilities under the balance sheet caption common stock warrant liability and estimated their fair value  as of the balance sheet date  utilizing the black scholes valuation method 
interest and other expense  net 
the components of interest and other expense  net are as follows in thousands year ended december  change interest income interest expense currency transaction gain loss write down of investment other net interest expense was relatively flat for the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period  as increases from incremental and new borrowings were offset by decreases in interest rates 
currency transaction gain loss is primarily due to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates among the us dollar  the philippine peso and the british pound 
fluctuations of currency exchange rates may have a negative effect in future periods on our financial results 
in may  we received payment from marketlead for  in remaining term debt plus accrued interest of approximately  in connection with the acquisition of marketlead by a third party 
in connection with this acquisition  we wrote off the carrying value of our minority equity investment of  in this company 
we no longer carry any values on our balance sheet related to marketlead 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was driven by the change of net revenue in compared to  as well as several income tax refunds 
even though we incurred book and tax losses over the last three years  we have not recorded any deferred tax benefits for such losses due to management s assessment that deferred tax assets are not more than likely to be realized in the future 
therefore  we recorded no deferred tax benefits for the losses 
our income tax expense for the year ended december  primarily consists of estimates of foreign taxes  which include  but are not limited to  gross income taxes for one of our foreign subsidiaries  and certain state minimum and franchise taxes which are determined largely based on gross income rather than net loss 
we expect income tax expense to increase during as compared to as we do not expect the benefit of tax refunds
