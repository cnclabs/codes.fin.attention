during the fourth fiscal quarter of  net income was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in the prior year period 
segment earnings operating earnings excluding corporate expenses and other income or expense totaled million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  in the prior year period 
the increase in segment earnings reflected improved operating earnings from avionics controls and advanced materials 
operating earnings of sensors systems increased due to incremental earnings from the souriau acquisition and the fiscal effect of acquisition related expenses incurred  as well as improved results of advanced sensors and a recovery of non recurring engineering expenses from a customer in fiscal avionics controls results benefited from solid earnings from our avionics software testing business compared to an operating loss in the prior year period 
avionics controls results also benefited from foreign currency exchange gains on embedded derivatives and monetary assets and lower research  development and engineering for avionics systems 
advanced materials benefited from shipping previously delayed international shipments of flare countermeasure devices in the fourth quarter 
the income tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter of was compared to in the prior year period 
our income tax rate in the fourth quarter was favorably impacted by a million release of valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits as a result of a tax examination 
during fiscal  net income was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  during fiscal the decrease in net income reflected a million  or per diluted share  impairment charge against goodwill of racal acoustics  our military headset business  which is included in our avionics controls segment 
excluding the impairment charge  segment earnings totaled million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal  reflecting weaker sales and earnings from avionics controls and strong results from sensors systems and advanced materials 
sales and earnings in the fourth quarter increased over the fourth quarter of the prior year 
this compared with weaker sales and earnings in each of the first  second and third quarters of fiscal against the respective corresponding quarters in avionics controls full year results were impacted by lower sales and earnings of the t b military trainer and retrofits of military transport aircraft 
sensors systems sales and earnings benefited principally due to the inclusion of full year results from souriau 
this business was acquired in july  and the inventory fair value adjustment was principally recorded in the prior year period 
sensors systems sales and earnings also benefited from improved sales and earnings of advanced sensors and power systems 
the increase in advanced materials mainly reflected strong sales and earnings from higher sales of engineered materials 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year period

sales by segment were as follows in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the million  or decrease  in avionics controls mainly reflected decreased sales volumes of avionics systems of million and communication systems offset by an increase in sales volumes of control systems 
the decrease in avionics systems was principally due to lower cockpit integration sales volumes for the t b military trainer and retrofits for military transport aircraft 
the decrease in sales for the t b was due the bankruptcy filing of hawker beechcraft 
the decrease in segment sales also reflected a million decrease in sales of hearing protection headsets due to reduced demand and order delays  of which about was offset by higher sales of communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications 
the increase in control systems sales was mainly due to higher sales to oem customers 
the prior year period benefited from a million retroactive price settlement due to product scope changes 
the million  or increase  in sensors systems principally reflected incremental sales from the souriau acquisition of million and increased sales volume of advanced sensors and power systems of million 
about of the increase in advanced sensors and power systems sales reflected increased sales of power systems due to higher demand for commercial aviation products 
the increase in advanced sensors reflected higher oem sales and strong aftermarket demand for aerospace and industrial customers

foreign sales originating from non us locations  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled billion and million  and accounted for and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million compared to million in the prior year period 
the decrease in gross profit was mainly due to lower sales volumes for the t b military trainer cockpit and retrofits of military aircraft  partially offset by increased gross profit of our avionics software testing business 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
approximately of the increase in gross profit reflected strong demand for power systems for commercial aviation applications 
approximately of the increase in gross profit was due to incremental gross profit from the souriau acquisition 
souriau s gross profit was impacted by a million charge in the first fiscal quarter of due to recording souriau s acquired inventory at its fair value 
the prior year period included a million inventory fair value adjustment  recognized principally in the fourth fiscal quarter of advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit was principally due to higher sales of elastomer materials and insulation materials primarily for commercial aviation applications 
gross profit on defense technologies increased slightly  principally reflecting an increase in gross profit and margin on flare countermeasures  partially offset by lower gross profit on combustible ordnance due to decreased sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense principally reflected a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense at our sensors systems segment due to incremental selling  general and administrative expense from the souriau acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million at avionics controls and advanced materials 
this increase reflects a million increase in bad debt due to the bankruptcy filing of hawker beechcraft  million in incremental selling  general and administrative expense from the eclipse acquisition  and million in severance costs

the increase in engineered materials earnings reflected the increase in gross profit 
the prior year period benefited from a million gain on sale of a facility  partially offset by a million increase in an estimated liability for an environmental issue  which was paid in fiscal the improvement in results for defense technologies principally reflected an increase in earnings for countermeasures operations partially offset by decreased earnings of combustible ordnance of million 
prior to our march acquisition of cmc  cmc was involved in a transaction in which cmc shareholders had a limited amount of time in which to tender their shares in exchange for cash 
in may  after the prescribed time period had expired  cad million remained unclaimed 
as a result  the paying agent returned the unclaimed amount to cmc in accordance with canadian law 
in december  cmc s former parent company instituted a legal action against the paying agent  alleging negligence and breached contract terms by returning the funds to cmc 
the plaintiff lost at trial and appealed 
in the second quarter of fiscal  cmc received notice that the plaintiff abandoned its appeal 
in addition  cmc and the paying agent settled all remaining issues 
management concluded that all contingencies relating to this matter were resolved  and accordingly  the company recorded a gain of approximately cad million or million  or million after tax  in the second fiscal quarter of interest expense increased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting higher borrowings 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
during fiscal  we recognized million of discrete income tax benefits as a result of the following items the first item was a million tax benefit due to a change in french tax laws associated with the holding company structure and the financing of the souriau acquisition 
the second item was a million reduction of the uk statutory income tax rate 
the third item was a million tax benefit as a result of reconciling the prior year s income tax return to the us income tax provision and settlement of tax examinations 
the fourth item was a million release of valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits as a result of a tax examination 
in fiscal  we recognized million of discrete income tax benefits as result of the following items 
the first item was million of income tax benefits due to the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation credits and the release of a valuation allowance related to a net operating loss of an acquired subsidiary 
the second item was million of income tax benefits associated with net operating losses of an acquired subsidiary as a result of concluding a tax examination 
the third item was million of net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of a reduction in the uk statutory income tax rate 
the fourth item was million of income tax expense as a result of reconciling the prior year s income tax returns to the prior year s provision for income tax 
we expect the income tax rate to be approximately in fiscal it is reasonably possible that within the next months approximately million of tax benefits associated with research and experimentation tax credits  capital and operating losses that are currently unrecognized could be recognized as a result of settlement of examinations and or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
if these tax benefits were to be recognized during fiscal  fiscal expected income tax rate could decrease to approximately to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and were as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders increased across all of our segments

this reflects increased sales volumes of aviation products and higher gross margin on cockpit integration sales 
nearly of the increase in segment gross profit reflected robust sales of control systems due to strong aftermarket demand and the million retroactive price increase referenced above 
control systems gross profit was impacted by a million charge in the fourth fiscal quarter of for engineering costs not probable of recovery from the customer 
eclipse s gross profit was impacted by purchase accounting requirements resulting in a million inventory fair value adjustment and recognizing the adjustment as expense over the first inventory turn  approximately million was recorded as an expense in the fourth fiscal quarter of interface technologies gross profit decreased by approximately million  principally due to lower demand and gross margin for interface devices for casino gaming applications 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
connection technologies reported only minimal gross profit  net of a million inventory fair value adjustment  principally recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of an additional million in fair value adjustments was recognized in the first fiscal quarter of approximately of the increase in segment gross profit was due to increased sales volumes of pressure sensors for oem and aftermarket requirements 
about of the increase in segment gross profit was due to improved gross margin on power systems from increased retrofit and oem sales 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
a million increase in engineered materials gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit at our defense technologies operations 
the increase in engineered materials gross profit was principally due to increased sales volumes of elastomer and insulation material for commercial aerospace applications 
the decrease in gross profit of defense technologies mainly reflected lower sales volumes of countermeasures 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the million increase reflected increases of million of corporate expense  million in our avionics controls segment  and million in our sensors systems segment 
the million increase at corporate primarily reflects souriau acquisition related expenses  of which approximately million was incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of the million increase in avionics controls reflects million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related to the eclipse acquisition 
the million increase in sensors systems reflects million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related to the souriau acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses in advanced materials increased slightly compared to the prior year period reflecting million for an estimated liability for an environmental issue  million in severance at our defense technologies operations and a million expense principally related to the write off of accounts receivable 
these increases were principally offset by a million gain on a sale of a facility and an insurance recovery in fiscal research  development and related engineering spending increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the million increase in research  development and related engineering expense principally reflects million in higher spending on avionics systems  million on control systems and million on communication systems 
in fiscal we benefited from million in foreign currency exchange gains associated with funding the acquisition of souriau 
segment earnings operating earnings excluding corporate expenses and other income or expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for the prior year period 
the million decrease in earnings mainly reflected the operating loss of souriau of million  principally due to the fair value inventory adjustment noted above and partially offset by incremental earnings of eclipse of million 
the decrease also reflected weaker operating earnings at our avionics systems and communications headset operations totaling million and defense technologies countermeasure operations totaling million  partially offset by stronger operating results at our engineered materials operations of million 
avionics systems earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by higher research and development expense and lower shipments of the integrated cockpit for the t b military trainer compared to the same periods last year 
the decrease at communication systems and defense technologies was due to lower demand for headsets and flare countermeasures  respectively  which reflect slower than expected order releases from our defense customers 
engineered materials operations benefited from strong demand for elastomer and insulation materials for commercial aerospace 
the decrease in segment earnings also reflected a million write off of engineering costs at controls systems  a million inventory and accounts receivable write off at advanced sensors  a million write off of accounts receivable and inventory at defense technologies  and a million late delivery penalty at engineering materials  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of an engineered materials facility 
segment earnings for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal avionics controls segment earnings were million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal  mainly reflecting a million increase in earnings from sales of avionics systems  a million increase in earnings from sales of control systems  partially offset by a million decrease in earnings from sales of communication systems  and a million decrease in earnings from sales of interface technologies 
avionics systems benefited from strong gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in research  development and engineering expense and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  reflecting increased bid and proposal expense and incentive compensation

defense technologies principally reflected a million decrease in earnings for countermeasures operations and increased earnings from combustible ordnance 
the decrease in earnings for countermeasures mainly reflected the decrease in gross profit and certain charges in the fourth fiscal quarter of totaling million  consisting principally of a write off of an accounts receivable of million and million in inventory 
also  million in severance was recorded in the third fiscal quarter of interest expense increased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting higher borrowings 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
during fiscal  we recognized million of discrete income tax benefits as a result of the following items million of income tax benefits due to the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation credits and the release of a valuation allowance related to a net operating loss of an acquired subsidiary  million of income tax benefits associated with net operating losses of an acquired subsidiary as a result of concluding a tax examination  million of net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities as a result of enactment of income tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate  and million of income tax expense as a result of reconciling the prior year s income tax returns to the prior year s provision for income tax 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of four events 
the first event was a million benefit as a result of the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions mainly associated with losses on the disposition of assets 
this release of tax reserves resulted from the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the second event was a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities  which was the result of the enactment of tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate 
the third event was a million tax expense related to tax liabilities associated with an examination of the us federal and state income tax returns 
the fourth event was a million reduction of valuation allowances related to acquired net operating losses and foreign tax credits that were generated in prior years 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and were as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders increased across all of our segments  principally reflecting the acquired backlog of eclipse and souriau and partially offset by order declines for avionics systems  certain communication systems and defense technologies 
backlog at the end of fiscal was billion compared with billion at the end of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal totaled million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
net working capital increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of the prior year 
cash flows from operating activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
sources of cash flows from operating activities principally consist of cash received from the sale of products offset by cash payments for material  labor and operating expenses 
cash flows used by investing activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively

cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected a million increase in our credit facility  million in proceeds for the issuance of long term debt and million in cash repayments of long term debt 
capital expenditures net property  plant and equipment was million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of the prior year 
capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively excluding acquisitions and included facilities  machinery  equipment and enhancements to information technology systems 
capital expenditures are anticipated to approximate million for fiscal  which includes plant expansions  as well as deferred capital spending from and we will continue to support expansion through investments in infrastructure including machinery  equipment  and information systems 
acquisitions on july   the company acquired the souriau group souriau for approximately million  net of acquired cash 
souriau is a leading global supplier of highly engineered connection technologies for harsh environments 
souriau is included in our sensors systems segment 
on december   the company acquired eclipse electronic systems  inc eclipse for million 
eclipse is a designer and manufacturer of embedded communication intercept receivers for signal intelligence applications 
eclipse is included in our avionics controls segment 
debt financing total debt decreased million from the prior year to approximately million at the end of fiscal total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal consisted of million senior notes due in  million of senior notes due in  million million under our euro term loan  million in borrowings under our secured credit facility  million under capital lease obligations  million government refundable advances  and million in various foreign currency debt agreements and other debt agreements 
in july  we amended the secured credit facility to provide for a new million term loan euro term loan 
the interest rate on the euro term loan ranges from euro libor plus to euro libor plus depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   the company had million outstanding or million under the euro term loan at an interest rate of euro libor plus or 
the loan amortizes at of the original principal balance quarterly through march  with the remaining balance due in july in march  we entered into a secured credit facility for million made available through a group of banks 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and interest is based on standard inter bank offering rates 
the interest rate ranges from libor plus to libor plus depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   we had million outstanding under the secured credit facility at an initial interest rate of libor plus or 
on august   the company issued million in senior notes due requiring semi annual interest payments in march and september of each year until maturity 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes  after deducting million of debt issuance cost  were million 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to august   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
in addition  before august   the company may redeem up to of the principal amount at plus accrued interest with proceeds of one or more public equity offerings 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after august   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning august   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after august  the company also has million outstanding of senior notes due in  with an interest rate of 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rates on the senior notes due in for variable interest rates 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after march   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning march   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after march  we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal current conditions in the capital markets are uncertain  however  we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
permanent investment of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries our non us subsidiaries have million in cash and cash equivalents at october  cash and cash equivalents at our us parent and subsidiaries aggregated million at october   and cash flow from these operations is sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt repayments of our domestic operations 
we have available credit to our us parent and subsidiaries of million on our us secured credit facility 
the earnings of our non us subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely invested  and accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practical to determine because of the complexities regarding the calculation of unremitted earnings and the potential for tax credits 
government refundable advances government refundable advances consist of payments received from the canadian government to assist in research and development related to commercial aviation 
these advances totaled million and million at october   and october   respectively 
the repayment of the advances is based on year over year commercial aviation revenue growth at cmc beginning in imputed interest on the advances was at october  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline and non us plans maintained by cmc 
our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements for the plans maintained by esterline and cmc to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type  and accordingly  believe a to assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate for both the esterline and cmc plans 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our esterline pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we made the following assumptions with respect to our cmc pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense

seasonality the timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers and  as a result  we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year 
moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters

currency risks we own significant operations in canada  france and the united kingdom 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
furthermore  we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies 
at october   we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk us dollar denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  and certain forward contracts  which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro increased to at october   from at october   the dollar relative to the uk pound increased to from  and the dollar relative to the canadian dollar increased to from 
foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets and forward contracts resulted in a million loss in fiscal  a million gain in fiscal  and a million gain in fiscal the million gain in fiscal included a million gain due to our holding euros to fund the souriau acquisition 
our policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions using forward exchange contracts with maturities up to months 
the company does not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes 
at october   and october   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and million  respectively 
the net fair value of these contracts was a million asset and a million asset at october   and october   respectively 
if the us dollar increased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be an increase of million 
if the us dollar decreased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be a decrease of million

contract rate total fair value at the company has no derivative contracts maturing after fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
when change orders have been approved by both the company and the customer for both scope and price and realization is deemed probable  the original contract price is adjusted and revenues are recognized on contract performance as determined by the achievement of contractual milestones and the cost to cost method 
for partially approved change orders  costs attributable to unpriced change orders are treated as costs of the contract performance in the period the costs are incurred 
claims are also recognized as contract revenue when approved by both the company and the customer  based on contract performance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory cost adjustments 
inventory cost adjustments are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated billion of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
during the third fiscal quarter of  management performed a step one impairment test for racal acoustics upon identification of an indicator of impairment  since racal acoustics third quarter forecast projected an operating loss for fiscal additionally  management determined that requirements for hearing protection devices for the us army would not recover in our five year planning horizon in light of the cancellation of humvee retrofits  delays in vis x and the slowdown in operational tempo of the us armed forces as well as a global slowdown in defense spending 
the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill resulted in an impairment charge of million 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of july   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our other reporting units 
our souriau reporting unit s margin in passing the step one analysis was about  mainly reflecting lower market valuation assumptions in management expects that continued improvements in operations will result in favorable actual results compared to our original plan 
it is possible  however  that as a result of events or circumstances  we could conclude at a later date that goodwill of million at souriau may be considered impaired 
we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reasons  we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 
these other assets include trade names of million and intangible assets of million 
our cmc reporting unit s margin in passing the step one analysis was about  mainly reflecting lower forecast operating results due to the delay in booking new cockpit integration retrofits for military transport aircraft 
management expects that new opportunities for cockpit integration will result in favorable actual results compared to our original plan 
it is possible  however  that as a result of events or circumstances  we could conclude at a later date that goodwill of million at cmc may be considered impaired 
we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reasons  we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 
these other assets include trade names of million and intangible assets of million 
our eclipse electronic systems  inc eclipse reporting unit s margin in passing the step one analysis was about  mainly reflecting lower forecast operating results due to uncertainty over defense spending beginning in fiscal management expects new opportunities for embedded communication intercept signal intelligence applications will result in more favorable results compared to our current forecast 
it is possible  however  that as a result of events or circumstances  we could conclude at a later date that goodwill of million at eclipse may be considered impaired 
we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reasons  we determined the value of intangible assets of up to million has been impaired 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
we used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our annual impairment test 
we believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
except for souriau and cmc  the fair value of all our reporting units exceeds its book value by greater than 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our other reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our other reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in any of our other reporting units to be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the first step step one of an impairment test of long lived assets is to determine the amount of future undiscounted cash flow of the long lived asset 
in the event the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset  a second step is required step two  and the long lived asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date 
we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci  requiring presentation of comprehensive income in either a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or on separate but consecutive statements  the statement of operations and the statement of oci 
the amendment is effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows and only impacts the presentation of oci on the financial statements
