item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
retail revenues retail customers are classified as residential  commercial  or industrial  with no single customer representing more than of pge s total retail revenues or of total retail deliveries 
commercial and industrial customer classes are not dominated by any single industry 
while the largest commercial and industrial customers constituted of total retail revenues in  they represented nine different groups  including high technology  paper manufacturing  metal fabrication  health services  and governmental agencies 

table of contents averages over the past three year period by customer class are as follows  with energy deliveries and revenues expressed as a percentage of the totals average number of customers energy deliveries revenues residential commercial industrial in accordance with state regulations  pge s retail customer prices are determined through general rate case proceedings and various tariffs filed with the opuc from time to time  and are based on the company s cost of service 
additionally  the company offers different pricing options 
under pge s daily market price option  the company delivered electricity to commercial and industrial customers in  representing of commercial and industrial deliveries and less than of total retail energy deliveries 
under the renewable energy options  approximately  residential and small commercial customers were enrolled compared to  and  as of december   and  respectively 
under time of use options  approximately  customers were enrolled compared to  and  as of december   and  respectively 
for additional information on customer options  see retail customer choice program within the regulation and rates section of this item additional information on the customer classes follows 
residential customers include single family housing  multiple family housing such as apartments  duplexes  and town homes  mobile homes  and small farms 
residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather  with demand historically highest during the winter heating season 
due to the increased use of air conditioning in pge s service territory  the summer peaks have increased in recent years 
economic conditions can also affect demand from the company s residential customers  as historical data suggests that high unemployment rates contribute to a decrease in demand 
residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  however  the company s decoupling mechanism is intended to mitigate the financial effects of such measures 
during  total residential deliveries increased compared to as a result of cooler weather during the heating season  and an increase in the average number of customers 
during  total residential deliveries decreased compared to  with milder weather conditions accounting for nearly half of the decrease 
commercial customers consist of non residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers 
this customer class consists of most businesses  including small industrial companies  and public street and highway lighting accounts 
demand from the company s commercial customers is less susceptible to weather conditions than the residential class 
economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to corresponding changes in energy demand from commercial customers 
commercial demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  the financial effects of which are partially mitigated by the company s decoupling mechanism 
in  favorable weather effects combined with the addition of an average of nearly new customers contributed to the increase in deliveries to commercial customers 
during  non farm employment increased in oregon 

table of contents during  as the oregon economy lost approximately of its payroll  the company s commercial energy deliveries decreased compared to with milder weather  including a very cool summer in  contributing about one third of the decline 
industrial customers consist of non residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers  with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered and the applicable tariff 
demand from industrial customers is primarily affected by economic conditions  with weather having little impact on this customer class 
a change in economic activity in oregon and the united states can also lead to a change in energy demand from the company s industrial customers 
in  industrial deliveries rose as demand increased from certain paper production customers  and the general economic conditions improved 
in  the company s industrial energy deliveries rose compared to  driven by increased demand from certain paper production customers in the latter half of other accrued revenues  net include items that are not currently in customer prices  but are expected to be in prices in a future period 
such amounts include deferrals recorded under regulatory mechanisms for the renewable adjustment clause  the power cost adjustment  and decoupling 
see state of oregon regulation in the regulation and rates section of this item for further information on these items 
other accrued revenues also include deferrals recorded pursuant to the residential exchange program rep 
under the rep  the bonneville power administration bpa provides federal hydropower benefits to residential and small farm customers of certain investor owned electric utilities that are expected to continue until the year pge receives monthly payments from bpa under the program and passes such payments along to eligible customers in the form of monthly billing credits 
for the twelve months ended september   pge received payments totaling million and received million during each of the twelve month periods ended september  and payments for the twelve month period ending september  are expected to be approximately million  with such benefits to be credited to eligible customers 
wholesale revenues pge participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers 
in doing so  the company attempts to secure reasonably priced power  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts through economic dispatch decisions for its own generation 
interconnected transmission systems in the western united states serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power  hydro conditions  and daily and seasonal retail demand 
the majority of pge s wholesale electricity sales is to utilities and power marketers and is predominantly short term 
the company may net purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power  with only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations physically settled 
other operating revenues other operating revenues consist primarily of the sale of excess natural gas and oil  as well as revenues from transmission services  excess transmission capacity resales  pole contact rentals  and other electric services provided to customers 
seasonality demand for electricity by pge s residential customers is affected by seasonal weather conditions  as discussed above 
the company uses heating and cooling degree days to determine the effect of weather on the demand for 
table of contents electricity 
heating and cooling degree days provide cumulative variances in the average daily temperature from a baseline of degrees  over a period of time  to indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use  or have used  electricity for heating or air conditioning 
the higher the numbers of degree days  the greater the expected demand for heating or cooling 
the following table indicates the heating and cooling degree days for the most recent three year period  along with year averages for the most recent year provided by the national weather service  as measured at portland international airport heating degree days cooling degree days year average for pge s all time high net system load peak of  megawatts mw occurred in december the company s all time summer peak of  mw occurred in july the following table presents the company s average winter and summer loads for the periods indicated along with the corresponding peak load and month in which it occurred average load peak load mw month mw winter january summer september winter november summer august winter december summer july the company tracks and evaluates both base load growth and peak capacity for purposes of long term load forecasting and integrated resource planning as well as for preparing general rate case assumptions 
behavior patterns  conservation  energy efficiency initiatives and measures  weather effects  and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate capacity reserves 

table of contents power supply pge relies upon its generating resources as well as short and long term power and fuel purchase contracts to meet its customers energy requirements 
the company executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation  and participates in the wholesale market as a result of those economic dispatch decisions  in an effort to obtain reasonably priced power for its retail customers 
pge s base generating resources consist of five thermal plants  seven hydroelectric plants  and a wind farm located at biglow canyon in eastern oregon 
the volume of electricity the company generates is dependent upon  among other factors  the capacity and availability of its generating resources 
capacity of the thermal plants represents the mw the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions  net of electricity used in the operation of the plant 
the capacity of the company s thermal generating resources is also affected by ambient temperatures 
capacity of both hydro and wind generating resources represent the nameplate mw  which varies from actual energy expected to be received as these types of generating resources are highly dependent upon river flows and wind conditions  respectively 
availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations  which reflects the impact of planned and forced outages 
for a complete listing of these facilities  see item properties 
the company also promotes the expansion of renewable energy resources  as well as energy efficiency measures  to meet its energy requirements and enhance customers ability to manage their energy use more efficiently 
pge s resource capacity in mw was as follows as of december  capacity capacity capacity generation thermal natural gas coal total thermal hydro wind total generation purchased power long term contracts capacity exchange mid columbia hydro confederated tribes hydro wind other total long term contracts short term contracts total purchased power total resource capacity capacity represents nameplate and differs from expected capacity  which is expected to range from mw to mw  dependent upon wind conditions

generation that portion of pge s retail load requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors  including planned and forced outages  availability and price of coal and natural gas  precipitation and snow pack levels  the market price of electricity  and wind variability 
thermal pge has a ownership interest in boardman  which it operates  and a ownership interest in colstrip units and these two coal fired generating facilities provided approximately of the company s total retail load requirement in  compared to in and in the company s three natural gas fired generating facilities  port westward  beaver  and coyote springs  provided approximately of its total retail load requirement in and in and the thermal plants  which have a combined capacity of  mw  provide reliable power for the company s customers with plant availability  excluding colstrip  of in  in  and in and colstrip plant availability of in  in  and in hydro the company s ferc licensed hydroelectric projects consist of pelton round butte on the deschutes river near madras  oregon discussed below  four plants on the clackamas river  and one on the willamette river 
the licenses for these projects expire at various dates from to these plants  which have a combined capacity of mw  provided of the company s total retail load requirement in  and  with availability of in and in both and northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region s power supply  with water conditions significantly impacting pge s cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases 
pge has a ownership interest in the mw pelton round butte hydroelectric project on the deschutes river  with the remaining interest held by the confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation of oregon tribes 
a year joint license for the project  which is operated by pge  was issued by the ferc in the tribes have an option to purchase an additional undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion no sooner than december  the tribes have a second option to purchase an undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion no sooner than april  if both options are exercised by the tribes  the tribes ownership percentage would exceed 
wind biglow canyon wind farm biglow canyon  located in sherman county  oregon  is pge s largest renewable energy resource with wind turbines with a total installed capacity of approximately mw 
it was completed and placed in service in three phases between december and august in  biglow canyon provided of the company s total retail load requirement  compared to in and in  with availability of in and in both and the energy received from wind resources differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to range from mw to mw for biglow canyon  dependent upon wind conditions 
dispatchable standby generation dsg pge has a dsg program under which the company can start  operate  and monitor customer owned standby generators when needed to meet peak demand 
the program helps provide operating reserves for the company s generating resources and  when operating  can supply most or all of dsg customer loads 
as of december   there were projects that together can provide approximately mw of diesel fired capacity at peak times 
in addition  there were projects under construction that are expected to provide an additional mw 

table of contents fuel supply pge contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the company s thermal generating plants  with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil if needed 
in addition  the company uses forward  swap  and option contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
coal boardman pge has fixed price purchase agreements that provide coal for boardman into the coal is obtained from surface mining operations in wyoming and montana and is delivered by rail under two separate ten year transportation contracts which extend through pge expects to begin seeking requests for proposal in mid for the purchase of coal to fill open positions for and beyond 
the terms of any contracts and quality of coal are expected to be staged in alignment with the timing of the installation of required emissions controls 
for additional information on boardman s emissions controls  see the capital requirements section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of coal are available to meet anticipated operations of boardman for the foreseeable future 
natural gas port westward and beaver pge manages the price risk of natural gas supply for port westward through financial contracts up to months in advance 
physical supplies for port westward and beaver are generally purchased within months of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plants 
pge owns  and is the operator of record  of the kelso beaver pipeline  which directly connects both generating plants to the northwest pipeline  an interstate natural gas pipeline operating between british columbia and new mexico 
currently  pge transports gas on the kelso beaver pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement  with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the company 
pge has access to  dth per day of firm gas transportation capacity to serve the two plants 
pge also has contractual access through april to natural gas storage in mist  oregon  from which it can draw in the event that gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use 
this storage may be used to fuel both port westward and beaver 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available to meet anticipated operations of both plants for the foreseeable future 
the beaver generating plant has the capability to operate on no 
diesel fuel oil when it is economical or if the plant s natural gas supply is interrupted 
pge had an approximate day supply of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel oil at the plant site as of december  the current operating permit for beaver limits the number of gallons of fuel oil that can be burned daily  which effectively limits the daily hours of operation of beaver 
coyote springs pge manages the price risk of natural gas supply for coyote springs through financial contracts up to months in advance  while physical supplies are generally purchased within months of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plant 
coyote springs utilizes  dth per day of natural gas when operating at full capacity  with firm transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in alberta  canada 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available for coyote springs for the foreseeable future  based on anticipated operation of the plant 
although coyote springs was designed to also operate on fuel oil  such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations 
purchased power pge supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements 
the company utilizes short and long term wholesale power purchase contracts in an effort to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis 
such contracts have original terms ranging from one month to years and expire at varying dates through 
table of contents pge s medium term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions 
the strategy allows the company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery 
by purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period  pge mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel 
the company s major power purchase contracts consist of the following also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts capacity exchange pge has three contracts that provide pge with firm capacity to help meet the company s peak loads 
the contracts range from mw to mw and expire at various dates from february through december they include a seasonal exchange contract with another western utility that helps meet winter peaking requirements 
mid columbia hydro pge has long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington for a portion of the output of three hydroelectric projects on the mid columbia river 
these contracts expire at various dates from through although the projects currently provide a total of mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon river flows 
confederated tribes pge has a long term agreement under which the company purchases  at market prices  the tribes interest in the output of the pelton round butte hydroelectric project 
although the agreement provides mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon river flows 
the term of the agreement coincides with the term of the ferc license for this project  which expires in wind the company has three long term contracts  which extend to various dates between and  that provide for the purchase of renewable wind generated electricity 
although these contracts provide a total of mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon wind conditions 
other these primarily consist of long term contracts to purchase power from various counterparties  including other pacific northwest utilities  over terms extending into other also includes contracts that provide for the purchase of renewable solar powered electricity as follows pge operates three photovoltaic solar power projects installed in the portland area  with a combined installed capacity of mw 
pge purchases of the energy generated from two of the facilities and purchases any excess energy generated from one facility pursuant to a net metering arrangement with the oregon department of transportation odot  pge has two year purchase agreements for the power generated from two photovoltaic solar projects installed near salem  oregon 
the construction of the projects was completed in mid  with pge then purchasing the power generated from these facilities  which have a combined generating capacity of mw 
in january  pge completed the construction of a mw photovoltaic solar power project  which was sold and simultaneously leased back from a financial institution 
the company operates the project and receives of the power generated by the facility 
short term contracts these contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length 
they are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the company s load requirement 
pge also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers 
such purchases are made under contracts that range in duration from minutes to less than one month
