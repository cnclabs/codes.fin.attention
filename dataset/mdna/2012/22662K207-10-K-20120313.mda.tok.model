item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt  and reduced  or in some cases ceased  to provide funding to borrowers 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business 
as of december   we had outstanding million in principal amount of long term debt 
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on  or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness  combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments  could have other important consequences  including the following funds available for our operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures will be reduced as a result of the dedication of a portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness  we may be more highly leveraged than certain of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  certain of the borrowings under our debt agreements have floating rates of interest  which causes us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates  our degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic conditions  our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  and our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  investments  debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements may be reduced 
in addition  our revolving credit agreement and second lien credit agreement contain a number of significant covenants that place limitations on our activities and operations  including those relating to creation of liens  hedging  mergers  acquisitions  asset sales or dispositions  payments of dividends  incurrence of additional indebtedness  and certain leases and investments outside of the ordinary course of business 
our credit agreements require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests 
our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios and financial condition tests 
these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary or desirable corporate activities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could also result in a default under our credit agreements 
a default  if not cured or waived  could result in all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable 
if that should occur  we may not be able to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources for further information regarding future compliance with these covenants 
in addition  our borrowing base on our revolving credit agreement could be reduced by our lenders and limit our availability of future borrowings  or require us to pay back current borrowings in excess of the new borrowing base 
if we were required to pay back all or a portion of our debt  even if new financing were then available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
see our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
legislation has been proposed that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us federal income tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these proposed changes would include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain us production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of these or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our preferred stock or our common stock 
slower economic recovery in the us and other countries may materially adversely impact our operations results 
the us and other economies are recovering from a global financial crisis and recession which began in growth has resumed  but has been modest and at an unsteady rate 
there are likely to be significant long term effects resulting from the financial crisis and recession  including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than what was experienced in the years leading up to the crisis  and more volatility may occur before a sustainable  yet lower  growth rate is achieved 
global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources  including natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
nymex settlement prices for natural gas and crude oil prices dropped dramatically in from record levels in july while prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids have improved  and we hedged natural gas and crude oil prices on a portion of our forecasted production from proved developed producing reserves for up to two years forward  a reduction in demand for  and the resulting lower prices of  natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred net losses in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in the future 
we have incurred net losses in four of the last five fiscal years 
we cannot assure you that our current level of operating results will continue or improve 
our activities could require additional debt or equity financing 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  prices of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids  rates of production  timing of capital expenditures and drilling success 
negative changes in these variables could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
we may not be able to fully realize the value of our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  which are available to reduce our future federal taxable income and related income tax liability 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these nols to reduce future federal net income tax obligations 
future net losses could affect our ability to realize during the appropriate carryforward periods our available net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes and the value of the related deferred tax asset 
our ability to use our available net operating loss carryforwards and the amount of the related deferred tax asset ultimately realizable could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
we currently expect we will not be able to utilize nols of approximately million due to prior occurrences of an ownership change  as determined under section of the internal revenue code  as amended 
if we were to experience a further ownership change  as determined under section  our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with nols arising prior to the ownership change would be limited  possibly substantially 
an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre change nols we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the highest long term tax exempt rate during the three months prior to the date of the ownership change 
the long term tax exempt rate is a rate published each month by the internal revenue service 
the application of this limitation could prevent full utilization of our pre change nols arising prior to their expiration 
it is possible that additional issuances of our common stock within the next few years  or the sale of our common stock by our larger shareholders  could cause us to experience another ownership change  in which case any nols existing at the time of the change would be limited in the manner described above 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions or data could materially reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
the process of estimating natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many estimates  including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or estimates could materially reduce the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report 
see item business for information about our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
in order to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids prices  drilling and operating expenses  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  taxes and the availability of funds 
actual future production  natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were proved undeveloped reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves 
although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards  we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
in accordance with the requirements of the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate  held flat for the life of the properties 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves as of december  was based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december for crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes  the average west texas intermediate posted price was per barrel 
for natural gas volumes  the average henry hub spot price was per mmbtu 
the following sensitivity analyses for crude oil and natural gas do not include the volatility reducing effects of our derivative hedging instruments in place at december  if crude oil prices were per bbl lower than the price used  our pv as of december  would have decreased from million to million 
if natural gas prices were per mcf lower than the price used  our pv as of december   would have decreased from million to million 
any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of crude oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock 
pv is a non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation of our standardized measure to pv is provided under item properties proved reserves 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the discount factor 
our use of d and d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
in addition  the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures  which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are uncertain 
for example  we have over  square miles of d data in the south texas and gulf coast regions 
however  even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
they do not allow the interpreter to know if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
other geologists and petroleum professionals  when studying the same seismic data  may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and we could incur losses due to such expenditures 
as a result  our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical  and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve 
drilling for and producing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids can be unprofitable  not only from dry holes  but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations  pressures  fires  explosions and blowouts  pipe or cement failures  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials  and discharges of toxic gases  brine  well stimulation and completion fluids  or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment  loss of drilling fluid circulation  title problems  facility or equipment malfunctions  unexpected operational events  shortages of skilled personnel  shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services or of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities  compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements  natural disasters  and adverse weather conditions 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses  including personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination  clean up responsibilities  loss of wells  repairs to resume operations  and regulatory fines or penalties 
insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 
additionally  we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented 
we carry limited environmental insurance  thus  losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition strategy may subject us to greater risks 
the successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities  and other factors beyond our control 
such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy uncertain 
in connection with such an assessment  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
such a review  however  will not reveal all existing or potential problems  costs and liabilities  nor will it permit us  as the buyer  to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess their capabilities or deficiencies fully 
we may not inspect every well and  even when an inspection is undertaken  structural and environmental problems may not necessarily be observable 
we may be unable to successfully integrate the properties and assets we acquire with our existing operations 
integration of the properties and assets we acquire may be a complex  time consuming and costly process 
failure to timely and successfully integrate these assets and properties with our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and result of operations 
the difficulties of integrating these assets and properties present numerous risks  including acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows  we may need to i recruit additional personnel and we cannot be certain that any of our recruiting efforts will succeed and ii expand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those associated with the acquired properties  and failure to do so may lead to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or distract our management  and our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns 
we are also exposed to risks that are commonly associated with acquisitions of this type  such as unanticipated liabilities and costs  some of which may be material 
as a result  the anticipated benefits of acquiring assets and properties may not be fully realized  if at all 
when we acquire properties  in most cases  we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre closing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
we generally acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties  and in these situations we cannot assure you that we will identify all areas of existing or potential exposure 
in those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre closing liabilities  we cannot assure you that the seller will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations 
in addition  the competition to acquire producing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids properties is intense and many of our larger competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire producing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids properties that have economically recoverable reserves for acceptable prices 
we may incur substantial impairment of proved properties 
if management s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and or natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment write downs in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial results 
furthermore  any sustained decline in oil and or natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments related to oil and gas properties of zero  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
we cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate a significant portion of the properties in which we own an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  the operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  the timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  the operator s ability to procure drilling and completion services  the approval of other participants in drilling wells  and the operator s selection of suitable technology 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a few geographic areas  mostly within the state of texas  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in those few geographic areas 
the majority of our estimated proved reserves at december  and our production during were associated with our southeast texas  south texas and east texas properties 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention including potential regulation or limitation of the use of high pressure fracture stimulation techniques in these formations or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
if our access to sales markets is restricted  it could negatively impact our production  our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines  thereby necessitating delivery by other means  such as trucking  or requiring compression facilities 
such restrictions on our ability to sell our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids may have several adverse effects  including higher transportation costs  fewer potential purchasers thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price or  in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time  possible loss of a lease due to lack of production 
unless we replace our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flows  our ability to raise capital and the value of our common stock 
unless we conduct successful development  exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced 
producing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and results of operations  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
the value of our common stock and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production 
we may not be able to develop  exploit  find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production 
the potential lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and crude oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget 
when the prices of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids increase  or the demand for equipment and services is greater than the supply in certain areas  we typically encounter an increase in the cost of securing drilling rigs  equipment and supplies 
in addition  larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms 
if we are unable to acquire access to such resources  or can obtain access only at higher prices  our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our hedging activities could result in financial losses or reduce our income 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids  as well as interest rates  we currently  and may in the future  enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our natural gas  crude oil and or natural gas liquids production and our debt that could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses 
we utilize financial instruments to hedge commodity price exposure to declining prices on our crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids production 
we typically use a combination of puts  swaps and costless collars 
our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into hedging transactions for such period 
if the actual amount is higher than we estimate  we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended 
if the actual amount is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
as a result of these factors  our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows  and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids  and securing equipment and trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry 
our larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
we depend on our senior management team and other key personnel 
accordingly  the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business  financial condition and the results of operations and future growth 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our management team and employees 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team or of our other employees with critical skills needed to operate our business could have a negative effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations and future growth 
our ability to manage our growth  if any  will require us to continue to train  motivate and manage our employees and to attract  motivate and retain additional qualified personnel 
competition for these types of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting our operations 
our operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
for instance  we may be unable to obtain all necessary permits  approvals and certificates for proposed projects 
alternatively  we may have to incur substantial expenditures to obtain  maintain or renew authorizations to conduct existing projects 
if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or public opposition  we may suffer expensive delays  extended periods of non operation or significant loss of value in a project 
all such costs may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with much authority relating to the exploration for  and the development  production  transportation and marketing of  natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations  as interpreted and enforced  could have a material adverse effect on us 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
in december  the epa determined that emissions of ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
based on these findings  the epa adopted regulations that restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the caa including one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that requires construction and operating permit reviews of ghgs from certain large stationary sources 
the stationary source rule addresses the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the psd and title v permitting programs  pursuant to which these permitting programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards  which will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
the epa has also adopted regulations requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states including certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities  which may include certain of our operations 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of ghgs from our operations could require us to incur increased costs to reduce emissions of ghgs and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming  and thereby reduce demand for  the oil and natural gas we produce 
finally  some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events 
if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and or oil from dense subsurface rock formations 
the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions  but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel 
in addition  legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  disclosure  and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
in the event that new or more stringent federal  state  or local legal restrictions relation to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities  and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 
in addition  certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices  and a committee of the united states house of representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with initial results expected to be available by late and final results by moreover  the epa is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 
our operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety matters 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  regional  state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects of our operations  the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling  underground injection or other regulated activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations 
numerous governmental authorities  such as the epa the osha and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to joint and several  strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages 
in addition  the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling  construction  completion or water management activities  or waste control  handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
we may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance 
see item business environmental regulations 
the adoption of financial reform legislation by the united states congress in could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity prices  interest rates and other risks associated with our business 
in  the united states congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that changes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as us  that participate in that market 
the legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  of the dodd frank act was signed into law by the president on july   and requires the commodity futures trading commission  or the cftc  the sec and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
the cftc and the sec have not completed all the rulemaking the dodd frank act directs them to carry out 
the regulators have granted temporary relief from the general effective date for various requirements of the dodd frank act  and also have indicated they may phase in implementation of many of its requirements 
the cftc has proposed regulations under the dodd frank act to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets  and for swaps that are their economic equivalents 
certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits 
the cftc adopted these proposed regulations with modifications on october   but it is not possible at this time to predict when these regulations will become effective 
the cftc s proposed regulations would specify new margin requirements and clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with certain derivative activities 
it is not clear what the financial regulations will provide 
the legislation and new regulations may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of some derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral  or providing other credit support which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of some derivative contracts  reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the new legislation and new regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors 
finally  the dodd frank act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
risks related to an investment in our common stock two stockholders hold a significant number of our shares  which will limit your ability to influence corporate activities and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and those stockholders interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
of the approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding at december   approximately million shares are beneficially held by ocm gw holdings  llc oaktree holdings and million shares are beneficially held by america capital energy corporation acec 
as a result  oaktree holdings owns or controls outstanding common stock representing  in the aggregate  an approximate voting interest in us and acec owns or controls outstanding common stock representing  in the aggregate  an approximate voting interest in us 
as a result of this stock ownership  oaktree holdings and acec will possess significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and significant corporate transactions 
such ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change of control  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
oaktree holdings  acec and their respective affiliates engage  from time to time in the ordinary course of their respective businesses  in trading securities of  and investing in  energy companies 
as a result  conflicts may arise between the interests of oaktree holdings or acec  on the one hand  and the interests of our other stockholders  on the other hand 
either oaktree holdings or acec may  from time to time  compete directly or indirectly with us or prevent us from taking advantage of corporate opportunities 
either oaktree holdings or acec may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business  and as a result  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock 
the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons  including our operating and financial performance and prospects  our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry  conditions that impact demand for natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids  future announcements concerning our business  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  actions of competitors  market and industry perception of our success  or lack thereof  in pursuing our growth strategy  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  changes in government and environmental regulation  general market  economic and political conditions  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  sales of common stock by us or members of our management team  and natural disasters  terrorist attacks and acts of war 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies 
hence  the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company  and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price 
we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock  so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock 
our board of directors presently intends to retain all of our earnings for the expansion of our business  therefore  we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock 
any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  level of indebtedness  statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends  and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant 
also  the provisions of our revolving credit agreement and second lien credit agreement restrict the payment of dividends 
accordingly  you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment 
future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock 
future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities 
we may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments 
if any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of shares of our common stock  or the number or aggregate principal amount  as the case may be  of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial 
we may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
as of december   we had approximately million options to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding  of which million were vested 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect  if any  that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for  or prevent a third party from  acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions permit us to issue  without any further vote or action by the stockholders  additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series and  with respect to each such series  to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series  the voting powers if any of the shares of the series  and the preferences and relative  participating  optional  and other special rights  if any  and any qualification  limitations or restrictions of the shares of such series  require special meetings of the stockholders to be called by the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer  the president  or by resolution of a majority of the board of directors  require business at special meetings to be limited to the stated purpose or purposes of that meeting  require that stockholder action be taken at a meeting rather than by written consent  unless approved by our board of directors  require that stockholders follow certain procedures  including advance notice procedures  to bring certain matters before an annual meeting or to nominate a director for election  and permit directors to fill vacancies in our board of directors 
the foregoing factors  as well as the significant common stock ownership by oaktree holdings and acec  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control 
we are subject to the delaware business combination law 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
section defines a business combination as a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholders 
section defines an interested stockholder as a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or  in some cases  within three years prior  did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
under section  a business combination between us and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholders becoming an interested stockholder prior to the date the person attained the status  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced  excluding  for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding  shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and issued employee stock plans  under which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer  or the business combination is approved by our board of directors on or subsequent to the date the person became an interested stockholder and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder 
this provision has an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors  including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock 
with approval of our stockholders  we could amend our certificate of incorporation in the future to elect not to be governed by the anti takeover law 
we have the authority to issue blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder action in one or more series and to designate the dividend rate  voting rights and other rights preferences and restrictions 
the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on holders of common stock 
preferred stock is senior to common stock 
additionally  preferred stock could be issued with dividend rights senior to the rights of holders of common stock 
finally  preferred stock could be issued as part of a poison pill  which could have the effect of deterring offers to acquire our company 
the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights  preemptive rights or rights to convert their common stock to other securities 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock  par value per share 
as of december   there were approximately million and million shares of common stock issued and outstanding  respectively 
since the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights  the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present  in person or by proxy  will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors 
the holders of shares of our common stock do not have preemptive rights or rights to convert their common stock into other securities

proved reserves estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue as of december    and were prepared by nsai in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the sec 
the scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a report which is included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
the technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates are independent petroleum engineers and geoscientists that meet the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity  and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
the estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue are reviewed by our corporate reservoir engineering department that is independent of the operating departments 
the corporate reservoir engineering department interacts with geoscience  operating  accounting and marketing departments to review the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of the data  methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates 
all relevant data is compiled in a computer database application to which only authorized personnel are given access rights 
our senior vice president engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for reviewing any reserves estimates prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm 
our senior vice president engineering has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering from the university of texas and over years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility 
he reports directly to our president and chief executive officer 
reserves are also reviewed internally with senior management and presented to our board of directors in summary form on a quarterly basis 
the following tables reflect our estimated proved reserves at december for each of the preceding three years

prices for natural gas liquids in the table represent average prices for natural gas liquids used in the proved reserve estimates  calculated in accordance with applicable sec rules 
all prices  under both sets of rules  are adjusted for quality  energy content  transportation fees and regional price differentials in determining proved reserves 
average production cost includes oil and gas operating and workover expense and excludes ad valorem and severance taxes 
pv pv at year end is a non gaap financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved natural gas and crude oil reserves  less future development and productions costs  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using pricing assumptions in effect at the end of the period 
pv differs from standardized measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes or non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses and debt service or depreciation  depletion and amortization on future net revenues 
neither pv nor standardized measure represents an estimate of fair market value of our natural gas and crude oil properties 
pv is used by the industry and by our management as an arbitrary reserve asset value measure to compare against past reserve bases and the reserve bases of other business entities that are not dependent on the taxpaying status of the entity 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure to pv december  in millions standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows present value of future income taxes discounted at pv the following table reflects our estimated proved reserves by category as of december  natural gas mmcf crude oil mbbl natural gas liquids mbbl total mmcfe of total proved pv in millions proved developed producing proved developed non producing proved undeveloped total our estimated net proved reserves as of december   were approximately natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil and condensate 
our average proved reserves to production ratio  or average reserve life  is approximately years based on our proved reserves as of december  and production for the twelve months ended december  during  gross net operated and non operated wells were drilled  of which were successful 
we abandoned one well without reaching full depth due to mechanical failure and did not conclude if hydrocarbons were in place 
in  we currently expect to drill gross net wells  of which were in progress as of december  proved developed reserves total proved developed reserves decreased from bcfe at december  to bcfe at december  the change in proved developed reserves was attributable to bcfe of new natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves added from drilling  offset by bcfe in negative performance revisions and bcfe related to production 
proved undeveloped reserves from december  to december   total proved undeveloped reserves increased from bcfe to bcfe 
the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was attributable to bcfe from drilling  offset in part by a bcfe reduction in proved undeveloped reserves that we do not plan to develop within five years  bcfe in negative performance revisions on related developed reserves and bcfe in negative price revisions 
the bcfe reduction in proved undeveloped reserves due to the five year rule relate primarily to conventional natural gas reserves in south texas that we do not plan to drill within five years  because of the current low natural gas price environment and outlook and our strategic change in focus to oil weighted resource plays 
all of our current proved undeveloped locations represented in our year end reserve report are scheduled to be drilled within five years 
development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves are projected to be million for the next five years 
our financial resources are expected to be sufficient to drill all of the remaining bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves within the five year period and we are currently committed to doing so

item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our properties or operations or from disputes with vendors in the normal course of business  including the matters discussed below 
mineral interest owners in east texas haynesville shale filed two causes of action against us on may  and august   respectively  in the district court for san augustine county  texas alleging breach of contract for not paying lease bonuses on certain prospective oil and gas leases that were pursued by our leasing agent but never taken by crimson 
the damages alleged are currently approximately million and we have received approximately million in written demands from other mineral interest owners in this area that we believe may contemplate legal proceedings 
we are vigorously defending these lawsuits  and believe we have meritorious defenses 
we do not believe that these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although we cannot guarantee that a material adverse effect will not occur 
the holders of oil and gas leases in south louisiana filed suit against crimson and several co defendants alleging failure to act as a reasonably prudent operator  failure to explore  waste  breach of contract  etc 
in connection with two wells in jefferson davis parish  louisiana 
many of the alleged improprieties occurred prior to our ownership of an interest in the wells at issue  although we may have assumed liability otherwise attributable to our predecessors in interest through the acquisition documents relating to the acquisition of our interest in these wells 
the damages currently alleged are approximately million 
we and our co defendants are vigorously defending this lawsuit and we believe that we have meritorious defenses 
we do not believe this suit will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although we cannot guarantee that a material adverse effect will not occur 
in november  we and several predecessor operators were named in a lawsuit filed by an entity alleging that it owns a working interest in a productive formation that has not been recognized by us or by predecessor operators to which we have granted indemnification rights 
in dispute is whether ownership rights in specific depths were transferred through a number of decade old poorly documented transactions 
the maximum amount asserted in the suit filed could be determined at up to approximately million 
we are vigorously defending this lawsuit and believe we have meritorious defenses 
we currently do not believe that this claim will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although we cannot guarantee that a material adverse effect will not occur 
while many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty and we are unable at the date of this report to estimate an amount of possible loss with respect to these matters  we believe that the amount of the liability  if any  ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity  capital resources or future annual results of operations

on december   all outstanding shares  and accumulated dividends  of preferred stock that had not previously converted were converted into common stock in conjunction with our public offering of common stock 
share based compensation on february   we completed an option exchange program the exchange program pursuant to which we exchanged outstanding employee stock options previously granted under our stock incentive plan with an exercise price greater than per share  vested and unvested the eligible options  for new  unvested options to purchase common stock the new options 
the exchange program was effected with certain employees  including each of our named executive officers 
under the exchange program  a total of  eligible options with a weighted average exercise price of per share were exchanged for  new options with an exercise price of per share 
under the terms of the exchange program  new options which will have an exercise price per share equal to the greater of per share and the closing price per share of crimson common stock on the nasdaq global market on the last business day of the exchange offer 
therefore  since the closing price of the common stock on february  was  the exercise price per share of the new options was fixed at per share 
the fair value of the eligible options exchanged  calculated using the black scholes valuation model  was million immediately prior to the exchange and the fair value of the new options was calculated at million 
therefore  the million incremental value of the new options over the eligible options and the million of unrecognized compensation expense for the original award  or million  will be amortized on a straight line basis  over the four year vesting period of the new options  or approximately  per month 
the second amendment to the amended and restated stock incentive plan  approved by shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting on may   increased the annual limitation on option share grants to  shares thereby allowing the balance of mr

overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploitation  exploration and development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
we have historically focused our operations in the onshore us gulf coast  south texas and colorado regions  which are generally characterized by high rates of return in known  prolific producing trends 
we have expanded our strategic focus to include longer reserve life resource plays in east texas and south texas that we believe provide significant long term growth potential in multiple formations 
we are also focusing on further developing our oil liquid weighted assets 
we intend to grow reserves and production by developing our existing producing property base  pursuing out southeast texas woodbine horizontal oil redevelopment  developing our east texas and south texas resource potential  and pursuing opportunistic acquisitions in areas where we have specific operating expertise 
we have developed a significant project inventory associated with our existing property base

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate such estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of the more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
please read the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
successful efforts method we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves  delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs are expensed except those costs used to determine a drill site location 
revenue recognition we follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids revenues 
under this method  we recognize revenues on production as it is taken and delivered to its purchasers 
the volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes we are entitled to based on our ownership interest in the property 
these differences result in a condition known in the industry as a production imbalance 
our crude oil and natural gas imbalances are not significant 
depreciation  depletion and amortization the estimates of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves utilized in the calculation of depletion and depreciation are estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the society of petroleum engineers  the sec and the financial accounting standards board  which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except by contractual arrangements 
we emphasize that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise 
accordingly  the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available 
our policy is to amortize capitalized natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids costs on the unit of production method  based upon these reserve estimates 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of future cash inflows  future gross revenues  the amount of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves  the remaining estimated lives of the oil and gas properties  or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced in the near term 
if reduced  the carrying amount of capitalized oil and gas properties may be reduced materially in the near term 
impairment of oil and gas properties we assess our proved properties for possible impairment on an annual basis as a minimum  or as circumstances warrant  based on geological trend analysis  decreases in commodity prices  changes in proved reserves or relinquishment of acreage 
proved natural gas and crude oil properties are reviewed for impairment on a field basis when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such property 
impairments  measured using fair market value  are recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable and the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimated fair values are determined using discounted cash flow models or expected cash flow technique 
the discounted cash flow and expected cash flow models include management s estimates of future oil and gas production  commodity prices based on forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate  operating and development costs  discount rates and recent transactions of similar assets between market participants 
when impairment occurs  the adjustment is recorded to accumulated depletion 
see the discussion of impairment expenses in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the costs of unproved leaseholds  including associated interest costs for the period activities that were in progress to bring projects to their intended use  are capitalized pending the results of exploration efforts 
we regularly assess on a property by property basis the impairment of individual unproved properties whose acquisition costs are relatively significant 
unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not relatively significant are amortized in the aggregate over the lesser of three years or the average remaining lease term 
as exploration work progresses and the reserves on significant properties are proven  capitalized costs of these properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration work is unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to the unsuccessful work will be charged to exploration expense 
the timing of any write downs of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
asset retirement obligations we recognize an estimated liability for the plugging and abandonment of our natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids wells and associated pipelines and equipment 
the liability and the associated increase in the related long lived asset are recorded in the period in which our asset retirement obligation  or aro  is incurred 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the estimated liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells  estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the liability is discounted using an assumed credit adjusted risk free rate 
revisions to the liability could occur due to acquisitions and dispositions  changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  changes in the risk free rate or remaining lives of the wells  or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements 
at the time of abandonment  we recognize a gain or loss on abandonment to the extent that actual costs do not equal the estimated costs 
derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period we record on our balance sheet the mark to market valuation of our derivative instruments 
the estimated change in fair value of the derivatives is reported in other income and expense as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  an income tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of the valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income and changes in stockholder ownership that limit the use of net operating losses under the internal revenue code section our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and net operating and capital loss carryforwards and carrybacks 
adjustments related to differences between the estimates we used and actual amounts we reported are recorded in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with our net tax operating losses 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
we expect we will not be able to utilize certain deferred tax assets due to the limitations of internal revenue code section and we have recognized a valuation allowance for that limitation 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods 
any adjustments or changes in our estimates of asset recovery could have an impact on our results of operations
