item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business strategy also stresses the importance of customer deposit relationships to support its lending activities 
our guiding principle is to serve our market areas by operating with a customer first service philosophy  affording our customers the highest priority in all aspects of our operations 
we believe that our successful execution of this philosophy has created a very strong core deposit franchise that provides a stable  low cost funding source for expanded growth in all of our lending areas 
we have devoted significant resources to future deposit product development  expansion of electronic services for both personal and business customers  and enhancement of information security related to these services 
the company s geographical expansion has historically been limited to the anchorage  fairbanks and matanuska susitna valley regions of alaska and  to a lesser extent  the washington and oregon areas through the operations of nfs 
while the company continues to consider potential expansion of its branch network in these locations  additional geographic regions will be considered if appropriate opportunities are presented 
in addition to market share growth  a significant aspect of the company s business strategy is focused on managing the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
over the last five years  the company has allocated substantial resources to the credit management function of the bank to provide enhanced financial analysis of our largest  most complex loan relationships to further develop our processes for analyzing and managing various concentrations of credit within the overall loan portfolio  and to develop strategies to improve or collect our existing loans 
as a result of these efforts  the company s ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets has decreased to at december  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
improvements in the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio have had a direct and positive impact on net income through a reduction of loan and other real estate owned oreo related costs  as well as decreased fdic insurance costs 
continued success in maintaining or further improving the credit quality of our loan portfolio is a significant aspect of the company s strategy for attaining sustainable  long term market share growth to affect increased shareholder value 

table of contents employees we believe that we provide a high level of customer service 
to achieve our objective of providing customer first service  management emphasizes the hiring and retention of competent and highly motivated employees at all levels of the organization 
management believes that a well trained and highly motivated core of employees allows maximum personal contact with customers in order to understand and fulfill customer needs and preferences 
this customer first service philosophy is combined with our emphasis on personalized  local decision making 
in keeping with this philosophy and with our strategy to increase our market share  the company hired several new loan officers in who have valuable expertise in our niche markets 
we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we had full time equivalent employees at december  none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
products and services lending services we have an emphasis on commercial and real estate lending 
we also believe we have a significant niche in construction and land development lending in anchorage  fairbanks  and the matanuska susitna valley 
see loans in item of this report 
asset based lending we provide short term working capital to customers in the states of washington and oregon by purchasing their accounts receivable through nfs  a division of the bank 
in  we expect nfs to continue to penetrate these markets and to continue to contribute to the company s net income 
deposit services our deposit services include noninterest bearing checking accounts and interest bearing time deposits  checking accounts  and savings accounts 
our interest bearing accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
we have two deposit products that are indexed to specific us treasury rates 
several of our deposit services and products are an indexed money market deposit account  a jump up certificate of deposit cd that allows additional deposits with the opportunity to increase the rate to the current market rate for a similar term cd  an indexed cd that allows additional deposits  quarterly withdrawals without penalty  and tailored maturity dates  and arrangements to courier noncash deposits from our customers to their local northrim bank branch 
other services in addition to our deposit and lending services  we offer our customers several hour services consumer online banking  mobile web and text banking  business online banking  financeworks powered by quicken  online statements  visa check cards  business visa check cards  cash back rewards  telebanking  faxed account statements  and automated teller services

other services provided through affiliates the company provides residential mortgages throughout alaska  and to a lesser extent in the state of washington via the company s ownership interest in rml 
we also sell and service employee benefit plans for small and medium sized businesses in alaska through nbg  an insurance brokerage company 
the company also offers annuity and other insurance products through ecia  an insurance agency  and long term investment portfolios through eccm  an investment advisory services company 
as of march   there are four northrim bank employees who are licensed as investment advisor representatives and are actively selling the elliott cove investment products 
finally  our affiliate pwa provides investment advisory  trust  and wealth management services for customers who are primarily located in the pacific northwest and alaska 
we plan to continue to leverage our affiliate relationships to strengthen our existing customer base and bring new customers into the bank 
significant business concentrations no individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to our total assets or total revenues  or to the total assets  deposits or revenues of the bank  or in relation to our overall business 
however  approximately of our loan portfolio at december  is attributable to sixteen large borrowing relationships 
moreover  our business activities are currently focused primarily in the state of alaska 
consequently  our results of 
table of contents operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in the alaska economy and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets in anchorage  fairbanks  and the matanuska susitna valley 
alaska economy our growth and operations depend upon the economic conditions of alaska and the specific markets we serve 
alaska is strategically located on the pacific rim  within nine hours by air from of the industrialized world  and anchorage has become a worldwide cargo and transportation link between the united states and international business in asia and europe 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resources industries 
key sectors of the alaska economy are the oil industry  government and military spending  and the construction  fishing  forest products  tourism  mining  air cargo  and transportation industries  as well as medical services 
the petroleum industry plays a significant role in the economy of alaska 
according to the state of alaska department of revenue  approximately of the unrestricted revenues that fund the alaska state government are generated through various taxes and royalties on the oil industry 
any significant changes in the alaska economy and the markets we serve eventually could have a positive or negative impact on the company 
state revenues are sensitive to volatile oil prices and production levels have been in decline for years  however  high oil prices have been sustained for several years now  despite the global recession 
this has allowed the alaska state government to continue to increase operating and capital budgets and add to its reserves 
the long run growth of the alaska economy will most likely be determined by large scale natural resource development projects 
several multi billion dollar projects are progressing or can potentially advance in the near term 
some of these projects include a large diameter natural gas pipeline  related gas exploration at point thomson by exxon and partners  exploration for new wells offshore in the outer continental shelf by shell and conoco phillips  potential oil and gas activities in the arctic national wildlife refuge  copper  gold and molybdenum production at the pebble and donlon creek mines  and energy development in the national petroleum reserve alaska 
because of their size  each of these projects faces tremendous challenges 
contentious political decisions need to be made by government regulators  issues need to be resolved in the court system  and multi billion dollar financial commitments need to be made by the private sector if they are to advance 
if none of these projects moves forward in the next ten years  then state revenues will decline with falling oil production from older fields on the north slope of alaska 
the decline in state revenues will likely have a negative effect on alaska s economy 
tourism is another major employment sector of the alaska economy 
in  according to the state of alaska s department of commerce  revenue collected from bed taxes in anchorage increased in the twelve month period ended june  to million from million in the twelve month period ended june  additionally  the department of commerce reported a increase in people visiting the state of alaska in the fall and winter seasons the period between october and april as compared to the prior year 
alaska has weathered the great recession better than many other states in the nation  due largely to a natural resources based economy which continues to benefit from high commodities and energy prices 
according to the legislative finance division of the state of alaska  as of september   alaska has more than billion in liquid reserves 
as of december  the permanent fund has a balance of billion  which pays an annual dividend to every alaskan citizen 
in  unemployment in alaska decreased to according to the alaska department of labor as compared to for the united states 
this marks the th consecutive month that alaska s unemployment rate has been lower than the national average 
a material portion of our loans at december   were secured by real estate located in greater anchorage  matanuska susitna valley  and fairbanks  alaska 
moreover  of our revenue was derived from the residential housing market in the form of loan fees and interest on residential construction and land development loans and income from rml  our mortgage real estate affiliate 
real estate values generally are affected by economic and other conditions in the area where the real estate is located  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in tax and other laws  and other matters outside of our control 
since  the anchorage area and fairbanks real estate markets have experienced a significant slowdown 
any further decline in real estate values in the greater anchorage  matanuska susitna valley  and fairbanks areas could significantly reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing our real estate loans and could increase the likelihood of defaults under these loans 
in addition  at december   million  or  of our loan portfolio was represented by commercial loans in alaska 
commercial loans generally have greater risk than real estate loans 
alaska s residents are not subject to any state income or state sales taxes 
for the past years  alaska residents have received annual distributions payable in october of each year from the alaska permanent fund corporation  which is supported by royalties from oil production 
the distribution was  per eligible resident in for an aggregate distribution of approximately million 
the anchorage economic development corporation estimates that  for most anchorage households  distributions from the alaska permanent fund exceed other alaska taxes to which those households are subject primarily real estate taxes 

table of contents competition we operate in a highly competitive and concentrated banking environment 
we compete not only with other commercial banks  but also with many other financial competitors  including credit unions including alaska usa federal credit union  one of the nation s largest credit unions  finance companies  mortgage banks and brokers  securities firms  insurance companies  private lenders  and other financial intermediaries  many of which have a state wide or regional presence  and in some cases  a national presence 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and capital than we do and offer products and services that are not offered by us 
our non bank competitors also generally operate under fewer regulatory constraints  and in the case of credit unions  are not subject to income taxes 
according to information published by the state of alaska department of commerce  credit unions in alaska have a share of total statewide deposits held in banks and credit unions as of december  recent changes in credit union regulations have eliminated the common bond of membership requirement and liberalized their lending authority to include business and real estate loans on a par with commercial banks 
the differences in resources and regulation may make it harder for us to compete profitably  to reduce the rates that we can earn on loans and investments  to increase the rates we must offer on deposits and other funds  and adversely affect our financial condition and earnings 
as our industry becomes increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technology driven delivery systems  permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone  computer and the internet  non bank institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area 
some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than may be appropriate for the company in relation to its asset and liability management objectives 
however  we offer a wide array of deposit products and services and believe we can compete effectively through relationship based pricing and effective delivery of customer first service 
we also compete with full service investment firms for non bank financial products and services offered by eccm  ecia and pwa 
in the late s  eight of the thirteen commercial banks and savings and loan associations in alaska failed  resulting in the largest commercial banks gaining significant market share 
currently  there are eight commercial banks operating in alaska 
at june   the date of the most recently available information  we had approximately a share of the alaska commercial bank deposits  in the anchorage area  and in fairbanks 
the following table sets forth market share data for the commercial banks having a presence in the greater anchorage area as of june   the most recent date for which comparative deposit information is available 
financial institution number of branches total deposits market share of deposits dollars in thousands northrim bank wells fargo bank alaska first national bank alaska key bank total supervision and regulation the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of the bhc act registered with and subject to examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb 
the company s bank subsidiary is an alaska state chartered commercial bank and is subject to examination  supervision  and regulation by the alaska department of commerce  community and economic development  division of banking  securities and corporations the division 
the fdic insures northrim bank s deposits and in that capacity also regulates northrim bank 
the company s affiliated investment companies  eccm and ecia  and its affiliated investment advisory and wealth management company  pacific portfolio consulting llc  are subject to and regulated under the investment advisors act of and applicable state investment advisor rules and regulations 
the company s affiliated trust company  pacific portfolio trust company  is regulated as a non depository trust company under the banking laws of the state of washington 
the company s earnings and activities are affected by legislation  by actions of the frb  the division  the fdic and other regulators  and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts 
for example  these include limitations on the ability of northrim bank to pay dividends to the company  numerous federal and state consumer protection laws imposing requirements on the making  enforcement  and collection of consumer loans  and restrictions on and regulation of the sale of mutual funds and other uninsured investment products to customers 

table of contents congress enacted major federal financial institution legislation in title i of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act  which became effective march   allows bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies 
in addition to the activities previously permitted bank holding companies  financial holding companies may engage in non banking activities that are financial in nature  such as securities  insurance  and merchant banking activities  subject to certain limitations 
the company may utilize the new structure to accommodate an expansion of its products and services 
the activities of bank holding companies  such as the company  that are not financial holding companies  are generally limited to managing or controlling banks 
a bank holding company is required to obtain the prior approval of the frb for the acquisition of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company 
nonbank activities of a bank holding company are also generally limited to the acquisition of up to of the voting shares of a company and activities previously determined by the frb by regulation or order to be closely related to banking  unless prior approval is obtained from the frb 
the glb act also included the most extensive consumer privacy provisions ever enacted by congress 
these provisions  among other things  require full disclosure of the company s privacy policy to consumers and mandate offering the consumer the ability to opt out of having non public personal information disclosed to third parties 
pursuant to these provisions  the federal banking regulators have adopted privacy regulations 
in addition  the states are permitted to adopt more extensive privacy protections through legislation or regulation 
there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from banking subsidiaries or engage in certain other transactions with or involving those banking subsidiaries 
with certain exceptions  federal law imposes limitations on  and requires collateral for  extensions of credit by insured depository institutions  such as northrim bank  to their non bank affiliates  such as the company 
subject to certain limitations and restrictions  a bank holding company  with prior approval of the frb  may acquire an out of state bank 
banks in states that do not prohibit out of state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency 
a state bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is expressly permitted by the other state 
among other things  applicable federal and state statutes and regulations which govern a bank s activities relate to minimum capital requirements  required reserves against deposits  investments  loans  legal lending limits  mergers and consolidations  borrowings  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  establishment of branches and other aspects of its operations 
the division and the fdic also have authority to prohibit banks under their supervision from engaging in what they consider to be unsafe and unsound practices 
specifically with regard to the payment of dividends  there are certain limitations on the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders 
it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines a bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions also limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
additionally  depending upon the circumstances  the fdic or the division could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
under longstanding frb policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks 
the company could be required to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in circumstances where it might not do so  absent such policy 
the company and northrim bank are subject to risk based capital and leverage guidelines issued by federal banking agencies for banks and bank holding companies 
these agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards and have defined five capital tiers  the highest of which is well capitalized 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and northrim bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
federal banking agencies have established minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier i capital to average assets 
the regulations set forth the definitions of capital  risk weighted and average assets 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the 
table of contents regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
management believes  as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all capital adequacy requirements for a well capitalized institution 
under the regulations adopted by the federal regulatory authorities  a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  and v critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to  or deemed to be in  a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
banks that are downgraded from well capitalized to adequately capitalized face significant additional restrictions 
for example  an adequately capitalized status affects a bank s ability to accept brokered deposits and enter into reciprocal certificate of deposit account registry system cdars contracts without the prior approval of the fdic  and may cause greater difficulty obtaining retail deposits 
cdars is a network of over  banks throughout the united states 
the cdars system was founded in and allows participating banks to exchange fdic insurance coverage so that of the balance of their customers certificates of deposit are fully subject to fdic insurance 
the system also allows for investment of banks own investment dollars in the form of domestic certificates of deposit 
banks in the adequately capitalized classification may have to pay higher interest rates to continue to attract those deposits  and higher deposit insurance rates for those deposits 
this status also affects a bank s eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals 
management intends to maintain a tier risk based capital ratio for the bank in excess of in  exceeding the fdic s well capitalized capital requirement classification 
the dividends that the bank pays to the company are limited to the extent necessary for the bank to meet the regulatory requirements of a well capitalized bank 
the capital ratios for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offerings that the company completed in the second quarter of and in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes  although they are accounted for as a liability in its consolidated financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital although the company did contribute to the bank a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of those securities 
as a result  the company has million more in regulatory capital than the bank at december  and  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities 
northrim bank is required to file periodic reports with the fdic and the division and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities 
these examinations must be conducted every months  except that certain well capitalized banks may be examined every months 
the fdic and the division may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination 
in the liquidation or other resolution of a failed insured depository institution  deposits in offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims  including non deposit claims  and claims of a parent company such as the company 
such priority creditors would include the fdic  which succeeds to the position of insured depositors 
the company is also subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the securities exchange act of  including certain requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of the bank is subject to the community reinvestment act of cra 
the cra requires that the bank help meet the credit needs of the communities it serves  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution 
the fdic assigns one of four possible ratings to the bank s cra performance and makes the rating and the examination reports publicly available 
the four possible ratings are outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve and substantial noncompliance 
a financial institution s cra rating can affect an institution s future business 
for example  a federal banking agency will take cra performance into consideration when acting on an institution s application to establish or move a branch  to merge or to acquire assets or assume liabilities of another institution 
in its most recent cra examination  northrim bank received a satisfactory rating from the fdic 
the company is also subject to the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the usa patriot act 
among other things  the usa patriot act requires financial institutions  such as the company and northrim bank  to adopt and implement specific policies and procedures designed 
table of contents to prevent and defeat money laundering 
management believes the company is in compliance with the usa patriot act as in effect on december  on october   the us congress passed  and the president signed into law  the emergency economic stabilization act of the stabilization act 
among other things  the stabilization act temporarily increased the amount of insurance coverage of deposit accounts held at fdic insured depository institutions  including the bank  from  to  this coverage was permanently increased effective in july on october   using the systemic risk exception to the fdic improvement act of  the us treasury authorized the fdic to provide a guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt and deposits in non interest bearing transaction accounts at fdic insured institutions 
the company elected to participate in this program as it pertains to the guarantee of non interest bearing transaction accounts by the fdic 
banks participating in the transaction account guarantee program are required to pay an additional basis points in insurance fees on the amounts guaranteed by the program 
this transaction account guarantee program is scheduled to expire on january  the company elected not to participate in the part of the program that guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt 
under the troubled asset auction program  another initiative based on the authority granted by the stabilization act  the us treasury  through a newly created office of financial stability  has purchased certain troubled mortgage related assets from financial institutions in a reverse auction format 
troubled assets eligible for purchase by the office of financial stability include residential and commercial mortgages originated on or before march   securities or obligations that are based on such mortgages  and any other financial instrument that the secretary of the us treasury determines  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  is necessary to promote financial market stability 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed into law which  among other things  limits the ability of certain bank holding companies to treat trust preferred security debt issuances as tier capital 
this law may require many banks to raise new tier capital and will effectively close the trust preferred securities markets from offering new issuances in the future 
since the company had less than billion in assets at december   under the dodd frank act  the company will be able to continue to include its existing trust preferred securities in tier capital

risk factors an investment in the company s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the company s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the company are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of the company s common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and changes of or increases in banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
in addition  as a publicly traded company  we are subject to regulation by the securities and exchange commission 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement  income tax laws and accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations 
changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations 
additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to appropriately 
table of contents comply with any such laws  regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  or damage to our reputation  all of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that regard  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was enacted in july among other provisions  the new legislation creates a new bureau of consumer financial protection with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages  creates a financial stability oversight council comprised of the heads of other regulatory agencies  will lead to new capital requirements from federal banking agencies  places new limits on electronic debt card interchange fees  and will require the securities and exchange commission and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms 
the new legislation and regulations are expected to increase the overall costs of regulatory compliance and limit certain sources of revenue 
further  regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy practices that they deem to be unsafe or unsound  or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
recently  these powers have been utilized more frequently due to the serious national economic conditions we are facing 
the exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the us federal government and its agencies  including the federal reserve board 
we cannot accurately predict the full effects of recent legislation or the various other governmental  regulatory  monetary  and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets and on the company 
the terms and costs of these activities  or the failure of these actions to help stabilize the financial markets  asset prices  market liquidity  and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and the trading price of our common stock 
we may be adversely impacted by recent volatility in the european financial markets in  a financial crisis emerged in europe  triggered by high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain  which created concerns about the ability of these eu peripheral nations to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations 
these conditions impacted financial markets and resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of many eu nations 
certain european nations continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress  and yields on government issued bonds in greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain have risen and remain volatile 
despite assistance packages to greece  ireland and portugal  the creation of a joint eu imf european financial stability facility in may  and a recently announced plan to expand financial assistance to greece  uncertainty over the outcome of the eu governments financial support programs and worries about sovereign finances persist 
market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of european banks and insurers to the eu peripheral nations has resulted in a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some european financial institutions 
risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery  sovereign and non sovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions 
market and economic disruptions have affected  and may continue to affect  consumer confidence levels and spending  personal bankruptcy rates  levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices  among other factors 
there can be no assurance that the market disruptions in europe  including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions  will not spread  nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or  even if provided  will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in europe or elsewhere 
while we have no direct exposure to european financial institutions or sovereign debt  to the extent uncertainty regarding the economic recovery continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors  our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by the unprecedented volatility in the financial markets 
dramatic declines in the national housing market in and  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility  and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
our financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate 
similarly  declining real estate values can adversely 
table of contents impact the carrying value of real estate secured loans 
the downturn in the economy  the slowdown in the real estate market  and declines in some real estate values had a direct and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in and while we experienced some stabilization in the economy in and  we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve significantly in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we expect to face continued increased regulation of our industry  including as a result of the stabilization act and dodd frank legislation 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we have been required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
the operations of our business  including our interaction with customers  are increasingly done via electronic means  and this has increased our risks related to cybersecurity 
the company is exposed to cyber attacks in the normal course of business 
in general  cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events 
we have observed an increased level of attention focused on cyber attacks that include  but are not limited to  gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information  corrupting data  or causing operational disruption 
cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access  such as by causing denial of service attacks on websites 
cyber attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access 
the objectives of cyber attacks vary widely and may include theft of financial assets  intellectual property  or other sensitive information belonging to the company or our customers 
cyber attacks may also be directed at disrupting the operations of the company s business 
while the company has not incurred any material losses related to cyber attacks  nor are we aware of any specific or threatened cyber incidents as of the date of this report  we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber attacks 
such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused  increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes  deploying additional personnel and protection technologies  training employees  and engaging third party experts and consultants  lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack  litigation  and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence 
declines in the residential housing market would have a negative impact on our residential housing market income 
the company earns revenue from the residential housing market in the form of interest income and fees on loans and earnings from rml 
a slowdown in the residential sales cycle in our major markets and a constriction in the availability of mortgage financing have negatively impacted real estate sales  which has resulted in customers inability to repay loans 
in  the company expects that its revenues from the residential housing market in the form of interest income and fees on loans and earnings from rml will be higher than because of an increase in residential construction loans through the company s efforts to increase market share in this area  offset in part by a decline in refinance activity at rml 
however  further declines in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition through a decline in interest income and fees 
our loan loss allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses  which may adversely affect our earnings 
we have established a reserve for probable losses we expect to incur in connection with loans in our credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects our estimate of the collectability of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding 
our determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is highly subjective  although management personnel apply criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  we cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if our loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  we may suffer unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan loss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that the allowance is inadequate  they may require us to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact our net income and financial condition 

table of contents we have a significant concentration in real estate lending 
the sustained downturn in real estate within our markets has had and is expected to continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  consisted of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate located in alaska 
in recent years the slowdown in the residential sales cycle in our major markets and a constriction in the availability of mortgage financing have negatively impacted residential real estate sales  which has resulted in customers inability to repay loans 
during  we experienced a significant increase in non performing assets relating to our real estate lending  primarily in our residential real estate portfolio 
although non performing assets decreased from december  to december   we will see a further increase in non performing assets if more borrowers fail to perform according to loan terms and if we take possession of real estate properties 
additionally  if real estate values decline  the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced 
if any of these effects continue or become more pronounced  loan losses will increase more than we expect and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
further  approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  consisted of commercial real estate loans 
nationally  delinquencies in these types of portfolios have increased significantly in recent years 
while our investments in these types of loans have not been as adversely impacted as residential construction and land development loans  there can be no assurance that the credit quality in these portfolios will remain stable 
commercial construction and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a consumer loan 
these trends may continue and may result in losses that exceed the estimates that are currently included in our loan loss allowance  which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations 
real estate values may continue to decrease leading to additional and greater than anticipated loan charge offs and valuation write downs on our other real estate owned oreo properties 
real estate owned by the bank and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as other real estate owned or oreo property 
we foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for defaulted loans as part of our business 
at december   the bank held million of oreo properties  many of which relate to residential construction and land development loans 
increased oreo balances lead to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties 
our ability to sell oreo properties is affected by public perception that banks are inclined to accept large discounts from market value in order to quickly liquidate properties 
any decrease in market prices may lead to oreo write downs  with a corresponding expense in our income statement 
we evaluate oreo property values periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluations require it 
further write downs on oreo or an inability to sell oreo properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates could adversely impact the company 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as the net interest margin 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the repricing frequency of our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although we believe the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our financial performance depends on our ability to manage recent and possible future growth 
our financial performance and profitability will depend on our ability to manage recent and possible future growth 
although we believe that we have substantially integrated the business and operations of past acquisitions  there can be no assurance that unforeseen issues relating to the acquisitions will not adversely affect us 
any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have experienced in the past 

table of contents our concentration of operations in the anchorage  matanuska susitna valley  and fairbanks  areas of alaska makes us more sensitive to downturns in those areas 
substantially all of our business is derived from the anchorage  matanuska susitna valley  and fairbanks  areas of alaska 
the majority of our lending has been with alaska businesses and individuals 
at december   approximately of the bank s loans are secured by real estate and are for general commercial uses  including professional  retail  and small businesses  respectively 
substantially all of these loans are collateralized and repayment is expected from the borrowers cash flow or  secondarily  the collateral 
our exposure to credit loss  if any  is the outstanding amount of the loan if the collateral is proved to be of no value 
these areas rely primarily upon the natural resources industries  particularly oil production  as well as tourism  government and us military spending for their economic success 
our business is and will remain sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in regions served by the company  may have a more pronounced effect upon its business than they might on an institution that is less geographically concentrated 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon our results of operation and financial condition 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through northrim bank  our banking subsidiary  our ability to pay dividends  repurchase our shares or to repay our indebtedness depends upon liquid assets held by the holding company and the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
the company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries and it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid from the bank 
there are legal limitations on the extent to which the bank may extend credit  pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to  or engage in transactions with  us 
our inability to receive dividends from the bank could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
our net income depends primarily upon the bank s net interest income  which is the income that remains after deducting from total income generated by earning assets the expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets primarily interest paid on deposits 
the amount of interest income is dependent on many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of changes in interest rates and the levels of nonperforming loans 
all of those factors affect the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
the bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
it is also possible that  depending upon the financial condition of the bank and other factors  regulatory authorities could conclude that payment of dividends or other payments  including payments to us  is an unsafe or unsound practice and impose restrictions or prohibit such payments 
it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines a bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
the financial services business is intensely competitive and our success will depend on our ability to compete effectively 
the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
we compete for loans principally through the pricing of interest rates and loan fees and the efficiency and quality of services 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce our market share or cause the prices charged for our services to fall 
improvements in technology  communications  and the internet have intensified competition 
as a result  our competitive position could be weakened  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees and personnel 
we will be dependent for the foreseeable future on the services of r

the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings 
a failure of a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance  which we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance  and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion highlights key information as determined by management but may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding  the following should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december    and included elsewhere in this report 
executive overview the company s net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  from million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   reflecting continuing improvement in credit quality  increased other operating income  and lower other operating expenses 
our provision for loan losses in decreased by million  or  to million from million in as we experienced net recoveries of  in as compared to net charge offs of million in in addition  our nonperforming loans at december  decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  other operating income  which includes revenues from financial services affiliates  service charges  and electronic banking contributed to annual revenues  compared to contributions of to annual revenues 
other operating expenses decreased  or in to million from million in primarily due to decreased salaries and benefits costs and decreased fdic insurance expense 
these decreases were partially offset by decreased gains on sale and rental income from oreo 
the gains on sale and rental income generated from oreo are included as negative expense items in the other operating expense section of the consolidated statement of income 
the company s total assets grew to billion at december  as compared to billion at december   with increases in cash and investments  loans held for sale and purchased receivables offsetting reductions in oreo and portfolio loans 
while loans decreased at december  as compared to the prior year  year to date average loans were up year over year at million for as compared to million in the allowance for loan losses allowance totaled of total portfolio loans at december   compared to at december  the allowance to nonperforming loans also increased to at december  from at december  nonperforming assets were reduced year over year to million at december  or of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at december  the company continued to maintain strong capital ratios with tier capital risk adjusted assets of at december  as compared to a year ago 
the company s tangible common equity to tangible assets at year end was  up from at year end tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non gaap ratio that represents total equity less goodwill and intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets 
the gaap measure of equity to assets is total equity divided by total assets 
total equity to total assets was at december  as compared to at december  the cash dividend paid on december   rose to per diluted share from per diluted share paid in the fourth quarter of critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  are considered critical accounting policies 
we believe that our most 
table of contents critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance to reflect inherent losses in its loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in determining its total allowance  the company first estimates a specific allocated allowance for impaired loans 
this analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan that is collateral dependent  including appraisals on loans secured by real property  management s assessment of the current market  recent payment history  and an evaluation of other sources of repayment 
the company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy 
the company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties  information from other current appraisals  and other sources of information 
the company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its allowance 
the company then estimates a general allocated allowance for all other loans that were not impaired as of the balance sheet date using a formula based approach that includes average historical loss factors that are adjusted for qualitative factors applied to segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the allocated portion of the general reserve of the allowance 
the company first disaggregates the overall loan portfolio into the following segments commercial  real estate construction  real estate term  and home equity lines and other consumer loans 
then the company further disaggregates each segment into the following classes  which are also known as risk classifications excellent  good  satisfactory  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
after the portfolio has been disaggregated into these segments and classes  the company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average four year loss history for each segment and class 
this general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors  by segment and class 
qualitative factors are based on management s assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses 
some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include national and local economic trends  business conditions  underwriting policies and standards  trends in local real estate markets  effects of various political activities  peer group data  and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the company s employees 
finally  the company assesses the overall adequacy of the allowance based on several factors including the level of the allowance as compared to total loans and nonperforming loans in light of current economic conditions 
this portion of the allowance is deemed unallocated because it is not allocated to any segment or class of the loan portfolio 
this portion of the allowance provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating based component or in the specific impairment component of the allowance and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the allocated portions of the allowance 
such factors include uncertainties in identifying triggering events that directly correlate to subsequent loss rates  uncertainties in economic conditions  risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors  and historical loss experience data that may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
in addition  the unallocated reserve may be further adjusted based upon the direction of various risk indicators 
examples of such factors include the risk as to current and prospective economic conditions  the level and trend of charge offs or recoveries  and the risk of heightened imprecision or inconsistency of appraisals used in estimating real estate values 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in aggregate  the total allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance  the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
based on our methodology and its components  management believes the resulting allowance is adequate and appropriate for the risk identified in the company s loan portfolio 
given current processes employed by the company  management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to the company s financial statements 
in addition  current risk ratings and fair value estimates of collateral are subject to change as we continue to review loans within our portfolio and as our borrowers are impacted by economic trends within their market areas 
although we have established an allowance that we consider adequate  there can be no assurance that the established allowance will be sufficient to offset losses on loans in the future 
goodwill and other intangibles net assets of entities acquired in purchase transactions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
identified intangibles are amortized over the period benefited either on a straight line basis or on an 
table of contents accelerated basis depending on the nature of the intangible 
goodwill is not amortized  although it is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or at an interim date if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
in  the company early implemented accounting standards update  testing for goodwill impairment asu 
under this new guidance  the company implemented the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of certain events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit of the company is less than the carrying amount 
we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company exceeds the carrying amount  the company need not move on to step one of the impairment test  and goodwill is not impaired 
if  using the qualitative assessment described above  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the company  then we must move on to a more comprehensive goodwill impairment analysis 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit when the first step indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill in the pro forma business combination accounting as described above exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at december  and in accordance with the policy described in note at december   the company performed its annual impairment test by applying the qualitative assessment described in asu significant positive inputs to the qualitative assessment included the company s capital position  the company s increasing historical trends and budget to actual results of operations  the company s decreasing trends in  and current level of nonperforming assets  results of regulatory examinations  trends and peer comparisons of net interest margin  and trends in the company s cash flows 
significant negative inputs to the qualitative assessment included general local  national  and international economic conditions and how they may negatively affect our business as well as the current volatility and uncertainty related to market capitalization of financial institutions in general 
we believe that the positive inputs to the qualitative assessment noted above outweigh the negative inputs  and we therefore concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company exceeds the carry value at december  and that no potential impairment existed at that time 
the company continues to monitor the company s goodwill for potential impairment on an ongoing basis 
no assurance can be given that we will not charge earnings during for goodwill impairment  if  for example  our stock price declines significantly  although there are many factors that we analyze in determining the impairment of goodwill 
valuation of oreo oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or its equivalent 
prior to foreclosure  the carrying value is adjusted to the fair value  less cost to sell  of the real estate to be acquired by an adjustment to the allowance for loan loss 
the amount by which the fair value less cost to sell is greater than the carrying amount of the loan plus amounts previously charged off is recognized in earnings 
any subsequent reduction in the carrying value is charged against earnings 
reductions in the carrying value of other real estate owned subsequent to acquisition are determined based on management s estimate of the fair value of individual properties 
significant inputs into this estimate include estimated costs to complete projects as well as our assessment of current market conditions 
results of operations net income our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income 
we also generate other income primarily through purchased receivables products  service charges and fees  sales of employee benefit plans  electronic banking income  earnings from our mortgage affiliate  and rental income 
our operating expenses consist in large part of compensation  employee benefits expense  occupancy  marketing  professional and outside services  insurance expense  and expenses related to oreo 
interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities 

table of contents we earned net income of million in  compared to net income of million in  and million in during these periods  net income per diluted share was   and  respectively 
the increase in was due to decreases in the provision for loan losses and other operating expenses of million and  respectively and an increase in other operating income of  these changes were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of million in as compared to  as well as an increase in the provision for income taxes of  over the same period 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income from loan and investment securities portfolios and interest expense on customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income in was million  compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to the lower yield on loans and investments in as compared to which was only partially offset by decreased interest expense from lower average interest rates on deposits 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower average loan balances  coupled with a slightly lower yield on loans in as compared to which was only partially offset by decreased interest expense from lower average interest rates on both deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and spread  which in turn affect our margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
changes in net interest income are influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
during the fiscal years ended december    and  average interest earning assets were million  million  and million  respectively 
during these same periods  net interest margins were   and  respectively  which reflects the changes in our balance sheet mix 
our average yield on interest earning assets was in  in  and in  while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was in  in  and in our net interest margin decreased in from mainly due to the fact that in  interest rates on both loans and investment securities declined as compared to these decreases were only partially offset by increases in net interest income due to higher average balances in interest bearing assets 
the net interest margin decreased in from mainly due to the fact that in  the mix of average interest earning assets included lower average loan balances and higher average balances in securities and short term investments as compared to loans have a significantly higher yield than securities and short term investments  so the shift in average balances in these asset categories significantly impacts the overall yield on interest earnings assets

all of our loans and credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness and commitments to us  including the indebtedness of any guarantor

commercial loans represented of our total loans outstanding as of december  and reprice more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent repricing means that interest cash flows from commercial loans are more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to emphasize the pricing of loans on a floating rate basis  which allows these loans to reprice more frequently and to contribute positively to our net interest margin 
the majority of these loans reprice to an index based upon the prime rate of interest 
the company also uses floors in its commercial loan pricing as loans are originated or renewed during the year

if the loan has not yet matured  the debtors may cure the events of default up to the time of sale to retain their interest in the collateral

the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and loan recoveries and decreased by loan charge offs 
the size of the allowance is determined through quarterly assessments of probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for making such assessments and determining the adequacy of the allowance includes the following key elements a specific allocation for impaired loans 
management determined the fair value of the majority of these loans based on the underlying collateral values 
this analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan  including external appraisals on loans secured by real property  management s assessment of the current market  recent payment history  and an evaluation of other sources of repayment 
in house evaluations of fair value are used in the impairment analysis in some situations 
inputs to the in house evaluation process include information about sales of comparable properties in the appropriate markets and changes in tax assessed values 
the company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy 
the company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties  information from other current appraisals  and other 
table of contents sources of information 
appraisals may be adjusted downward by the company based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis 
external appraisals may be discounted when management believes that the absorption period used in the appraisal is unrealistic  when expected liquidation costs exceed those included in the appraisal  or when management s evaluation of deteriorating market conditions warrants an adjustment 
additionally  the company may also adjust appraisals in the above circumstances between appraisal dates 
the company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its allowance 
the specific allowance for impaired loans  as well as the overall allowance  may increase based on the company s assessment of updated appraisals 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of the company s estimation of the fair value of impaired loans 
when the company determines that a loss has occurred on an impaired loan  a charge off equal to the difference between carrying value and fair value is recorded 
if a specific allowance is deemed necessary for a loan  and then that loan is partially charged off  the loan remains classified as a nonperforming loan after the charge off is recognized 
loans measured for impairment based on collateral value and all other loans measured for impairment are accounted for in the same way 
the total annualized charge off rate for nonperforming loans as of december  and was and  respectively 
a general allocation 
the company has identified segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the general allocation allowance 
the company determined the disaggregation of the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on its assessment of how different pools of loans with like characteristics in the portfolio behave over time 
this determination is based on historical experience and management s assessment of how current facts and circumstances are expected to affect the loan portfolio 
the company first disaggregates the loan portfolio into the following segments commercial  real estate construction  real estate term  and home equity lines and other consumer loans 
then the company further disaggregates each of these segments into the following classes  which are also known as risk classifications excellent  good  satisfactory  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
after the portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and classes  the company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average year loss history for each segment and class 
the company s loan portfolio continues to include a concentration in a small number of large borrowers 
in  the company increased the look back period used in the calculation of average historical loss rates from three years to four years 
management made this change because we believe that including the elevated loss experience from that occurred as a result of the economic downturn from that time is appropriate 
management believes that including the loss experience from in the current allowance calculation appropriately captures the inherent risk this concentration brings to our loan portfolio 
after the company calculates a general allocation using our loss history  the general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors by segment and class 
qualitative factors are based on management s assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses 
some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include national and local economic trends  business conditions  underwriting policies and standards  trends in local real estate markets  effects of various political activities  peer group data  and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the company s employees 
an unallocated reserve 
the unallocated portion of the allowance provides for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the specific and general components of the allowance  and it acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
the unallocated component is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses and overall economic conditions 
at december  and  the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total allowance was  respectively 
the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total allowance was at december  as reported in the company s form k for the year ended december  the decrease in the unallocated allowance as a percentage of the total allowance at december  and is due in part to an enhancement to the company s methodology 
the company refined its method of estimating the allowance in the third quarter of the company elected this enhanced method of estimating the allowance because we believe that it more accurately allocates expected losses by loan segment and class 
the company performed a retrospective review of the allowance as of december   march  and june  and determined that this refinement does not have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or earnings per share for any period  rather  the refined method of estimating the allowance changes how the total allowance is allocated among the company s loan types and the unallocated portion of the allowance 

table of contents the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for the periods indicated and includes allocations calculated under the enhanced methodology for and allocations shown for   and were calculated using the legacy methodology and were reported as such in prior years december  allowance applicable to amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans in thousands commercial construction real estate term home equity lines and other consumer unallocated total represents percentage of this category of loans to total loans

the decrease in real estate charge offs in as compared to and the increase in as compared to is related to one borrower 
the increase in real estate charge offs in as compared to related to two borrowers 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses in as compared to is due primarily to the decrease in net charge offs for the year 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance  unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the allowance  and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the allowance

fhlb advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans  although all fhlb advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the company s assets 
there was no outstanding balance on this line at december  or federal reserve bank the company entered into a note agreement with the federal reserve bank on december  for the payment of tax deposits

the operating lease obligations are more fully described in note of the company s financial statements attached to this report 
other long term liabilities consist of amounts that the company owes for its investments in delaware limited partnerships that develop low income housing projects throughout the united states 
the company purchased a million interest in usa institutional tax credit fund lvii usa usa in december the investment in usa is expected to be fully funded in off balance sheet arrangements commitments and contingent liabilities the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
among the off balance sheet items entered into in the ordinary course of business are commitments to extend credit and the issuance of letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the balance sheet 
certain commitments are collateralized 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as in all of our lending activities and include these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
as of december  we had commitments to extend credit of million which were not reflected on our balance sheet 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
these commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the company if certain conditions of the contract are violated 
collateral held relating to these commitments varies  but generally includes real estate  inventory  accounts receivable  and equipment 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  these total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
for additional information regarding the company s off balance sheet arrangement  see note and liquidity and capital resources below 
as of december  we had standby letters of credit of million which were not reflected on our balance sheet 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer 
table of contents to a third party 
credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the company upon default of performance 
collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer s creditworthiness 
our total unfunded lending commitments at december   which includes commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  were million 
we do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time 
the company has established reserves of  and  at december  and  respectively  for losses related to these commitments that is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources the company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from the bank 
such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the bank 
banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of  or require the bank to obtain certain approvals before paying  dividends to the company 
given that the bank is currently well capitalized  the company expects to continue to receive dividends from the bank 
the bank manages its liquidity through its asset and liability committee 
our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
these funds  together with loan repayments  loan sales  other borrowed funds  retained earnings  and equity are used to make loans  to acquire securities and other assets  and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations 
the primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments 
our total unfunded commitments to fund loans and letters of credit at december   were million 
we do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time 
additionally  as noted above  our total deposits at december   were million 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash used by operating activities was million in  and net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the primary reason that net cash from operating activities was negative in was the fact that we purchased million in loans held for sale and only sold million of those loans as of december  this is a timing difference in cash flows that we expect to reverse for the most part in the first quarter of the primary source of cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented was positive net income in each of these periods 
net cash of  and million was provided in investing activities in and as the company collected funds from loan pay offs that exceeded net cash outlays related to portfolio investments 
net cash of million was used in investing activities in as the company invested available cash primarily in available for sale securities 
the million and million of cash provided by financing activities in and  respectively  primarily consisted of the million and million increases in deposits during and net cash used in financing activities in of million was the result of the pay down of borrowings taken on in  which was partially offset by increased deposit balances 
the sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
at december   our current assets were million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were million 
given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs  we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
however  continued deterioration in the fhlb of seattle s financial position may result in impairment in the value of our fhlb stock  the requirement that the company contribute additional funds to recapitalize the fhlb of seattle  or a reduction in the company s ability to borrow funds from the fhlb of seattle  impairing the company s ability to meet liquidity demands 
on february   the board of directors approved payment of a per share dividend on march   to shareholders of record on march  this dividend is consistent with the company s dividends that were declared and paid in in september  our board of directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately of our shares of common stock in the open market 
we purchased as aggregate of  shares of our stock under this program through december  at a total cost of million at an average price of  which left a balance of  shares available under the stock repurchase program 
we intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time to time depending upon market conditions  but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will repurchase all of the authorized shares 
no repurchases occurred during and 
table of contents the stock repurchase program had a positive effect on earnings per share because it decreased the total number of shares outstanding in by  shares 
the company did not repurchase any of its shares in   or the table below shows this effect on diluted earnings per share

our shareholders equity at december   was million  as compared to million at december  the company earned net income of million during and issued  shares through the exercise of stock options 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in at december   the company had million shares of its common stock outstanding 
we are subject to minimum capital requirements 
federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leverage capital 
we believe as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a well capitalized institution by regulatory standards 
the fdic has in place qualifications for banks to be classified as well capitalized 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized northrim bank as well capitalized 
there were no conditions or events since the fdic notification that we believe have changed northrim bank s classification 

table of contents the table below illustrates the capital requirements for the company and the bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements 
based on recent turmoil in the financial markets  management intends to maintain a tier risk based capital ratio for the bank in excess of in  exceeding the fdic s well capitalized capital requirement classification 
the capital ratios for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offering that the company completed in the second quarter of and another offering of million completed in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes although they are accounted for as a long term debt in our financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital 
as a result  the company has million more in regulatory capital than the bank  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities 
december  adequately capitalized well capitalized actual ratio company actual ratio bank tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio see note of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the capital ratios 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates  which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation has an impact on our customers ability to repay their loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the disclosures in this item are qualified by the risk factors set forth in item a and the section entitled note regarding forward looking statements included in part i in this report and any other cautionary statements contained herein 
the company s results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income and are largely dependent upon our ability to manage market risks 
the company does not presently use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  by competition  by changes in interest rates  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results of operations particularly dependent on the alaska economy 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that financial performance will decline over time due to changes in prevailing interest rates and resulting yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities 
generally  there are three sources of interest rate risk as described below re pricing risk generally  re pricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institution s assets and liabilities 
basis risk basis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity 
option risk in banking  option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits  withdrawals  and early redemptions 
option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right  but not the obligation  to alter the quantity of the timing of cash flows 
asset liability and interest rate risk management the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting a target range and minimum for the net interest margin and running simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including interest sensitivity gap analyses and income simulations 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net 
table of contents interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include loan and deposit volumes and pricing  prepayment speeds on fixed rate assets  and cash flows and maturities of other investment securities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
interest rate sensitivity although analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk  we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance it should not be used as the primary indicator of exposure to interest rate risk and the related volatility of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate gap analysis is primarily a measure of liquidity based upon the amount of change in principal amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding  as opposed to a measure of changes in the overall net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data based upon regulatory reporting formats and  therefore  may not be wholly consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in the audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  within year years years total in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits in other banks portfolio investments loans commercial real estate construction real estate term loans held for sale home equity line and other consumer total interest earning assets percent of total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities percent of total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets 
table of contents as stated previously  certain shortcomings  including those described below  are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in their interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the lives of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables as can the relationship of rates between different loan and deposit categories 
moreover  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
as indicated in the table above  at december   the company s interest earning assets reprice or mature faster than the company s interest bearing liabilities by a margin of million over the next months 
as of december   the company s interest bearing liabilities repriced or matured faster than the company s earning assets by a margin of million over the next months 
the following table sets forth the results of the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year based on the results of our interest rate simulation model as of december  and for the scenarios shown below  the interest rate simulation assumes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at the beginning of a twelve month period and no changes in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
change in net interest income from base scenario percentage change change in net interest income from base scenario percentage change scenario dollars in thousands up basis points up basis points down basis points nm nm the increase in the change in net interest income from the up and up basis point scenarios above is a result of the shift to an asset sensitive position at december  as compared to the liability sensitive position at december  the results of the down basis point scenario at december  are not measurable since interest rates were already at a low point and a further decrease resulted in some indexes being nonexistent 
impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates
