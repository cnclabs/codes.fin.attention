item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated food manufacturing company headquartered in shandong province  china 
we develop  manufacture and sell the following types of food products chestnut products  convenience foods including ready to cook  or rtc  foods  ready to eat  or rte  foods and meals ready to eat  or mre  and frozen food products 
we conduct our production activities in china 
our products are sold in provinces and administrative regions in china and foreign countries 
we believe that we are the largest chestnut processor and manufacturer in china 
we have developed brand equity for our chestnut products in china  japan and south korea over the past to years 
we produced high value added processed chestnut products in we derive most of our revenues from sales in china  japan and south korea 
in  our primary strategy was to continue building our brand recognition in china through consistent marketing efforts towards supermarkets  wholesalers  and significant customers 
del  del 
 enhancing the cooperation with other manufacturers and factories 
del  del 
and enhancing the turnover for our exsting chestnut  convenience and frozen food products 
in addition  we are working to expand our marketing efforts in asia  europe and the middle east 
we currently have limited sales and marketing activity in the united states  although our long term plan is to significantly expand our activities there 
production factors that affect our financial and operational condition our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various agricultural products  including chestnuts  vegetables  fruits  red meat  fish  eggs  rice  flour and packaging products 
during  the cost of our raw materials increased from  to  for an increase of approximately 
we may have to increase the number of our suppliers of raw materials and expand our own agricultural operations in the future to meet growing production demands 
despite our efforts to control our supply of raw materials and maintain good relationships with our suppliers  we could lose one or more of our suppliers at any time 
the loss of several suppliers may be difficult to replace and could increase our reliance on higher cost or lower quality suppliers  which could negatively affect our profitability 
in addition  if we have to increase the number of our suppliers of raw materials in the future to meet growing production demands  we may not be able to locate new suppliers who could provide us with sufficient materials to meet our needs 
any interruptions to  or decline in  the amount or quality of our raw materials supply could materially disrupt our production and adversely affect our business and financial condition and financial prospects 
the average price that we paid for chestnuts in and was approximately  per metric ton and  per metric ton  respectively  excluding value added taxes 
in past few years  increasing inflation pressures weighed on the chinese economy  as well as on agricultural products 
we do not have effective means and do not currently hedge against changes in our raw material prices 
consequently  if the costs of our raw materials increase further and we are unable to offset these increases by raising the prices of our products  our profit margins and financial condition could be adversely affected 
uncertainties that affect our financial condition we spend a significant amount of cash on our operations  principally to procure raw materials for our products 
many of our suppliers  including chestnut  vegetable and fruit farmers  and suppliers of packaging materials  require us to pay for their supplies in cash on the same day that such supplies are delivered to us 
however  some of the suppliers with whom we have a long standing business relationship allow us to pay on credit 
we fund the majority of our working capital requirements out of cash flow generated from operations 
if we fail to generate sufficient sales  or if our suppliers stop offering us credit terms  we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operating costs and our business could be adversely affected 
we also funded approximately and of our working capital requirements in and  respectively  from the proceeds of short term loans from chinese banks 
we expect to continue to do so in the future 
such loans are generally secured by our fixed assets  receivables and or guarantees by third parties 
our average loan balance from short term bank loans in and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the term of almost all such loans is one year or less 
historically  we have rolled over such loans on an annual basis 
however  commencing  the chinese government has implemented more stringent credit policies to curb inflation and soaring property prices  which could negatively impact our ability to obtain or roll over these short term loans  and hence not having sufficient funds available to pay all of our borrowings upon maturity 
failure to roll over our short term borrowings at maturity or to service our debt could result in the imposition of penalties  including increases in rates of interest  legal actions against us by our creditors  or even insolvency 
in addition  we completed two private placement financings in september and october with net proceeds of million and million  respectively  the proceeds of which were primarily used as working capital 
we also secured a million loan from deutsche investitions und entwicklungsgesellshaft deg in may  which we have fully drawn down as of december we can provide no assurances that we will be able to enter into any future financing or refinancing agreements on terms favorable to us  especially considering the current instability of the capital markets 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  cash flows from operations  current and expected short term bank loans  as well as remaining proceeds from the september private placement and the loan from deg will be adequate to satisfy our liquidity requirements through however  if available liquidity is not sufficient to meet our operating and loan obligations as they come due  our plans include considering pursuing alternative financing arrangements or further reducing expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements 
however  there is no assurance that  if required  we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity 
currently  the capital markets for small capitalization companies are difficult and banking institutions have become stringent in their lending requirements 
accordingly  we cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any third party financing 
the crisis of the financial and credit markets worldwide in the second half of has led to a severe economic recession worldwide 
furthermore  the european countries experienced severe debt crisis during and which further weighed on the global economic conditions as well as the financial market 
the outlook for is still uncertain  but continuation or worsening of unfavorable economic conditions  including the ongoing global economy and capital markets disruptions  could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition in a number of ways 
for example  we may experience declines in revenues  profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced orders  delays in receiving orders  delays or defaults in payment or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and prospective customers 
we may experience supply chain delays  disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors 
in addition  changes and volatility in the equity  credit and foreign exchange markets and in the competitive landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings into the future 
in and  some of our customers  including some of our large supermarket customers  delayed their payments for up to to days beyond their term 
our cash flow suffered while waiting for such payments 
consequently  at times we had to delay payments to our suppliers and to postpone business expansion as a result of these delayed payments 
starting in and through  we gradually shortened credit terms for many of our international and domestic customers from between and days to between and days 
our large customers may fail to meet these shortened credit terms  in which case we may not have sufficient cash flow to fund our operating costs and our business could be adversely affected

liquidity and capital resources general our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products and expanding our facilities 
in the past  our primary sources of financing have been cash generated from operations and short term loans from banks in china 
in october and september  we obtained approximately million and million  respectively  from two private placement transactions 
we also secured a million loan from deutsche investitions und entwicklungsgesellshaft deg in may which we have fully drawn down as of december proceeds from the private placement transactions and cash drawn down from the deg loan  together with cash generated from operations and short term bank loans  have been primarily used to fund our working capital needs  as well as addition to our construction in progress and purchase of fixed assets 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash were million million  respectively 
we expect to continue to finance our operations and working capital needs in from cash generated from operations and short term bank loans 
in addition  we currently plan to finance or refinance approximately million in the form of short term bank loans in we expect that anticipated cash flows from operations and short term bank loans will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months 
if available liquidity is not sufficient to meet our operating and loan obligations as they come due  our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements or reducing expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide liquidity  if needed 
currently  the capital markets for small capitalization companies are difficult 
accordingly  we cannot be sure of the availability or terms of any alternative financing arrangements

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following method of accounting we maintain our general ledger and journals with the accrual method accounting for financial reporting purposes 
the financial statements and notes are representations of management 
accounting policies adopted by us conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the presentation of financial statements  which are compiled on the accrual basis of accounting 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made  however  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the use of estimates is critical to carrying value of asset accounts such as accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets  and intangible assets 
we use estimates to account for the related bad debt allowance  inventory impairment charges  depreciation and amortization of our assets 
in the food processing industry these accounts have a significant impact on the valuation of our balance sheet and the results of our operations 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and include the accounts of the company and its commonly controlled entity 
all significant inter company balances and transactions are eliminated in combination 
as of december   the particulars of the commonly controlled entities are as follows place of attributable equity registered name of company incorporation interest capital shandong lorain co  ltd prc  luotian lorain co  ltd prc  junan hongrun foodstuff co  ltd prc  beijing lorain co  ltd prc  shandong greenpia foodstuff co  ltd prc  dongguan lorain co  ltd prc  international lorain holding inc cayman islands accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes 
determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the reporting years  there was no impairment loss 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue 
our revenue consists of invoiced value of goods  net of a value added tax vat 
no product return or sales discount allowance is made as products delivered and accepted by customers are normally not returnable and sales discount is normally not granted after products are delivered 
we believe that when custody and title of goods has been passed to our customers  or third party transporters revenue is recognized 
our industry does not call for revenue recognition under multiple deliverable arrangements 
financial instruments our financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivable  advances to suppliers  advances to employees  bank loans and notes  accounts payable  other payable  accrued liabilities  and long term liabilities 
the recorded values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivable  advances to suppliers  advances to employees  bank loans and notes  accounts payable  other payable  and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values based on their short term nature 
the recorded values of long term liabilities approximate their fair values  as interest approximates market rates 
we have the accounting policy regarding financial instruments for our financial statements in and we consider it critical because our business is becoming more global in nature and the use of fair value for financial instruments has been widely adopted by accounting bodies around the globe 
with financial statements that are widely accepted and comparable in many jurisdictions we will have greater access to capital locally
