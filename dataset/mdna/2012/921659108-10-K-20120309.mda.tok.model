item business overview vanda pharmaceuticals inc we  vanda or the company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of central nervous system disorders 
we believe that each of our products and partnered products will address a large market with significant unmet medical needs by offering advantages over currently available therapies 
our product portfolio includes fanapt  a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia  the oral formulation of which is currently being marketed and sold in the us by novartis  and tasimelteon  a compound for the treatment of sleep and mood disorders  including circadian rhythm sleep disorders crsd  which is currently in clinical development 
throughout this annual report on form k  we refer to fanapt within the us and canada as our partnered product and we refer to fanapt outside the us and canada and tasimelteon as our products 
all other compounds are referred to herein as our product candidates 
in addition  we refer to our partnered products  products and product candidates collectively as our compounds 
moreover  we refer to drug products generally as drugs or products 
since we began our operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our compounds 
our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability largely depends on novartis ability to successfully commercialize fanapt in the us and to successfully develop and commercialize fanapt in canada and upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the development of our products or product candidates  and to obtain the regulatory approvals for and manufacture  market and sell our products and product candidates 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of part i of this annual report on form k  entitled risk factors 
our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital throughout and beyond 
we are currently concentrating our efforts on our four on going clinical trials for tasimelteon for the treatment of non hour disorder nhd and our on going clinical trial for tasimelteon for the treatment of major depressive disorder mdd 
we plan to continue the clinical  regulatory and commercial evaluation of tasimelteon  including exploring the path to a new drug application nda for tasimelteon 
additionally  we and our partners have engaged in discussions with several foreign regulatory agencies to review their filing requirements with respect to fanapt 
our founder and chief executive officer  mihael h 
polymeropoulos  md  started our operations early in after establishing and leading the pharmacogenetics department at novartis 
in acquiring and developing our compounds  we have relied upon our deep expertise in the scientific disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics 
these scientific disciplines examine both genetic variations among people that influence response to a particular drug  and the multiple pathways through which drugs affect people 
we believe that the combination of our expertise in these disciplines and our drug development expertise may provide us with preferential access to compounds discovered by other pharmaceutical companies  and will allow us to identify new uses for these compounds 
these capabilities should also enable us to shorten the time it takes to commercialize a drug when compared to traditional approaches 
fanapt and tasimelteon both target large prescription markets with significant unmet medical needs 
we believe that fanapt may address some of the shortcomings of other currently available drugs  based on its observed safety profile and the extended release injectable formulation for fanapt that novartis plans to develop further 
approved drugs in both the sleep and mood disorders markets have sub optimal safety and efficacy profiles 
we believe tasimelteon may represent an additional option for the treatment of these disorders  based on its potential to be the first compound approved as a circadian regulator with a demonstrated ability to reset the body clock and align it to a constant hour day 
our strategy our goal is to create a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that address critical unmet medical needs relating to central nervous system disorders through the application of our drug development expertise and our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
the key elements of our strategy to accomplish this goal are to pursue the clinical development and regulatory approval of our products and product candidates 
on may   the us food and drug administration fda granted us marketing approval of fanapt for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis 
we had originally entered into a sublicense agreement with novartis on june  pursuant to which we obtained certain worldwide exclusive licenses from novartis relating to fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt in the us and canada 
on january   novartis launched fanapt in the us we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
we have successfully completed a phase iii trial of tasimelteon in transient insomnia and announced positive top line results in november in addition  we have successfully completed a phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia and announced positive top line results in june on january   the fda granted orphan drug designation status for tasimelteon in a specific crsd  nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting  or fewer us patients per year 
orphan drug designation provides potential financial and regulatory incentives  including study design assistance  tax credits  waiver of fda user fees  and up to seven years of market exclusivity upon marketing approval 
on february   the european commission ec designated tasimelteon as an orphan medicinal product for the same indication 
we initiated four clinical trials to pursue fda approval of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
we plan to conduct these clinical trials over the next one to two years to support the use of tasimelteon as a circadian regulator and the submission of a nda to the fda and a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema 
we are currently in discussions with the fda on the most appropriate way to analyze and present data so that the effect of tasimelteon can be evaluated 
in addition  we initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial magellan to study the efficacy of tasimelteon for the treatment of mdd 
enter into partnerships to extend our commercial reach 
we may seek additional commercial partners for fanapt outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt outside of the us and canada  or  alternatively  at novartis option  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt outside of the us and canada 
novartis has chosen not to co commercialize fanapt in europe and certain other countries and will instead receive a royalty on net sales in those countries 
those countries include  but are not limited to  the countries in the european union  as well as switzerland  norway  liechtenstein and iceland 
in addition  given the range of potential indications for tasimelteon  we may pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of tasimelteon worldwide 
apply our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise to differentiate our products and product candidates 
we believe that our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise will yield new insights into our products and product candidates 
these insights may enable us to target our products and product candidates to certain patient populations and to identify unexpected conditions for our products and product candidates to treat 
expand our product portfolio through the identification and acquisition of additional compounds 
we intend to continue to draw upon our clinical development expertise and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise to identify and pursue the acquisition of additional clinical stage compounds

these include  but are not limited to  the countries in the european union  as well as switzerland  norway  liechtenstein and iceland 
we continue to explore the regulatory path and commercial opportunity for fanapt oral formulation outside of the us and canada 
on july   the ema notified us that it had accepted for evaluation the maa for oral iloperidone tablets 
we have received the initial list of comments from the ema and have been granted a three month extension of the review cycle in order to better prepare our responses to these comments 
we have entered into agreements with the following partners for the commercialization of fanapt in the countries set forth below country partner mexico probiomed sa de sa argentina biotoscana farma sa israel megapharm ltd 
therapeutic opportunity schizophrenia is a chronic  debilitating mental disorder characterized by hallucinations  delusions  racing thoughts and other psychotic symptoms collectively referred to as positive symptoms  as well as moodiness  anhedonia inability to feel pleasure  loss of interest  eating disturbances and withdrawal collectively referred to as negative symptoms  and additionally attention and memory deficits collectively referred to as cognitive symptoms 
schizophrenia develops in late adolescence or early adulthood in approximately of the world s population 
most schizophrenia patients today are treated with drugs known as atypical antipsychotics  which were first approved in the us in the late s 
these antipsychotics have been named atypical for their ability to treat a broader range of negative symptoms than the first generation typical antipsychotics  which were introduced in the s and are now generic 
atypical antipsychotics are generally regarded as having improved side effect profiles and efficacy relative to typical antipsychotics and currently comprise approximately of schizophrenia prescriptions 
currently approved atypical antipsychotics include  in addition to fanapt  risperdal risperidone  including the depot formulation risperdal consta  and invega paliperidone  including the depot formulation invega sustenna  each by ortho mcneil janssen pharmaceuticals  inc  zyprexa olanzapine  including the depot formulation zyprexa relprevv  by eli lilly and company  seroquel quetiapine by astrazeneca plc  abilify aripiprazole by bms otsuka pharmaceutical co  ltd  geodon ziprasidone by pfizer inc  saphris asenapine by schering plough  latuda lurasidone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  and generic clozapine 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis is responsible for the further clinical development of the long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt 
the depot formulation is administered once every four weeks and we believe will be a compelling complement to the oral formulation for both physicians and patients 
novartis conducted a two month phase i iia safety trial of this formulation in schizophrenia patients  in which it demonstrated the benefit of consistent release over a four week time period with no greater side effects relative to oral dosing 
novartis is presently conducting a phase ii study to identify the optimal depot formulation for continued development 
the commercial potential for the extended release injectable formulation has been demonstrated by the success of the injectable formulation for risperidone  risperdal consta  which achieved worldwide sales of approximately billion in the year ended march   according to press releases issued by alkermes  inc intellectual property fanapt and its metabolites  formulations  genetic markers and uses are covered by a total of patent and patent application families worldwide 
the primary new chemical entity patent covering fanapt expired normally in in the us and expired in in major markets outside the us in the us  the united states drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  more commonly known as the hatch waxman act provides for an extension of new chemical entity patents for a period of up to five years following the expiration of the patent covering that compound to compensate for time spent in development 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term extension and so the term of the new chemical entity patent in the us has been extended until november in addition  we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity potentially extending the term of the new chemical entity patent in the us until may in europe  statutes provide for ten years of data exclusivity with the potential for an additional year if the drug is developed for a significant new indication 
no generic versions of fanapt would be permitted to be marketed or sold during this year or year period in most european countries 
consequently  assuming that pediatric exclusivity is granted by the fda and that we receive regulatory approval in europe  we expect that novartis rights to commercialize fanapt will be exclusive until may in the us and our rights to commercialize fanapt will be exclusive for at least years from approval in europe 
the patent for the microsphere long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt expires in in the us and in most of the major markets in europe 
the pending patent application for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in the us the patent for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in most of the major markets in europe 
several other patent applications covering metabolites  uses  formulations and genetic markers relating to fanapt extend beyond we acquired worldwide  exclusive rights to the new chemical entity patent covering fanapt and certain related intellectual property from novartis under a sublicense agreement we entered into in  which was restated and amended in please see license agreements below for a more complete description of the rights we acquired from and relinquished to novartis with respect to fanapt 
tasimelteon tasimelteon is an oral compound in development for sleep and mood disorders  including crsd 
the compound binds selectively to the brain s melatonin receptors  which are thought to govern the body s natural sleep wake cycle 
compounds that bind selectively to these receptors are thought to be able to help treat sleep disorders  and additionally are believed to offer potential benefits in mood disorders 
we announced positive top line results from our phase iii trial of tasimelteon in transient insomnia in november in june  we announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia 
on january   the fda granted orphan drug designation status for tasimelteon in a specific crsd  nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting  or fewer us patients per year 
orphan drug designation provides potential financial and regulatory incentives  including study design assistance  tax credits  waiver of fda user fees  and up to seven years of market exclusivity upon marketing approval 
on february   the ec designated tasimelteon as an orphan medicinal product for the same indication 
we initiated four clinical trials to pursue fda approval of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
two of the clinical trials were initiated in the third quarter of  the third was initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth was initiated in the fourth quarter of we plan to conduct these clinical trials over the next one to two years to support the use of tasimelteon as a circadian regulator and the submission of a nda to the fda and a maa to the ema 
we are currently in discussions with the fda on the most appropriate way to analyze and present data so that the effect of tasimelteon can be evaluated 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial magellan to study the efficacy of tasimelteon for the treatment of mdd 
therapeutic opportunity sleep disorders are segmented into three major categories primary insomnia  secondary insomnia and crsds 
insomnia is a symptom complex that comprises difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep  or non refreshing sleep  in combination with daytime dysfunction or distress 
the symptom complex can be an independent disorder primary insomnia or be a result of another condition such as depression or anxiety secondary insomnia 
crsd results from a misalignment of the sleep wake cycle and an individual s daily activities or lifestyle 
the circadian rhythm is the rhythmic output of the human biological clock and is governed primarily by the hormone melatonin 
both the timing of behavioral events activity  sleep  and social interactions and the environmental light dark cycle result in a sleep wake cycle that follows the circadian rhythm 
examples of crsd include transient disorders such as jet lag and chronic disorders such as shift work sleep disorder and nhd 
based on market research we have conducted with lek consulting we believe that crsd represents a significant portion of the market for sleep disorders 
while there are no fda approved treatments for insomnia specifically related to crsd  there are a number of drugs approved and prescribed for patients with sleep disorders 
the most commonly prescribed drugs are hypnotics  such as generic zolpidem  ambien zolpidem by sanofi aventis including ambien cr  lunesta eszopiclone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  sonata zaleplon by pfizer inc and silenor doxepin by somaxon pharmaceuticals  inc hypnotics work by acting upon a set of brain receptors known as gaba receptors  which are separate and distinct from the melatonin receptors to which tasimelteon binds 
several drugs in development also utilize a mechanism of action involving binding to gaba receptors 
members of the benzodiazapine class of sedatives are also approved for insomnia  but their usage has declined due to an inferior safety profile compared to hypnotics 
anecdotal evidence also suggests that sedative antidepressants  such as trazodone and doxepin  are prescribed off label for insomnia 
fda approved drugs for the treatment of insomnia also include rozerem ramelteon by takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  a compound with a mechanism of action similar to tasimelteon 
limitations of current treatments we believe that each of the drugs currently used to treat insomnia has inherent limitations that leave patients underserved 
the key limitations include the potential for abuse  significant side effects  and a failure to address the underlying causes of sleeplessness many of the products prescribed commonly for sleep disorders  including ambien  lunesta  and sonata  are classified as schedule iv controlled substances by the united states drug enforcement administration dea due to their potential for abuse  tolerance and withdrawal symptoms 
drugs that are classified as schedule iv controlled substances are subject to restrictions on how such drugs are prescribed and dispensed 
many drugs approved for and used in sleep disorders also induce a number of nuisance side effects beyond the more serious abuse and addiction effects associated with most approved products 
these side effects include next day grogginess  memory loss  unpleasant taste  dry mouth and hormonal changes 
we believe that none of the drugs used and approved for sleep  other than rozerem  work through the body s natural sleep wake cycle  which is governed by melatonin 
we believe that  for patients whose sleep disruption is due to a misalignment of this sleep wake cycle as is the case in crsd  a drug that naturally modulates the sleep wake cycle would be an attractive new alternative because it would address the underlying cause of the sleeplessness  rather than merely addressing its symptoms 
potential advantages of tasimelteon we believe that tasimelteon may offer efficacy similar to the most efficacious of the approved sleep drugs  and that it may provide significant benefits to patients beyond those offered by the approved drugs 
we believe that tasimelteon is unlikely to be scheduled as a controlled substance by the dea because rozerem  which has a similar mechanism of action to tasimelteon  was shown not to have potential for abuse and was not classified as a schedule iv controlled substance by the dea 
however  despite the fact that the drugs have a similar mechanism of action  our phase iii results have demonstrated that tasimelteon may offer superior sleep maintenance to rozerem 
tasimelteon also appears to be safe and well tolerated  with no significant side effects or effects on next day performance 
for patients with crsds  tasimelteon may represent a breakthrough treatment option based on the compound s demonstrated ability to reset the body clock and align it with the hour day 
this ability to regulate the circadian rhythm was observed in four patients during the initial run in segment of the reset study 
the reset study is a phase iii study of the maintenance effect of tasimelteon in the treatment of nhd 
overview of phase iii clinical trials in november  we reported positive top line results in a randomized  double blind  multi center  placebo controlled phase iii trial that enrolled adults in a sleep laboratory setting using a phase advance  first night assessment model of induced transient insomnia 
the trial examined tasimelteon dosed minutes before bedtime at  and milligrams versus placebo 
tasimelteon achieved significant results in multiple endpoints  demonstrating a benefit in both sleep onset  or time to fall asleep  and sleep maintenance  or ability to stay asleep 
based on these trial results  we believe that tasimelteon will compare favorably to efficacy achieved by currently approved insomnia drugs  not only for crsds but also for other types of insomnia 
the phase iii trial also demonstrated that tasimelteon was safe and well tolerated  with no significant side effects versus placebo and no impairment of next day performance or mood 
in june  we reported positive top line results in a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase iii trail in chronic primary insomnia that enrolled patients 
the trial examined tasimelteon at and milligrams versus placebo over a period of days 
the trial measured time to fall asleep and sleep maintenance  as well as next day performance 
we have initiated four clinical trials to pursue fda approval of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
two of the clinical trials were initiated in the third quarter of  the third was initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth was initiated in the fourth quarter of the first clinical trial set is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study with a planned enrollment of approximately patients with nhd 
the trial has a six month treatment period and includes measures of both nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as laboratory measures of the synchronization between the internal body clock and the hour environmental light dark cycle 
the second clinical trial is a one year safety study of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd 
this trial is an open label safety study with a planned enrollment of up to patients with nhd 
the third clinical trial reset is a placebo controlled  randomized withdrawal study to examine the maintenance effect of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd with a planned enrollment of up to patients with nhd 
patients will be followed for weeks during which nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as synchronization of their internal body clock to the hour day  will continue to be evaluated 
the fourth clinical trial is a two year open label  multicenter  study in blind subjects with nhd to assess the safety of tasimelteon 
we plan to conduct these clinical trials over the next one to two years to support the use of tasimelteon as a circadian regulator and the submission of a nda to the fda and a maa to the ema 
we are currently in discussions with the fda on the most appropriate way to analyze and present data so that the effect of tasimelteon can be evaluated 
potential indication for depression we believe that tasimelteon may also be effective in treating depression 
agomelatine  another drug that acts on the brain s melatonin receptors  has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of depression that compared favorably to an approved antidepressant  paxil paroxetine by gsk  in a phase iii trial 
while the precise mechanism for the effect of drugs like tasimelteon  agomelatine and rozerem  which act on the brain s melatonin receptors  is currently unknown  it is possible that  by improving sleep  these drugs could improve mood  since depressed patients are likely to have sleep disorders 
it is also possible that mood disorders such as depression have an association with circadian rhythm misalignments 
we believe that tasimelteon will be differentiated from approved antidepressants in several ways 
in the phase iii trial of agomelatine described above  agomelatine showed significantly improved mood in two weeks  versus four weeks for paxil 
consequently  tasimelteon may  with its similar properties to agomelatine  offer a more rapid onset of action than approved antidepressants 
we believe that tasimelteon should also have an improved side effect profile when compared to approved products because we believe that it should not have the sexual side effects  weight gain  and sleep disruption associated with these products 
we initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial magellan to study the efficacy of tasimelteon for the treatment of mdd in the third quarter of the clinical trial is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study with planned enrollment of approximately patients with mdd 
the trial has an eight week treatment period  followed by an optional one year open label extension  and includes measures of depression and anxiety symptoms and nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as laboratory measures of the internal body clock 
intellectual property tasimelteon and its formulations  genetic markers and uses are covered by a total of five patent and patent application families worldwide 
the primary new chemical entity patent covering tasimelteon expires normally in in the us and in most european markets 
we believe that  like fanapt  tasimelteon will meet the various criteria of the hatch waxman act and will receive five additional years of patent protection in the us  which would extend its patent protection in the us until in europe  data exclusivity will protect tasimelteon for at least ten years from approval 
additional patent applications directed to specific sleep disorders and to methods of administration  if issued  would provide exclusivity for such indications and methods of administration until at least our rights to the new chemical entity patent covering tasimelteon and related intellectual property have been acquired through a license with bristol myers squibb company bms 
please see license agreements below for a discussion of this license 
license agreements our rights to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates are subject to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by other pharmaceutical companies 
fanapt we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to patents and patent applications for fanapt through a sublicense agreement with novartis 
a predecessor company of sanofi aventis  hoechst marion roussel  inc hmri  discovered fanapt and completed early clinical work on the compound 
in  following a review of its product portfolio  hmri licensed its rights to the fanapt patents and patent applications to titan pharmaceuticals  inc titan on an exclusive basis 
in  soon after it had acquired its rights  titan sublicensed its rights to fanapt on an exclusive basis to novartis 
in june  we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to these patents and patent applications as well as certain novartis patents and patent applications to develop and commercialize fanapt through a sublicense agreement with novartis 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis which amended and restated our june sublicense agreement with novartis relating to fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt in the us and canada 
novartis began selling fanapt in the us during the first quarter of novartis is responsible for the further clinical development activities in the us and canada  including the development of a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada 
we also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
in addition  we are no longer required to make any future milestone payments with respect to sales of fanapt or any future royalty payments with respect to sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt outside of the us and canada 
we may lose our rights to develop and commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada if we fail to comply with certain requirements in the amended and restated sublicense agreement regarding our financial condition  or if we fail to comply with certain diligence obligations regarding our development or commercialization activities or if we otherwise breach the amended and restated sublicense agreement and fail to cure such breach 
our rights to develop and commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada may be impaired if we do not cure breaches by novartis of similar obligations contained in its sublicense agreement with titan for fanapt 
in addition  if novartis breaches the amended and restated sublicense agreement with respect to its commercialization activities in the us or canada  we may terminate novartis commercialization rights in the applicable country and we would no longer receive royalty payments from novartis in connection with such country in the event of such termination 
tasimelteon in february  we entered into a license agreement with bms under which we received an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications  and other licenses to intellectual property  to develop and commercialize tasimelteon 
in partial consideration for the license  we paid bms an initial license fee of million 
we are also obligated to make future milestone payments to bms of less than million in the aggregate the majority of which are tied to sales milestones as well as royalty payments based on the net sales of tasimelteon at a rate which  as a percentage of net sales  is in the low teens 
we made a milestone payment to bms of million under this license agreement in relating to the initiation of our first phase iii clinical trial for tasimelteon 
we are also obligated under this agreement to pay bms a percentage of any sublicense fees  upfront payments and milestone and other payments excluding royalties that we receive from a third party in connection with any sublicensing arrangement  at a rate which is in the mid twenties 
we have agreed with bms in our license agreement for tasimelteon to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tasimelteon and to meet certain milestones in initiating and completing certain clinical work 
the license agreement with bms was amended on april  to  among other things  extend the deadline by which we must enter into a development and commercialization agreement with a third party for tasimelteon until the earliest of i the date mutually agreed upon by bms and us following the provision by us to bms of a full written report of the phase iii clinical studies on which we intend to rely for filing for marketing authorization for tasimelteon in its first major market country phase iii report  ii the date of the acceptance by a regulatory authority of the filing by us for marketing authorization for tasimelteon in a major market country following the provision by us to bms of the phase iii report  or iii may  if we have not entered into a development and commercialization agreement with respect to certain major market countries by the foregoing deadline  then bms will have the option to exclusively develop and commercialize tasimelteon on its own in those countries not covered by such an agreement on pre determined financial terms  including milestone and royalty payments 
in addition to the foregoing  pursuant to the april  amendment  our deadline for filing a nda with the fda for tasimelteon was extended until june  either party may terminate the tasimelteon license agreement under certain circumstances  including a material breach of the agreement by the other 
in the event that bms has not exercised its option to reacquire the rights to tasimelteon and we terminate our license  or if bms terminates our license due to our breach  all rights licensed and developed by us under this agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to bms on an exclusive basis 
government regulation government authorities in the us  at the federal  state and local level  as well as foreign countries and local foreign governments  regulate the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution  sampling  marketing  import and export of our products 
other than fanapt in the us  all of our compounds will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous pre clinical and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the fda and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate domestic and foreign laws  rules and regulations require the expenditure of significant time and human and financial resources 
united states government regulation fda approval process in the us  the fda regulates drugs under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and implements regulations 
if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process  approval process  or after approval  we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions 
these sanctions could include the fda s refusal to approve pending applications  withdrawals of approvals  clinical holds  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of our operations  injunctions  fines  civil penalties or criminal prosecution 
any such sanction could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the steps required before a drug may be marketed in the us include pre clinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies under current good laboratory practices cglp submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin execution of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication for which approval is sought submission to the fda of an nda satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp fda review and approval of the nda pre clinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and activity of a drug 
violation of the fda s cglp regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of the studies  requiring these studies to be replicated 
in the us  drug developers submit the results of pre clinical trials  together with manufacturing information and analytical and stability data  to the fda as part of the ind  which must become effective before clinical trials can begin in the us an ind becomes effective days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions about issues such as the proposed clinical trials outlined in the ind 
in that case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding fda concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed 
if these concerns or questions are unresolved  the fda may not allow the clinical trials to commence 
pilot studies generally are conducted in a limited patient population  approximately three to subjects  to determine whether the drug warrants further clinical trials based on preliminary indications of efficacy 
these pilot studies may be performed in the us after an ind has become effective or outside of the us prior to the filing of an ind in the us in accordance with government regulations and institutional procedures 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the effectiveness of the drug 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind prior to beginning the trial 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase sequential process  but the phases may overlap 
each trial must be reviewed  approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board  and each trial must include the patient s informed consent 
phase i refers typically to closely monitored clinical trials and includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into human patients or health volunteer subjects 
phase i trials are designed to determine the safety  metabolism and pharmacologic actions of a drug in humans  the potential side effects associated with increasing drug doses and  if possible  to gain early evidence of the drug s effectiveness 
phase i trials also include the study of structure activity relationships and mechanism of action in humans  as well as studies in which investigational new drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes 
during phase i trials  sufficient information about a drug s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well controlled  scientifically valid phase ii studies 
the total number of subjects and patients included in phase i trials varies  but is generally in the range of to people 
phase ii refers to controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate appropriate dosage and the effectiveness of a drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with a disease or condition under study and to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the drug 
these trials are typically well controlled  closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients  usually involving no more than several hundred subjects 
phase iii refers to expanded controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials 
these trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of a drug has been obtained 
phase iii trials are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 
phase iii trials usually include several hundred to several thousand subjects 
phase i  ii and iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the us and may  at its discretion  reevaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
a clinical program is designed after assessing the causes of the disease  the mechanism of action of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug and all clinical and pre clinical data of previous trials performed 
typically  the trial design protocols and efficacy endpoints are established in consultation with the fda 
upon request through a special protocol assessment  the fda can also provide specific guidance on the acceptability of protocol design for clinical trials 
the fda  we or our partners may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to drug approval 
during all clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine effectiveness and to observe and report any reactions or other safety risks that may result from use of the drug 
assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials  drug developers submit the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  together with other detailed information including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug  to the fda  in the form of an nda  requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications 
in most cases  the nda must be accompanied by a substantial user fee 
the fda reviews an nda to determine  among other things  whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use 
before approving an nda  the fda will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug is manufactured 
the fda will not approve the application unless cgmp compliance is satisfactory 
the fda will issue an approval letter if it determines that the application  manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities are acceptable 
if the fda determines that the nda  manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable  it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often request additional testing or information 
notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the nda by issuing a not approvable letter which is not subsequently withdrawn or reversed by the fda 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and each may take several years to complete 
the fda may not grant approval on a timely basis  or at all 
we or our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals  which could delay or preclude us or our partners from marketing our products or partnered products or product candidates 
furthermore  the fda may prevent a drug developer from marketing a drug under a label for its desired indications or place other conditions on distribution as a condition of any approvals  which may impair commercialization of the drug 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved drug  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
similar regulatory procedures must also be complied within countries outside the us if the fda approves the nda  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the us after approval of our products or partnered products or product candidates  we have to comply with a number of post approval requirements  including delivering periodic reports to the fda  submitting descriptions of any adverse reactions reported  and complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements 
we and our partners also are required to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling 
also  our quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda to assess compliance with cgmp which imposes certain procedural and documentation requirements relating to quality assurance and quality control 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cgmp and other aspects of regulatory compliance 
the fda may require post market testing and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy  including additional studies  known as phase iv trials  to evaluate long term effects 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  we or our partners may have to conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved product for treatment of new indications  which require fda approval 
the purpose of these trials and studies is to broaden the application and use of the product or partnered product and its acceptance in the medical community 
we use  and will continue to use  third party manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates in clinical and commercial quantities 
future fda inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
in addition  discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product  manufacturer or holder of an approved nda  including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or fda initiated action that could delay further marketing 
newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product s approved labeling  including the addition of new warnings and contraindications 
on september   the food and drug administration amendments act  or the fdaaa  was enacted into law  amending both the fdc act and the public health service act 
the fdaaa makes a number of substantive and incremental changes to the review and approval processes in ways that could make it more difficult or costly to obtain approval for new pharmaceutical products  or to produce  market and distribute existing pharmaceutical products 
most significantly  the law changes the fda s handling of postmarked drug product safety issues by giving the fda authority to require post approval studies or clinical trials  to request that safety information be provided in labeling  or to require an nda applicant to submit and execute a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems 
the fdaaa also reauthorized the authority of the fda to collect user fees to fund the fda s review activities and made certain changes to the user fee provisions to permit the use of user fee revenue to fund the fda s drug product safety activities and the review of direct to consumer advertisements 
in addition  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products and product candidates under development 
the hatch waxman act in seeking approval for a drug through an nda  applicants are required to list with the fda each patent with claims that cover the applicant s drug 
upon approval of a drug  each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  commonly known as the orange book 
drugs listed in the orange book can  in turn be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application  or anda 
an anda provides for marketing of a drug that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug 
anda applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug  other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing 
drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug  and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug 
the anda applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved drug in the fda s orange book 
specifically  the applicant must certify that i the required patent information has not been filed  ii the listed patent has expired  iii the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration  or iv the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new drug 
a certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph iv certification 
if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents  the anda application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired 
if the anda applicant has provided a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda and patent holders once the anda has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of the receipt of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda until the earlier of months  expiration of the patent  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the anda applicant 
the anda application also will not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced drug has expired 
federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients  during which andas for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph iv challenge to a listed patent  in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval 
federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form  route of administration or combination  or for a new use  the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor  during which fda cannot grant effective approval of an anda based on that listed drug 
foreign regulation whether or not we or our partners obtain fda approval for a product or product candidate  we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product or product candidate in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country 
although governed by the applicable country  clinical trials conducted outside of the us typically are administered with the three phase sequential process that is discussed above under united states government regulation 
however  the foreign equivalent of an ind is not a prerequisite to performing pilot studies or phase i clinical trials 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is available for drugs produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
this authorization is a marketing authorization approval 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
this procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the us we face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our partners 
third party reimbursement and pricing controls in the us and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it will be time consuming and expensive for us or our partners to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payors 
our compounds may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us or our partners to sell our compounds on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs which may affect the marketing of our compounds 
in many foreign markets  including the countries in the european union and japan  pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the us  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
marketing and sales on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis pursuant to which novartis has exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt in the us and canada 
novartis began selling fanapt in the us during the first quarter of novartis is responsible for the further clinical development activities in the us and canada  including the development of a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and will be eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada 
we receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt outside of the us and canada 
novartis has chosen not to co commercialize fanapt in europe and certain other countries and will instead receive a royalty on net sales in those countries 
these include  but are not limited to  the countries in the european union  as well as switzerland  norway  liechtenstein and iceland 
we continue to explore the regulatory path and commercial opportunity for fanapt oral formulation outside of the us and canada 
on july   the ema notified us that it had accepted for evaluation the maa for oral iloperidone tablets 
we have received the initial list of comments from the ema and have been granted a three month extension of the review cycle in order to better prepare our responses to these comments 
we have entered into agreements with the following partners for the commercialization of fanapt in the countries set forth below country partner mexico probiomed sa de sa argentina biotoscana farma sa israel megapharm ltd 
in addition  given the range of potential indications for tasimelteon  we may pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of tasimelteon worldwide 
patents and proprietary rights  hatch waxman protection we and our partners will be able to protect our compounds from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our compounds are covered by valid and enforceable patents  either licensed in from third parties or generated internally  that give us or our partners sufficient proprietary rights 
accordingly  patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business 
fanapt and tasimelteon are covered by new chemical entity and other patents 
these patents cover the active pharmaceutical ingredient and provide patent protection for all formulations containing these active pharmaceutical ingredients 
the new chemical entity patent for fanapt is owned by sanofi aventis  and other patents and patent applications relating to fanapt are owned by novartis 
bms owns the new chemical entity patent for tasimelteon 
we originally obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the compounds covered by these patents through license and sublicense arrangements 
however  pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  novartis obtained exclusive commercialization rights to all formulations of fanapt in the us and canada 
for more on these license and sublicense arrangements  please see license agreements above 
in addition  we have generated intellectual property  and filed patent applications covering this intellectual property  for each of these compounds 
the new chemical entity patent covering fanapt expired normally in in the us and expired in in major markets outside of the us the new chemical entity patent covering tasimelteon expires in in the us and most european markets 
additionally  fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term extension and so the term of the new chemical entity patent in the us has been extended until november a similar extension is expected for tasimelteon 
fanapt will also be eligible for months of additional protection for successfully completing studies in the pediatric population potentially extending the term of the new chemical entity parent in the us until may these studies  for which novartis is responsible  are required by the fda approval letter 
in europe  statutes provide for ten years of data exclusivity  with the potential for an additional year if the company develops the drug for a significant new indication 
no generic versions of fanapt would be permitted to be marketed or sold during this year or year period in most european countries 
consequently  assuming that pediatric exclusivity is granted by the fda and that we receive regulatory approval in europe  we expect that novartis rights to commercialize fanapt will be exclusive until may in the us and for at least years from approval in europe 
the patent for the microsphere long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt expires in in the us and in most of the major markets in europe 
the pending patent application for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in the us the patent for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in most of the major markets in europe 
several other patent applications covering metabolites  uses  formulations and genetic markers relating to fanapt extend beyond aside from the new chemical entity patents and other in licensed patents relating to fanapt and tasimelteon  as of december  we had pending us patent applications  most of which have also been filed in key markets outside the us  relating to fanapt and tasimelteon 
in addition  we had four other patent applications directed to compounds not presently in clinical studies 
the claims in these various patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter  including claims covering other product candidates  pharmaceutical compositions  genetic markers  and methods of use 
for proprietary know how that is not appropriate for patent protection  processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our discovery process that involve proprietary know how and technology that is not covered by patent applications  we generally rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests 
we require all of our employees  consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements 
where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties  our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties 
manufacturing we currently depend on  and expect to continue to depend on  a small number of third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our products and product candidates for use in our clinical studies 
we are not obligated to obtain our products and product candidates from any particular third party manufacturer and we believe that we would be able to obtain our products and product candidates from a number of third party manufacturers at comparable cost 
if any of our products or product candidates are approved for commercial use in the future  we plan to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities for large scale commercialization 
if we do enter into commercial manufacturing arrangements with third parties  these third party manufacturers will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
specifically  regulatory authorities in the markets which we intend to serve will require that drugs be manufactured  packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmp or equivalent foreign standards 
we intend to engage only those contract manufacturers who have the capability to manufacture drugs in compliance with cgmp and other applicable standards in bulk quantities for commercial use 
competition the pharmaceutical industry and the central nervous system segment of that industry  in particular  is highly competitive and includes a number of established large and mid sized companies with greater financial  technical and personnel resources than we have and significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have 
our market segment also includes several smaller emerging companies whose activities are directly focused on our target markets and areas of expertise 
our current or future partnered products and if approved in the future  our other compounds  will compete with numerous therapeutic treatments offered by these competitors 
while we believe that our compounds will have certain favorable features  existing and new treatments may also possess advantages 
additionally  the development of other drug technologies and methods of disease prevention are occurring at a rapid pace 
these developments may render our compounds or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we believe the primary competitors for fanapt and tasimelteon are as follows for fanapt in the treatment of schizophrenia  the atypical antipsychotics risperdal risperidone  including the depot formulation risperdal consta  and invega paliperidone  including the depot formulation invega sustenna  each by ortho mcneil janssen pharmaceuticals  inc  zyprexa olanzapine  including the depot formulation zyprexa relprevv  by eli lilly and company  seroquel quetiapine by astrazeneca plc  abilify aripiprazole by bms otsuka pharmaceutical co  ltd  geodon ziprasidone by pfizer inc  saphris asenapine by schering plough  latuda lurasidone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  and generic clozapine  as well as the typical antipsychotics haloperidol  chlorpromazine  thioridazine  and sulpiride all of which are generic 
for tasimelteon in the treatment of insomnia  rozerem ramelteon by takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  hypnotics such as ambien zolpidem by sanofi aventis including ambien cr  lunesta eszopiclone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  sonata zaleplon by pfizer inc  silenor doxepin by somaxon pharmaceuticals  inc  generic compounds such as zolpidem  trazodone and doxepin  and over the counter remedies such as benadryl and tylenol pm 
for tasimelteon in the treatment of depression  antidepressants such as paxil paroxetine by glaxosmithkline gsk  zoloft sertraline by pfizer  prozac fluoxetine by eli lilly  lexapro escitalopram by lundbeck a s forest pharmaceuticals inc  effexor venlafaxine by pfizer inc  pristiq desvenlafaxine by pfizer  as well as other compounds such as wellbutrin buproprion by gsk  cymbalta duloxetine by eli lilly  viibryd vilazodone hcl by forest laboratories  inc and valdoxan agomelatine by les laboratories servier 
our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our ability to utilize our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics and drug development expertise to identify  develop  secure rights to and obtain regulatory approvals for promising pharmaceutical compounds before others are able to develop competitive products 
our ability to compete successfully will also depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
additionally  our ability to compete may be affected because insurers and other third party payors in some cases seek to encourage the use of cheaper  generic products  which could make our compounds less attractive 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were primarily engaged in research and development activities 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business and industry novartis began selling  marketing and distributing our first approved product  fanapt  in the us in the first quarter of and we will depend heavily on the success of this product in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue for the next few years will depend substantially on the success of fanapt and the sales of this product by novartis in the us and canada 
the ability of fanapt to generate revenue at the levels we expect will depend on many factors  including the following the ability of patients to be able to afford fanapt or obtain health care coverage that covers fanapt in the current uncertain economic climate acceptance of  and ongoing satisfaction  with fanapt by the medical community  patients receiving therapy and third party payers a satisfactory efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in a broad patient population the size of the market for fanapt successfully expanding and sustaining manufacturing capacity to meet demand cost and availability of raw materials the extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support fanapt receives safety concerns in the marketplace for schizophrenia therapies regulatory developments relating to the manufacture or continued use of fanapt decisions as to the timing of product launches  pricing and discounts the competitive landscape for approved and developing therapies that will compete with fanapt the amount of resources and efforts utilized by novartis in relation to the commercialization of fanapt novartis ability to successfully develop and commercialize a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt in the us and canada novartis ability to expand the indications for which fanapt can be marketed in the us novartis ability to obtain regulatory approval in canada for fanapt and our or our partners ability to obtain regulatory approval for fanapt in countries outside the us and canada our ability to successfully develop and commercialize fanapt  including a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt  outside of the us and canada the unfavorable outcome or other negative effects of any potential litigation relating to fanapt we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis to commercialize fanapt in the us and canada and to further develop and commercialize a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt in the us and canada 
as such  we will not be directly involved in the marketing or sales efforts for fanapt in the us and canada 
our future revenues depend substantially on royalties and milestone payments we may receive from novartis 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we received an upfront payment of million and are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon novartis achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada  which may or may not be achieved or met 
we also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
such royalties may not be significant and will depend on numerous factors 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that novartis may devote to fanapt or the depot formulation of fanapt 
if novartis fails to successfully commercialize fanapt in the us  fails to develop and commercialize fanapt in canada or further develop a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt  if novartis efforts are not effective  or if novartis focuses its efforts on other schizophrenia therapies or schizophrenia drug candidates  our business will be negatively affected 
if novartis does not successfully commercialize fanapt in the us or canada  we will receive limited revenues from them 
although we have developed and continue to develop additional products and product candidates for commercial introduction  we expect to be substantially dependent on sales from fanapt for the foreseeable future 
for reasons outside of our control  including those mentioned above  sales of fanapt may not meet our or financial or industry analysts expectations 
any significant negative developments relating to fanapt  such as safety or efficacy issues  the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products or adverse regulatory or legislative developments  will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if our compounds are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans  whether commercially or in clinical trials  our business will be materially harmed 
despite the fda s approval of the nda for fanapt in may and the positive results of our completed trials for fanapt and tasimelteon  we are uncertain whether either of these products will ultimately prove to be effective and safe in humans 
frequently  products that have shown promising results in clinical trials have suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials or even after they are approved for commercial sale 
future uses of our compounds  whether in clinical trials or commercially  may reveal that the product is ineffective  unacceptably toxic  has other undesirable side effects  is difficult to manufacture on a large scale  is uneconomical  infringes on proprietary rights of another party or is otherwise not fit for further use 
if our compounds are determined to be unsafe or ineffective in humans  our business will be materially harmed 
clinical trials for our compounds are expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our compounds could severely harm our business 
pre clinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our compounds are time consuming and expensive and together take several years to complete 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our compounds  we or our partners must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that such compound is safe and effective for use in humans 
we have incurred  and we will continue to incur  substantial expense for  and devote a significant amount of time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often have not predicted results of later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
clinical trials conducted by us  by our partners or by third parties on our or our partners behalf may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our compounds 
regulatory authorities may not permit us or our partners to undertake any additional clinical trials for our compounds  may force us to stop any ongoing clinical trials and it may be difficult to design efficacy studies for our compounds in new indications 
clinical development efforts performed by us or our partners may not be successfully completed 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time can vary substantially with the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the compounds and the size of the prospective patient population 
the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials for our compounds may be delayed by many factors  including the inability to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in pre clinical studies and clinical trials delays in beginning a clinical trial delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data poor effectiveness of our compounds during clinical trials unforeseen safety issues or side effects and governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines if we or our partners fail to complete successfully one or more clinical trials for our compounds  we or they may not receive the regulatory approvals needed to market that compound 
therefore  any failure or delay in commencing or completing these clinical trials would harm our business materially 
we and our partners face heavy government regulation 
fda regulatory approval of our compounds is uncertain and we and our partners are also continually at risk of the fda requiring us or them to discontinue marketing any compounds that have obtained  or in the future may obtain  regulatory approval 
the research  testing  manufacturing and marketing of compounds such as those that we have developed or we or in regard to partnered products  our partners  are developing are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local government authorities  including the fda 
to obtain regulatory approval of such compounds  we or our partners must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory agency that  among other things  the compound is safe and effective for its intended use 
in addition  we or our partners must show that the manufacturing facilities used to produce such compounds are in compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations or cgmp 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals and clearances can take many years and will require us and  in the case of partnered products  our partners to expend substantial time and capital 
despite the time and expense expended  regulatory approval is never guaranteed 
the number of pre clinical and clinical trials that will be required for fda approval varies depending on the compound  the disease or condition that the compound is in development for  and the requirements applicable to that particular compound 
the fda can delay  limit or deny approval of a compound for many reasons  including that a compound may not be shown to be safe or effective the fda may interpret data from pre clinical and clinical trials in different ways than we or our partners do the fda may not approve our or our partners manufacturing processes or facilities a compound may not be approved for all the indications we or our partners request the fda may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations the fda may not meet  or may extend  the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date with respect to a particular nda and the fda may not agree with our or our partners regulatory approval strategies or components of the regulatory filings  such as clinical trial designs for example  if certain of our or our partners methods for analyzing trial data are not accepted by the fda  we or our partners may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our compounds 
moreover  the marketing  distribution and manufacture of approved products remain subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in  among other things warning letters fines civil penalties injunctions recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant future approvals withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our compounds will result in increased costs  could diminish competitive advantages that we may attain and would adversely affect the marketing and sale of our compounds 
other than fanapt in the us  which is being marketed and sold by novartis  we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our compounds in any jurisdiction 
even following regulatory approval of our compounds  the fda may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which such compounds may be marketed  subsequently withdraw approval or take other actions against us  our partners or such compounds that are adverse to our business 
the fda generally approves drugs for particular indications 
an approval for a more limited indication reduces the size of the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn or modified if problems occur after initial marketing 
we and our partners also are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the environment and the use and disposal of hazardous substances used in connection with discovery  research and development work 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent to which new governmental regulations might significantly impede the discovery  development  production and marketing of our compounds 
we or our partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations  and we may be adversely affected by the cost of such compliance or the inability to comply with such laws or regulations 
we intend to seek regulatory approvals for our compounds in foreign jurisdictions  but we may not obtain any such approvals 
pursuant to our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we retained the right to develop and commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada 
we intend to market our compounds outside the us and canada with one or more commercial partners 
in order to market our compounds in foreign jurisdictions  we or our partners may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals and to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements 
the approval procedure varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional trials  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
additionally  the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval 
for all of these reasons  we or our partners may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the fda 
we or our partners may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our compounds in any market 
the failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business materially 
our compounds may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay  prevent or result in the revocation of their regulatory approval or limit their marketability 
undesirable side effects caused by our compounds could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the fda or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications  and in turn prevent us or our partners from commercializing or continuing the commercialization of such compounds and generating revenues from their sale 
we and our partners  as applicable  will continue to assess the side effect profile of our compounds in ongoing clinical development programs 
however  we cannot predict whether the commercial use of our approved compounds or our compounds in development  if and when they are approved for commercial use will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in the use of  or in clinical trials conducted for  such compounds to date 
additionally  incidents of product misuse may occur 
these events  among others  could result in product recalls  product liability actions or withdrawals or additional regulatory controls  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if after receiving marketing approval of a compound  we  our partners or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such compound  we or our partners could face one or more of the following regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as a black box warning or a contraindication regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the compound we or our partners may be required to change the way the compound is administered  conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the compound and our  our partner s or the compound s reputation may suffer any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected compound or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the compound  which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale 
even after we or our partners obtain regulatory approvals of a product  acceptance of such compound in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate revenues 
even after obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of our compounds  the commercial success of these compounds will depend  among other things  on their acceptance by physicians  patients  third party payors and other members of the medical community as a therapeutic and cost effective alternative to competing products and treatments 
the degree of market acceptance of any compound will depend on a number of factors  including the demonstration of its safety and efficacy  its cost effectiveness  its potential advantages over other therapies  the reimbursement policies of government and third party payors with respect to such compound  our ability to attract and maintain corporate partners  including pharmaceutical companies  to assist in commercializing our compounds  receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we or our partners are developing and the effectiveness of our and our partners marketing and distribution capabilities 
if our approved compounds fail to gain market acceptance  we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business 
if our approved compounds do not become widely accepted by physicians  patients  third party payors and other members of the medical community  it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable on a sustained basis or achieve significant revenues 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our research and development activities and commercialization efforts  we may be unable to continue operations or we may be forced to share our rights to commercialize our products and product candidates with third parties on terms that may not be attractive to us 
our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital throughout and beyond 
as of december   our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million 
our long term capital requirements are expected to depend on many factors  including  among others the amount of royalty and milestone payments received from our commercial partners our ability to commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada costs of developing and maintaining sales  marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our products the number of potential formulations  products and product candidates in development progress with pre clinical studies and clinical trials time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory including fda clearance costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent  trademark and other intellectual property claims competing technological and market developments market acceptance of our products costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants costs for training physicians and legal  accounting  insurance and other professional and business related costs we expect to continue to receive royalty payments and hope to receive milestone payments relating to fanapt in connection with our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis 
however  if fanapt is not as commercially successful as we expect and we do not receive such payments  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our anticipated operating expenses and execute on our business plans 
in our capital raising efforts  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or obtain a bank credit facility  or enter into partnerships or other collaboration agreements 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  if convertible  could result in dilution to our stockholders and may also result in a lower price for our common stock 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that could restrict our operations 
however  we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our planned activities  we may not be able to continue operations  or we may have to enter into partnerships or other collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than is currently intended 
these partnerships or collaborations  if consummated prior to proof of efficacy or safety of a given product  could impair our ability to realize value from that product 
if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our operations and planned growth  develop or enhance our technologies or products  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures  any of which would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a history of operating losses  anticipate future losses and may never become profitable on a sustained basis 
we have been engaged in identifying and developing compounds since march  which has required  and will continue to require  significant research and development expenditures 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses of million  and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses 
our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability largely depends on novartis and our ability to sell fanapt 
although novartis launched fanapt in the us in the first quarter of and sales to date have not met our expectations  it is too early to determine whether or not fanapt will be a commercial success over time 
fanapt may continue to not be as commercially successful as we expected  novartis may not succeed in gaining additional market acceptance of fanapt in the us or developing and commercializing fanapt in canada  and we may not succeed in commercializing fanapt outside of the us and canada 
in addition  we may not succeed in commercializing any other compounds 
tasimelteon is presently in development for nhd and mdd and will require significant resources prior to market approval 
we may not be profitable even if our compounds are successfully commercialized 
we may be unable to fully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  commercialize  manufacture  market  sell and derive revenue from our compounds in the timeframes we project  if at all  and our inability to do so would materially and adversely impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve sustained profitability 
our ability to achieve sustained profitability in the future depends  in part  upon our and our partners ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our compounds  both in the us and in foreign countries novartis ability to successfully market and sell fanapt in the us and canada and achieve certain product development and sales milestones our and our partners ability to successfully commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada our ability to enter into and maintain agreements to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates our and our partners ability to develop  have manufactured and market our products and product candidates our and our partners ability to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage for our compounds from insurance companies  government programs and other third party payors our ability to obtain additional research and development funding from collaborative partners or funding for our products and product candidates in addition  the amount we spend will impact our profitability 
our spending will depend  in part  upon the progress of our research and development programs for our products and product candidates  including clinical trials the time and expense that will be required to pursue fda and or foreign regulatory approvals for our compounds and whether such approvals are obtained on a timely basis  if at all the time and expense required to prosecute  enforce and or challenge patent and other intellectual property rights the cost of operating and maintaining development and research facilities the cost of third party manufacturers the number of product candidates we pursue how competing technological and market developments affect our compounds the cost of possible acquisitions of technologies  compounds  product rights or companies the cost of obtaining licenses to use technology owned by others for proprietary products and otherwise the costs and effect of potential litigation and the costs associated with recruiting and compensating a highly skilled workforce in an environment where competition for such employees may be intense we may not achieve all or any of these goals and  thus  we cannot provide assurances that we will ever be profitable on a sustained basis or achieve significant revenues 
even if we do achieve some or all of these goals  we may not achieve significant or sustained commercial success 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of transactions involving our common stock 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating losses  or nols  and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income 
in general  an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than percentage points over such stockholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 
transactions involving our common stock  even those outside our control  such as purchases or sales by investors  within the testing period could result in an ownership change 
a limitation on our ability to utilize some or all of our nols could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
if our contract research organizations do not successfully carry out their duties or if we lose our relationships with contract research organizations  our drug development efforts could be delayed 
our arrangements with contract research organizations are critical to our success in bringing our products and product candidates to the market and promoting such marketed products profitably 
we are dependent on contract research organizations  third party vendors and investigators for pre clinical testing and clinical trials related to our drug discovery and development efforts and we will likely continue to depend on them to assist in our future discovery and development efforts 
these parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
as such  they may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols 
the parties with which we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data 
if they fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs or if their performance is substandard  it will delay the development  approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates 
moreover  these parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
if they assist our competitors  it could harm our competitive position 
our contract research organizations could merge with or be acquired by other companies or experience financial or other setbacks unrelated to our collaboration that could  nevertheless  materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties  we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services 
we may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms  if at all 
even if we locate an alternative provider  it is likely that this provider may need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider 
in addition  any provider that we retain will be subject to current good laboratory practices or cglp  and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers 
consequently  if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers  the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates could be delayed 
we rely on a limited number of third party manufacturers to formulate and manufacture our products and product candidates and our business will be seriously harmed if these manufacturers are not able to satisfy our demand and alternative sources are not available 
our expertise is primarily in the research and development and pre clinical and clinical trial phases of product development 
we do not have an in house manufacturing capability and depend completely on a small number of third party manufacturers and active pharmaceutical ingredient formulators for the manufacture of our products and product candidates 
therefore  we are dependent on third parties for our formulation development and manufacturing of our products and product candidates 
this may expose us to the risk of not being able to directly oversee the production and quality of the manufacturing process and provide ample commercial supplies to successfully launch and maintain the marketing of our products and product candidates 
furthermore  these third party contractors  whether foreign or domestic  may experience regulatory compliance difficulty  mechanical shut downs  employee strikes  or other unforeseeable events that may delay or limit production 
our inability to adequately establish  supervise and conduct either ourselves or through third parties all aspects of the formulation and manufacturing processes would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these third parties  and if they are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason  we may not be able to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them 
any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates in a timely manner from these third parties could adversely affect sales of our products  delay clinical trials and prevent us from developing our products and product candidates in a cost effective manner or on a timely basis 
in addition  manufacturers of our products and product candidates are subject to cgmp and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our manufacturers 
if one of our contract manufacturers fails to maintain compliance  the production of our products or product candidates could be interrupted  resulting in delays and additional costs 
in addition  if the facilities of such manufacturers do not pass a pre approval or post approval plant inspection  the fda will not grant approval and may institute restrictions on the marketing or sale of our products or product candidates 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following additional risks because most of our third party manufacturers and formulators are located outside of the us  there may be difficulties in importing our products and product candidates or their components into the us as a result of  among other things  fda import inspections  incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging because of the complex nature of our products and product candidates  our manufacturers may not be able to successfully manufacture our products and product candidates in a cost effective and or timely manner 
materials necessary to manufacture our compounds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  which may delay the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our compounds 
we and our partners rely on manufacturers to purchase from third party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our compounds for clinical trials and commercialization 
suppliers may not sell these materials to such manufacturers at the times we or our partners need them or on commercially reasonable terms 
we do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by these manufacturers 
moreover  we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials 
if the manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our or our partners clinical trials  product testing  potential regulatory approval of our compounds and commercial scale manufacturing could be delayed  significantly affecting our and our partners ability to further develop and commercialize our compounds 
if we  our manufacturers or  in the case of our partnered products  our partners are unable to purchase these materials for our products or partnered products  as applicable  there would be a shortage in supply or the commercial launch of such products or partnered products would be delayed  which would materially and adversely affect our or our partners ability to generate revenues from the sale of such products or partnered products 
we face substantial competition which may result in others developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do 
our future success will depend on our or our partners ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our compounds and our ability to identify and develop additional products or product candidates through the application of our pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
large  fully integrated pharmaceutical companies  either alone or together with collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products and product candidates undertaking pre clinical testing and clinical trials obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products and product candidates and manufacturing  marketing and selling products these companies may invest heavily and quickly to discover and develop novel products that could make our compounds obsolete 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing superior products or other competing products before we do 
technological developments or the fda or foreign regulatory approval of new therapeutic indications for existing products may make our compounds obsolete or may make them more difficult to market successfully  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fanapt and our other compounds  if successfully developed and approved for commercial sale will compete with a number of drugs and therapies currently manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
our compounds may also compete with new products currently under development by others or with products which may cost less than our compounds 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept or utilize any of our compounds that may be approved 
if fanapt and our other compounds  if and when approved do not achieve significant market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we believe the primary competitors for fanapt and tasimelteon are as follows for fanapt in the treatment of schizophrenia  the atypical antipsychotics risperdal risperidone  including the depot formulation risperdal consta  and invega paliperidone  including the depot formulation invega sustenna  each by ortho mcneil janssen pharmaceuticals  inc  zyprexa olanzapine  including the depot formulation zyprexa relprevv  by eli lilly and company  seroquel quetiapine by astrazeneca plc  abilify aripiprazole by bms otsuka pharmaceutical co  ltd  geodon ziprasidone by pfizer inc  saphris asenapine by schering plough  latuda lurasidone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  and generic clozapine  as well as the typical antipsychotics haloperidol  chlorpromazine  thioridazine  and sulpiride all of which are generic 
for tasimelteon in the treatment of insomnia  rozerem ramelteon by takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  hypnotics such as ambien zolpidem by sanofi aventis including ambien cr  lunesta eszopiclone by dainippon sumitomo pharma  sonata zaleplon by pfizer inc  silenor doxepin by somaxon pharmaceuticals  inc  generic compounds such as zolpidem  trazodone and doxepin  and over the counter remedies such as benadryl and tylenol pm 
for tasimelteon in the treatment of depression  antidepressants such as paxil paroxetine by glaxosmithkline gsk  zoloft sertraline by pfizer  prozac fluoxetine by eli lilly  lexapro escitalopram by lundbeck a s forest pharmaceuticals inc  effexor venlafaxine by pfizer inc  pristiq desvenlafaxine by pfizer  as well as other compounds such as wellbutrin buproprion by gsk  cymbalta duloxetine by eli lilly  viibryd vilazodone hcl by forest laboratories  inc and valdoxan agomelatine by les laboratories servier 
additionally  our ability to compete may be affected because insurers and other third party payors in some cases seek to encourage the use of cheaper  generic products  which could make our compounds less attractive 
we have no experience selling  marketing or distributing products  other than providing assistance to novartis relating to the us commercialization of fanapt  and no internal capability to do so  which may make commercializing our products and product candidates difficult 
at present  we have no marketing experience or sales capabilities  other than providing assistance to novartis relating to the us commercialization of fanapt 
therefore  in order for us to commercialize fanapt  outside the us and canada  or our other compounds  we must either acquire or internally develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these services for us 
we may  in some instances  rely significantly on sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with our collaborative partners and other third parties 
for example  we rely completely on novartis to market  sell and distribute fanapt in the us and canada and our future revenues are materially dependent on the success of the efforts of novartis 
for the commercialization of fanapt outside the us and canada or our other compounds  we may not be able to establish  other than those currently established  sales and distribution partnerships on acceptable terms or at all 
in regard to our current foreign partners and any additional distribution arrangements or other agreements we may enter into  our success will be materially dependent upon the performance of our partner 
in the event that we attempt to acquire or develop our own in house sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products and product candidates without partners or licensees include our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products the lack of complementary products to be offered by our sales personnel  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage against companies with broader product lines and unforeseen costs associated with creating our own sales and marketing team or with entering into a partnering agreement with an independent sales and marketing organization the cost of establishing and maintaining a sales  marketing and distribution organization may exceed its cost effectiveness 
if we fail to develop sales and marketing capabilities  if sales efforts are not effective or if costs of developing sales and marketing capabilities exceed their cost effectiveness  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot identify  or enter into licensing arrangements for  new products or product candidates  our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio will be limited 
a component of our business strategy is acquiring rights to develop and commercialize compounds discovered or developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for which we may find effective uses and markets through our unique pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise for the treatment of central nervous system disorders 
competition for the acquisition of these compounds is intense 
if we are not able to identify opportunities to acquire rights to commercialize additional products or product candidates  we may not be able to develop a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates and our business may be harmed 
additionally  it may take substantial human and financial resources to secure commercial rights to promising products or product candidates 
moreover  if other firms develop pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics capabilities  we may face increased competition in identifying and acquiring additional products or product candidates 
we may not be successful in the development of products for our own account 
in addition to our business strategy of acquiring rights to develop and commercialize products and product candidates  we may develop products and product candidates for our own account by applying our technologies to off patent drugs as well as developing our own proprietary molecules 
because we will be funding the development of such programs  there is a risk that we may not be able to continue to fund all such programs to completion or to provide the support necessary to perform the clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals or market any approved products 
we expect the development of products for our own account to consume substantial resources 
if we are able to develop commercial products on our own  the risks associated with these programs may be greater than those associated with our programs with collaborative partners 
if we lose key scientists or management personnel  or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel  it will impair our ability to identify  develop and commercialize products 
we are highly dependent on principal members of our management team and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  mihael h 
polymeropoulos  md these executives each have significant pharmaceutical industry experience 
the loss of any such executives  including dr 
polymeropoulos  or any other principal member of our management team or scientific staff  would impair our ability to identify  develop and market new products 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the loss of the services of these or other key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  could result in delays to development or approval  loss of sales and diversion of management resources 
in addition  we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel  including research scientists 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy 
we may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis  if at all  which would negatively impact our development and commercialization programs 
additionally  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees 
this lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals 
product liability lawsuits could divert our resources  result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our compounds 
the risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and sale of pharmaceutical products 
for example  we face a risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our products and product candidates in clinical trials and will face even greater risks upon commercialization by us or our partners of our compounds 
we believe that we may be at a greater risk of product liability claims relative to other pharmaceutical companies because our compounds are intended to treat central nervous system disorders  and it is possible that we may be held liable for the behavior and actions of patients who use our compounds 
these lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend 
in addition  if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits  we may incur substantial liabilities and we or our partners may be forced to limit or forego further commercialization of one or more of our compounds 
although we maintain product liability insurance  our aggregate coverage limit under this insurance is million  and while we believe this amount of insurance is sufficient to cover our product liability exposure  these limits may not be high enough to fully cover potential liabilities 
as our development activities and commercialization efforts progress and we and our partners sell our compounds  this coverage may be inadequate  we may be unable to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or we may be unable to get adequate coverage at all or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to a future claim 
this could prevent the commercialization or limit the commercial potential of our compounds 
even if we are able to maintain insurance that we believe is adequate  our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by a product liability claim 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of products liability litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
product liability litigation and other related proceedings may also require significant management time 
legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in the us and foreign jurisdictions may affect our or our partners ability to sell our products or partnered products profitably 
the continuing efforts of the us and foreign governments  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our or our partners ability to set prices for our products or partnered products which we or our partners believe are fair  and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability 
specifically  in both the us and some foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our or our partners ability to sell our products or partnered products profitably 
in the us  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of reformed the way medicare covered and provided reimbursement for pharmaceutical products 
this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we or our partners may receive for our products or partnered products 
other third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it will be time consuming and expensive for us or our partners to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payors 
our products or partnered products may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of such products on a competitive and profitable basis 
further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely which could limit the prices that can be charged for the drugs we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity 
our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the medicare prescription drug coverage legislation  by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other healthcare reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future 
the patient protection and affordable care act of  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  or ppaca  is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the us  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program  and the establishment of health care exchanges 
several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  may affect us  and will likely increase certain of our costs 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from to was effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs was expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations effective as of march  the ppaca also imposes an annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers which began in  based on the manufacturer s sale of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics excluding orphan drugs  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs including the creation of new penalties for non compliance  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or doughnut hole 
the law also revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes effective october   which could increase the amount of medicaid drug rebates to states 
substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added  which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners 
the reforms imposed by the new law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry  however  the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
moreover  in the coming years  additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates 
we will continue to evaluate the ppaca  as amended  the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies  as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact on our business over time 
these developments could  however  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some foreign countries  including major markets in the european union and japan  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in these countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take nine to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product to other available therapies 
our business could be materially harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels 
our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight and changes in laws could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight 
as a result  we may become subject to governmental actions which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  including new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to patent protection and enforcement  health care availability  method of delivery and payment for health care products and services or our business operations generally changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations in addition  the food and drug administration amendments act of or the fdaaa included new authorization for the fda to require post market safety monitoring  along with a clinical trials registry  and expanded authority for the fda to impose civil monetary penalties on companies that fail to meet certain commitments 
the amendments among other things  require some new drug applicants to submit risk evaluation and minimization strategies to monitor and address potential safety issues for products upon approval  grant the fda the authority to impose risk management measures for marketed products and to mandate labeling changes in certain circumstances  and establish new requirements for disclosing the results of clinical trials 
companies that violate the law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties 
additional measures have also been enacted to address the perceived shortcomings in the fda s handling of drug safety issues  and to limit pharmaceutical company sales and promotional practices 
while the fdaaa has had  and is expected to have  a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry  the full extent of that effect is not yet known 
as the fda issues regulations  guidance and interpretations relating to the new legislation  the impact on the industry as well as our business will become clearer 
the requirements and other changes that the fdaaa imposes may make it more difficult  and likely more costly  to obtain approval of new pharmaceutical products and to produce  market and distribute existing products 
our and our partners ability to commercialize approved products successfully may be hindered  and our business may be harmed as a result 
failure to comply with government regulations regarding the sale and marketing of our products or partnered products could harm our business 
our and our partners activities  including the sale and marketing of our products or partnered products  are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight  including regulation under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal and state statutes 
we are also subject to the provisions of the federal anti kickback statute and several similar state laws  which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare products or services 
while the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program  state laws may apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved 
these laws constrain the sales  marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of drugs and biologicals  such as us  by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements  including sales programs  with hospitals  physicians  and other potential purchasers of drugs and biologicals 
other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent  or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
anti kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial  including the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation  including claims asserting antitrust violations  violations of the federal false claim act  the anti kickback statute  the prescription drug marketing act and other violations in connection with off label promotion of products and medicare and or medicaid reimbursement or related to environmental matters and claims under state laws  including state anti kickback and fraud laws 
while we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements  interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing practices are ever evolving 
if any such actions are instituted against us or our partners and we or they are not successful in defending such actions or asserting our rights  those actions could have a significant and material adverse impact on our business  including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 
even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to  and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future transactions may harm our business or the market price of our stock 
we regularly review potential transactions related to technologies  products or product rights and businesses complementary to our business 
these transactions could include mergers acquisitions strategic alliances licensing agreements and co promotion and similar agreements we may choose to enter into one or more of these transactions at any time  which may cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our stock 
moreover  depending upon the nature of any transaction  we may experience a charge to earnings  which could also materially adversely affect our results of operations and could harm the market price of our stock 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future  and difficulties integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
although we have no experience in acquiring businesses  we may acquire businesses or assets that complement or augment our existing business 
if we acquire businesses with promising product candidates or technologies  we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to move one or more products or product candidates through preclinical and or clinical development to regulatory approval and commercialization 
integrating any newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time consuming  resulting in the diversion of resources from our current business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully 
we cannot assure you that  following an acquisition  we will achieve revenues  specific net income or loss levels that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings  or reduced losses  for the combined company in any future period 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses  which would result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness and may not be available on terms which would otherwise be acceptable to us 
we may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the revenues we generate  if any  and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors  including our addition or termination of development programs variations in the level of expenses related to our products  product candidates or future development programs our execution of collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements the timing and amount of royalties or milestone payments  if any  from the sales of fanapt regulatory developments affecting our compounds or those of our competitors product sales cost of product sales marketing and other expenses manufacturing or supply issues and any intellectual property infringement or other lawsuit in which we may become involved if our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
furthermore  any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may  in turn  cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
risks related to intellectual property and other legal matters our rights to develop and commercialize our product and product candidates are subject in part to the terms and conditions of licenses or sublicenses granted to us by other pharmaceutical companies 
with respect to tasimelteon  these terms and conditions include an option in favor of the licensor to reacquire rights to commercialize and develop this product in certain circumstances 
fanapt iloperidone is based in part on patents and other intellectual property owned by sanofi aventis and novartis 
titan pharmaceuticals  inc titan holds an exclusive license from sanofi aventis to the intellectual property owned by sanofi aventis  and titan has sublicensed its rights under such license on an exclusive basis to novartis 
we acquired exclusive rights to this and other intellectual property through a further sublicense from novartis 
the sublicense with novartis was amended and restated in october of to provide novartis with exclusive rights to commercialize fanapt in the us and canada and further develop and commercialize a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retained exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt outside of the us and canada 
novartis has chosen not to co commercialize fanapt in europe and certain other countries and will instead receive a royalty on net sales in those countries 
these include  but are not limited to  the countries in the european union  as well as switzerland  norway  liechtenstein and iceland 
we may lose our rights to develop and commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada if we fail to comply with certain requirements in the amended and restated sublicense agreement regarding our financial condition  or if we fail to comply with certain diligence obligations regarding our development or commercialization activities or if we otherwise breach the amended and restated sublicense agreement and fail to cure such breach 
our rights to develop and commercialize fanapt outside the us and canada may be impaired if we do not cure breaches by novartis of similar obligations contained in its sublicense agreement with titan 
our loss of rights in fanapt to novartis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if novartis breaches the amended and restated sublicense agreement with respect to its commercialization activities in the us or canada  we may terminate novartis commercialization rights in the applicable country 
we would no longer receive royalty payments from novartis in connection with such country in the event of such termination 
tasimelteon is based in part on patents that we have licensed on an exclusive basis and other intellectual property licensed from bristol myers squibb company bms 
bms holds certain rights with respect to tasimelteon in the license agreement 
if we have not agreed to one or more partnering arrangements to develop and commercialize tasimelteon in certain significant markets with one or more third parties by a certain date  bms has the option to exclusively develop and commercialize tasimelteon on its own on pre determined financial terms  including milestone and royalty payments 
bms may terminate our license if we fail to meet certain milestones or if we otherwise breach our royalty or other obligations in the agreement 
in the event that we terminate our license  or if bms terminates our license due to our breach  all of our rights to tasimelteon including any intellectual property we develop with respect to tasimelteon will revert back to bms or otherwise be licensed back to bms on an exclusive basis 
any termination or reversion of our rights to develop or commercialize tasimelteon  including any reacquisition by bms of our rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our compounds are not adequate  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets 
in addition to the rights we have licensed from novartis and bms relating to our compounds  we rely upon intellectual property we own relating to these compounds  including patents  patent applications and trade secrets 
as of december   excluding in licensed patents and patent applications  we had pending us patent applications  most of which have also been filed in key markets outside the us  and one pending patent cooperation treaty application  relating to fanapt and tasimelteon 
in addition  we had four other patent applications relating to compounds not presently in clinical studies 
our patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents 
in addition  we generally rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect certain proprietary know how that is not patentable  for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and for any other elements of our drug development processes that involve proprietary know how  information and technology that is not covered by patent applications 
while we require all of our employees  consultants  advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know how  information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements  we cannot be certain that this know how  information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us as a result  we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the us and abroad 
if we are unable to protect or defend the intellectual property related to our technologies  we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market 
if we do not obtain protection under the hatch waxman act and similar foreign legislation to extend our patents and to obtain market exclusivity for our products and partnered products  our business will be harmed 
the united states drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  more commonly known as the hatch waxman act  provides for an extension of patent term for drugs for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development 
assuming we gain a five year patent term restoration for tasimelteon  and that we continue to have rights under our license agreement with respect to this product  we would have exclusive rights to tasimelteon s us new chemical entity patent the primary patent covering the compound as a new composition of matter until on august   the us patent and trademark office issued a certificate of extension under the hatch waxman act  extending by five years the term of sanofi aventis new chemical entity patent relating to fanapt to november fanapt will also be eligible for months of additional protection for successfully completing studies in the pediatric population potentially extending the term of the new chemical entity parent in the us until may the patent for the microsphere long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt expires in in the us and in most of the major markets in europe 
the pending patent application for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in the us the patent for the aqueous microcrystals long acting injectible or depot formulation of fanapt will expire in in most of the major markets in europe 
a directive in the european union provides that companies that receive regulatory approval for a new compound will have a year period of market exclusivity for that compound with the possibility of a further one year extension in most countries in europe  beginning on the date of such european regulatory approval  regardless of when the european new chemical entity patent covering such compound expires 
a generic version of the approved drug may not be marketed or sold in europe during such market exclusivity period 
this directive is of material importance with respect to fanapt  since the european new chemical entity patent for fanapt has expired 
however  there is no assurance that we will receive the extensions of our patents or other exclusive rights available under the hatch waxman act or similar foreign legislation 
if we fail to receive such extensions and exclusive rights  our ability or our partners ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing  marketing and selling generic versions of our products or partnered products will be materially impaired 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to divert resources and may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts 
our commercial success depends in part on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
in addition  third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to develop and commercialize one or more of our products 
defense of these claims  regardless of their merit  would divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may have to pay substantial damages  obtain one or more licenses from third parties or pay royalties 
in addition  even in the absence of litigation  we may need to obtain additional licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our products 
we may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms  if at all 
in that event  we would be unable to develop and commercialize further one or more of our products 
in addition  in the future we could be required to initiate litigation to enforce our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties 
prosecution of these claims to enforce our rights against others could divert substantial financial and employee resources from our business 
if we fail to enforce our proprietary rights against others  our business will be harmed 
if we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law  we may be liable for damages 
our research  development and commercialization activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances  including toxic chemical and biological materials 
although our goal is for our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials to comply with state and federal standards  there will always be the risk of contamination  injury or other damages resulting from these hazardous substances 
if we were to become liable for an accident  or if we or our partners were to suffer an extended facility shutdown  we could incur significant costs  damages and penalties that could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our operations produce hazardous waste products 
while third parties are responsible for disposal of our hazardous waste  we could be liable under environmental laws for any required cleanup of sites at which our waste is disposed 
federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these hazardous materials 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations at any time  or if they change  we may be subject to criminal sanctions and substantial civil liabilities  which may adversely affect our business 
even if we continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding hazardous materials  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and our resultant liability for any injuries or other damages caused by these accidents 
although we maintain pollution liability insurance  our coverage limit under this insurance is million  and while we believe this amount and type of insurance is sufficient to cover risks typically associated with our handling of materials  the insurance may not cover all environmental liabilities  and these limits may not be high enough to cover potential liabilities for these damages fully 
the amount of uninsured liabilities may exceed our financial resources and materially harm our business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been highly volatile and may be volatile in the future  and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors or other unforeseen risks could have a dramatic and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
between december  and december   the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market varied between and 
additionally  market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including ours  have historically been very volatile 
the market for these securities has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons that were unrelated to the operating performance of any one company 
the following factors  in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock publicity regarding actual or potential testing or trial results relating to products under development by us or our competitors the outcome of regulatory review relating to products under development by us or our competitors regulatory developments in the us and foreign countries developments concerning any collaboration or other strategic transaction we may undertake announcements of patent issuances or denials  technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors termination or delay of development or commercialization program s by our partners safety issues with our products or those of our competitors our partners ability to successfully commercialize our partnered products our ability to successfully execute our commercialization strategies announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products or methods by us or others actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet such financial expectations changes in government regulations or policies or patent decisions changes in patent legislation or adverse changes to patent law additions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors publicity regarding actual or potential transactions involving us or economic  political and other external factors beyond our control as a result of these factors  holders of our common stock might be unable to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for such shares 
if there are substantial sales of our common stock  our stock price could decline 
a small number of institutional investors and private equity funds hold a significant number of shares of our common stock 
sales by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares  or the expectation of such sales  could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock 
in addition to our outstanding common stock  as of december   there were a total of  shares of common stock that we have registered and that we are obligated to issue upon the exercise of currently outstanding options and settlement of restricted stock unit awards granted under our second amended and restated management equity plan and equity incentive plan 
upon the exercise of these options or settlement of the shares underlying these restricted stock units  as the case may be  in accordance with their respective terms  these shares may be resold freely  subject to restrictions imposed on our affiliates under rule if significant sales of these shares occur in short periods of time  these sales could reduce the market price of our common stock 
any reduction in the trading price of our common stock could impede our ability to raise capital on attractive terms  if at all 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we currently have research coverage by securities and industry analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us  interest in the purchase of our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders 
proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry  including us  over the last few years 
if faced with a proxy contest or other type of shareholder activism  we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute  which would be disruptive to our business 
even if we are successful  our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or shareholder dispute involving us or our partners because responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions  collaborations or in licensing opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and if individuals are elected to a board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders these actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws  and in delaware law  and our rights plan could prevent or delay a change in control of our company 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors establish a classified board of directors  as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election require that directors only be removed from office for cause provide that vacancies on the board of directors  including newly created directorships  may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office limit who may call special meetings of stockholders prohibit stockholder action by written consent  requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings moreover  on september   our board of directors adopted a rights agreement  the provisions of which could result in significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of a potential acquirer and  accordingly  could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us 
unstable market  credit and financial conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business and have serious adverse consequences on our business 
the recent economic downturn and market instability has made the business climate more volatile and more costly 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if the current equity and credit markets deteriorate further  or do not improve  it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
while we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet current working capital and capital expenditure requirements  a lingering economic downturn or significant increase in our expenses could require additional financing on less than attractive rates or on terms that are excessively dilutive to existing stockholders 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans 
sales of our products and partnered products will be dependent  in large part  on reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers  distribution partners and other organizations 
as a result of the current credit and financial market conditions  these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
in addition  federal and state health authorities may reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements  and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our or our partners product sales and revenue 
customers may also reduce spending during times of economic uncertainty 
in addition  we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business 
for example  we depend upon novartis for both royalty revenue and the further clinical development of fanapt  we use third party contract research organizations for many of our clinical trials  and we rely upon several single source providers of raw materials and contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and product candidates 
due to the recent tightening of global credit and the continued deterioration in the financial markets  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or partners 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected

our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the risk factors section of this report and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of central nervous system disorders 
we believe that each of our products and partnered products will address a large market with significant unmet medical needs by offering advantages over currently available therapies 
our product portfolio includes fanapt iloperidone  a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia  the oral formulation of which is currently being marketed and sold in the us by novartis  and tasimelteon  a compound for the treatment of sleep and mood disorders  including circadian rhythm sleep disorders crsd  which is currently in clinical development 
pursuant to our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we received an upfront payment of million and are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada 
we also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
for the year ended december  we incurred million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of fanapt 
we are conducting four clinical trials to pursue us food and drug administration fda approval of tasimelteon for the treatment of non hour disorder nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
two of the clinical trials were initiated in the third quarter of  the third was initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth was initiated in the fourth quarter of in addition  in the third quarter of  we initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial to study the efficacy of tasimelteon for the treatment of major depressive disorder mdd 
during the year ended december  we incurred million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of tasimelteon 
since we began our operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our compounds 
our ability to generate additional revenues largely depends on novartis ability to successfully commercialize fanapt in the us and to successfully develop and commercialize fanapt in canada and upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the development of our products or product candidates  and to obtain the regulatory approvals for and manufacture  market and sell our products and product candidates 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of part i of this annual report on form k  entitled risk factors 
revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an upfront payment  product sales and future milestone and royalty payments 
revenue is considered both realizable and earned when each one of the following four conditions is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to the million upfront payment will be recognized ratably on a straight line basis from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we recognize revenue from fanapt royalties and commercial and development milestones from novartis when realizable and product revenue upon delivery of our products to novartis 
our revenue also consisted of million of grant revenue for qualified research and development investments under the internal revenue service s therapeutic discovery project credit program which was received in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to third party professional service providers in connection with the services they provide for our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  costs for regulatory consultants and filings  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  all related facilities costs  and salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expenses related to our research and development personnel 
we expense research and development costs as incurred for compounds in the development stage  including certain payments made under our license agreements prior to fda approval 
prior to fda approval  all fanapt manufacturing related and milestone costs were included in research and development expenses 
subsequent to fda approval of fanapt  manufacturing and milestone costs related to this product are being capitalized 
costs related to the acquisition of intellectual property have been expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these acquisitions were made in connection with the company s research and development efforts and have no alternative future use 
milestone payments are accrued in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies which states that milestone payments be accrued when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will be achieved 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our products and product candidates and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
for the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses in the aggregate of million  including stock based compensation expenses of million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products and product candidates 
we expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we continue our efforts to develop our products  product candidates and partnered products and to evaluate potential in license product candidates or compounds 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the years ended december   and included in this table are the research and development expenses recognized in connection with the clinical development of fanapt and tasimelteon 
included in other product candidates are the costs directly related to research initiatives for all other product candidates 
in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  direct project costs fanapt tasimelteon other product candidates total direct product costs indirect project costs facility depreciation other indirect overhead costs total indirect expenses total research and development expenses many of our research and development costs are not attributable to any individual project because we share resources across several development projects 
we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation  related to executive  finance  accounting  information technology  marketing  and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and fees for legal  accounting and other professional services 
general and administrative expenses also include third party expenses incurred to support business development  marketing and other business activities related to fanapt 
for the year ended december   we incurred general and administrative expenses in the aggregate of million  including stock based compensation expenses of million 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and we have accordingly included them in this discussion 
intangible asset  net 
costs incurred for products or product candidates not yet approved by the fda and for which no alternative future use exists are recorded as expense 
in the event a product or product candidate has been approved by the fda or an alternative future use exists for a product or product candidate  patent and license costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected patent life of the related product or product candidate 
milestone payments to our partners are recognized when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will occur 
as a result of the fda s approval of the new drug application nda for fanapt in may  we met a milestone under our original sublicense agreement with novartis which required us to make a payment of million to novartis 
the million is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the pediatric extension is not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
amortization of the intangible asset is recorded as intangible asset amortization 
the carrying values of intangible assets are periodically reviewed to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred 
we had no impairments of our intangible assets for the year ended december  accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
the estimation of accrued expenses involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements 
accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as those under contracts with clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  and fees for marketing and other commercialization activities 
pursuant to our assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize these expenses as the services are provided 
our assessments include  but are not limited to an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  analyses of data that justify the progress  and our judgment 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an upfront payment  product revenue and future milestone and royalty revenues 
revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we recognize revenue related to fanapt royalties and commercial and development milestones as they are realizable and earned  and product revenue upon delivery of our products to novartis 
our revenues have also been derived from grant revenue which is recognized when it is received 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the limited historic information on our publicly traded common stock  expected volatility rates are based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded common stock blended with the historical volatility of the common stock of comparable entities and other factors 
the expected term of options granted is based on the transition approach provided by fasb guidance as the options meet the plain vanilla criteria required by this method 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception other than a dividend of preferred share purchase rights which was declared on september  and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock based compensation expense for a period is also affected by expected forfeiture rate for the respective option grants 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments or expected forfeitures are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
total employee stock based compensation expense  related to all of our stock based awards for the years ended december   and  was comprised of the following year ended december  in thousands research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense income taxes on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities and tax planning strategies 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact our income taxes in the year of resolution 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences becomes deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the utilization of the carryforwards and other factors 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  which includes the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this pronouncement is effective for financial statements issued for annual and interim periods within the first annual period beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including any possible payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and related possible regulatory approvals and our and our partners ability to successfully commercialize our products  product candidates and partnered products 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis relating to fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million of which we recognized million in the remaining amounts will be recognized ratably over the us patent life of fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada

intangible asset  net the following is a summary of our intangible asset as of december  estimated useful life years december  in thousands gross carrying amount accumulated amortization net carrying amount fanapt on may   we announced that the fda had approved the nda for fanapt 
as a result of the fda s approval of the nda  we met a milestone under our original sublicense agreement with novartis which required us to make a payment of million to novartis 
the million was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the pediatric extension is not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic life using the straight line method 
amortization expense was million for the year ended december  we capitalized and began amortizing the asset immediately following the fda approval of the nda for fanapt 
the following table summarizes our intangible asset amortization schedule as of december  in thousands total after intangible asset revenue our company s revenue consisted of the following in thousands december  deferred revenue revenue recognized december  deferred revenue revenue licensing agreement royalty revenue total we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis on october   pursuant to which novartis has the right to commercialize and develop fanapt in the us and canada 
under the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million in december of revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue under the amended and restated sublicense agreement 
we recognize royalty revenue when it is realizable and earned 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of royalty revenue 
our revenues in the past have also been derived from product revenue  which is recognized upon delivery of our products to novartis  and grant revenue  which is recognized when it is received 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are deposits in operating accounts and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of days or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits  investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  and commercial paper of high quality corporate issuers 
our marketable securities consist of investments in government sponsored enterprises and commercial paper 
as of december   we also held non current deposits totaling million  consisting of million used to collateralize a letter of credit issued for our office lease in rockville  maryland  which will terminate in  million used to collateralize a letter of credit issued as a requirement for our license renewal with the maryland board of pharmacy  and million used to collateralize a letter of credit issued for our office lease in washington  dc  which expires in as of december  and  our liquidity resources are summarized as follows as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable securities  current us treasury and government agencies us corporate debt marketable securities  current marketable securities  non current us treasury and government agencies marketable securities  non current total as of december   we maintained all of our cash and cash equivalents in two financial institutions 
deposits held with these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits  but we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such deposits 
fasb guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable level defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions marketable securities classified in level and level at december  and include available for sale marketable securities 
the valuation of level instruments is determined using a market approach  and is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets 
the valuation of investments classified in level also is determined using a market approach based upon quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  or other inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level securities include commercial paper  corporate notes and government agency notes that use as their basis readily observable market parameters 
as of december   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurements at reporting date using in thousands december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level description available for sale securities we believe that our current existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs to execute our current business plan 
tasimelteon is presently in development for nhd and mdd and will require significant resources prior to market approval 
however  the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement in with novartis to commercialize fanapt in the us and canada 
novartis is responsible for the further clinical development activities in the us and canada  including the development of a long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million  and are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada 
we will recognize the million upfront payment ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november  through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in licensing revenue and million in royalty revenue 
we recognize royalty revenue when realizable and earned 
other than participation in the joint steering committee jsc established following the effective date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we have no control over the progress of novartis commercial plans 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the achievement of milestones and royalties under this agreement 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our active product candidates 
we initiated four clinical trials to pursue fda approval of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd in blind individuals without light perception 
two of the clinical trials were initiated in the third quarter of  the third was initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth was initiated in the fourth quarter of the first clinical trial set is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study with a planned enrollment of approximately patients with nhd 
the trial has a six month treatment period and includes measures of both nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as laboratory measures of the synchronization between the internal body clock and the hour environmental light dark cycle 
the second clinical trial is a one year safety study of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd 
this trial is an open label safety study with a planned enrollment of up to patients with nhd 
the third clinical trial reset is a placebo controlled  randomized withdrawal study to examine the maintenance effect of tasimelteon for the treatment of nhd with a planned enrollment of up to patients with nhd 
patients will be followed for weeks during which nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as synchronization of their internal body clock to the hour day  will continue to be evaluated 
the fourth clinical trial is a two year open label  multicenter  study in blind subjects with nhd to assess the safety of tasimelteon 
we plan to conduct these clinical trials over the next one to two years to support the use of tasimelteon as a circadian regulator and the submission of a nda to the fda and a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema 
we are currently in discussions with the fda on the most appropriate way to analyze and present data so that the effect of tasimelteon can be evaluated 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we initiated a phase iib iii clinical trial magellan to study the efficacy of tasimelteon for the treatment of mdd 
the clinical trial is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study with a planned enrollment of approximately patients with mdd 
the trial has an eight week treatment period  followed by an optional one year open label extension  and includes measures of depression and anxiety symptoms  nighttime and daytime sleep  as well as laboratory measures of the internal body clock 
given the range of potential indications for tasimelteon  we may pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of tasimelteon worldwide 
the duration and cost of clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
in addition  orphan clinical trials create an additional challenge due to the limited number of available patients afflicted with the disease 
we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds  primarily consisting of the upfront payment received under the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and investment income will be sufficient to fund our planned operations 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities  the magnitude of our discovery and preclinical development programs and the level of our pre commercial launch activities 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

we will also have the right to sublease or assign all or a portion of the premises  subject to standard conditions 
the lease may be terminated early by us or the landlord upon certain conditions 
we paid a security deposit of million upon execution of the lease 
as a result of our relocation from rockville  maryland to washington  dc  we provided notice to our current landlord  that we were terminating our lease effective june  as a result of terminating this lease  we recognized expenses of million in the fourth quarter of related to a lease termination penalty 
of this amount  million is presented as research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations and million is presented as general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the million in expenses related to the termination penalty represented the total expenses incurred to date

license agreements 
in february and june  we entered into separate licensing agreements with bms and novartis  respectively  for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tasimelteon and fanapt 
on april   we entered into an amended licensing agreement with bms 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis 
we are obligated to make in the case of tasimelteon and  in the case of fanapt in the us and canada  are entitled to receive payments under the conditions in the agreements upon the achievement of specified clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones 
if the products are successfully commercialized we will be required to pay certain royalties and in the case of fanapt in the us and canada  will be entitled to receive based on net sales for each of the licensed products 
as a result of the successful commencement of the phase iii clinical study of tasimelteon in march  we met the first milestone specified in our licensing agreement with bms and subsequently paid a license fee of million 
we are also obligated to make future milestone payments of less than million in the aggregate the majority of which are tied to sales milestones as well as royalty payments based on the net sales of tasimelteon at a rate which  as a percentage of net sales  is in the low teens 
the company is also obligated under this agreement to pay bms a percentage of any sublicense fees  upfront payments and milestone and other payments excluding royalties that the company receives from a third party in connection with any sublicensing arrangement  at a rate which is in the mid twenties 
as a result of the acceptance by the fda of the nda for fanapt in october  we met a milestone under our original sublicense agreement with novartis and subsequently paid a million milestone fee 
as a result of the fda s approval of the nda for fanapt in may  we met an additional milestone under the original sublicense agreement with novartis which required us to make a payment of million to novartis 
the million was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the pediatric extension is not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
no amounts were recorded as liabilities relating to the license agreements included in the consolidated financial statements as of december   since the amounts  timing and likelihood of these payments are unknown and will depend on the successful outcome of future clinical trials  regulatory filings  favorable regulatory approvals  growth in product sales and other factors

in addition  we are no longer required to make any future milestone payments with respect to sales of fanapt or any royalty payments with respect to sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
at novartis option  we will enter into good faith discussions with novartis relating to the co commercialization of fanapt outside of the us and canada or  alternatively  novartis will receive a royalty on net sales of fanapt outside of the us and canada
