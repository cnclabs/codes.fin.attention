it provides the context for the discussion and analysis of the financial statements which follow and does not disclose every item impacting our financial condition and operating performance 
see discussion of our business and the operations within our helicopter services segment under part i 
item business overview included elsewhere in this annual report 
our strategy our goal is to strengthen our position as a leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following well defined business commercial and capital allocation strategies to achieve this goal business commercial strategy be the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our business to be the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our clients and providing safe and high quality service 
in order to create further differentiation and add value to our clients  we have expanded our well established and successful global target zero safety program to also focus on additional areas related to maximizing uptime and service levels 
the new expanded program called the bristow client promise is focused on enhancing our value to our clients through the initiatives of target zero accidents  target zero downtime and target zero complaints 
this program is designed to deliver continuous improvement in all these important areas and demonstrate bristow group s commitment to providing higher hours of zero accident flight time with on time and up time helicopter transportation service 
we maintain relationships with our clients field operations and corporate management that we believe helps us better anticipate client needs and provide our clients with the right aircraft in the right place at the right time  which in turn allows us to better manage our fleet utilization and capital investment program 
we also leverage our close relationships with our clients to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standardized first rate operating and safety practices across our global operations  we seek to provide our clients with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding and delivering on our clients needs with our global operations and safety standards  we believe we effectively compete against other helicopter service providers based on aircraft availability  client service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
grow our business while managing our assets 
we plan to continue to grow our business globally and increase our revenue and profitability over time  while managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
we conduct flight operations in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  and through our strong relationships with our existing clients  we are aware of future business opportunities in the markets we currently 
table of contents serve that would allow us to grow through new contracts 
we anticipate these new opportunities will result in the deployment of new or existing aircraft into markets where we expect they will earn desirable rates of return 
additionally  new opportunities may result in growth through acquisitions and investments in existing or new markets  which may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates  investing in new companies  or creating partnerships and alliances with existing industry participants 
we believe the combination of growth in existing and new markets will deliver improved shareholder returns 
capital allocation strategy our capital allocation strategy is based on three principles as follows logo prudent balance sheet management 
throughout our corporate and business unit management  we proactively manage our capital allocation plan with a concentration on achieving business growth and improving rates of return  within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management 
we have funded our successful growth plan and maintained adequate liquidity by raising approximately billion of debt and equity by means of both public and private financings since fiscal year  and we intend to continue managing our capital structure and liquidity position relative to our commitments with external financings when necessary and through the use of operating leases for of our large aircraft equivalent lace 
our adjusted debt to total equity ratio and total liquidity were and million  respectively  as of march  and and million  respectively  as of march  adjusted debt includes the net present value of operating leases totaling million and million  respectively  letters of credit and guarantees totaling million and million  respectively  and the unfunded pension liability of million and million  respectively  as of march  and highest return of bva 
we have implemented an internal financial management framework we call bristow value added bva to enhance our focus on the returns we deliver across our organization 
bva is computed by subtracting a capital charge for the use of gross invested capital from after tax operating cash flow 
our goal is to achieve strong improvements in bva over time by improving the returns we earn throughout our organization via cost and capital efficiency improvements as well as through better pricing based on the differentiated value we deliver to clients via aircraft safety  availability  client service and reliability  deploying more capital into commercial opportunities where management believes we can deliver strong returns and when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders  making strategic acquisitions or strategic equity investments  and withdrawing capital from areas where returns are deemed inadequate and unable to be sufficiently improved 
when appropriate  we may divest parts of the company 
improvements in bva is the primary financial measure in our management incentive plan starting in fiscal year  aligning the interests of management with shareholders 

table of contents balanced shareholder return 
we have invested billion on capital expenditures to grow our business since fiscal year we believe our liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures  so we have considered our capital deployment alternatives for the future to deliver a more balanced return to our shareholders 
on may   our board of directors approved our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend 
also  on november   our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock within months from that date 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million of our common stock 
the timing and method of any repurchases under the program will depend on a variety of factors  is subject to our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors and restrictions under applicable law and our debt instruments  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
market outlook our core business is providing helicopter services to the worldwide oil and gas industry 
our clients operating expenditures in the production sector are the principal source of our revenue  while their exploration and development capital expenditures provide a lesser portion of our revenue 
our clients typically base their capital expenditure budgets on their long term commodity price expectations and not exclusively on the current spot price 
in  the credit  equity and commodity markets were quite volatile causing many of our oil and gas company clients to reduce capital spending plans and defer projects 
growing confidence among our clients has led to increased capital expenditure budgets resulting in some larger projects moving ahead that were previously on hold 
this led to improvement in our fiscal year financial performance and continued slow and steady growth in fiscal year while we are cautiously optimistic that the economic conditions will continue to recover in fiscal year  we continue to seek ways to operate more effectively and work with our clients to improve the efficiency of their operations 
our global operations and critical mass of helicopters provide us with geographic and client diversity which helps mitigate risks associated with a single market or client 
this economic recovery should lead to an accelerated expansion in fiscal year and beyond and increased demand in many of our core markets 
the limited availability of some new aircraft models and the need throughout the industry to retire many of the older aircraft in the worldwide fleet is a driver for our industry 
currently manufacturers have some available aircraft  however  there are some constraints on supply of new large aircraft 
brazil continues to represent a significant part of our positive growth outlook 
the recent discovery of pre salt deepwater fields in brazil along with the national mandate to significantly increase its production over the next five years will necessitate investment in infrastructure and associated services 
as a result  we anticipate and have begun to enjoy growth in both international oil companies and petrobras activity as they ramp up their procurement of helicopters services 
since  petrobras procured around large aircraft as they renewed their fleet and added incremental capacity in this category 
petrobras issued a tender for over medium sized aircraft in of which a significant portion was incremental capacity 
l der  our investment in brazil  was awarded contracts for of these medium aircraft  which was the maximum amount possible under the bid rules 
seven commenced in fiscal year and the other seven will commence in fiscal year aircraft being procured in this market tend to be newer and more sophisticated which is aligned with both bristow group s client promise and l der s decolar service differentiation programs 
more recently  petrobras is due to issue the results of a tender for approximately eight to ten large aircraft 
there is another tender on the market possibly for two large aircraft to operate in the north northeast region of brazil 
the above growth trend is anticipated to continue to keep pace with brazil s national production policies 
as discussed in item a 
risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report  we are subject to competition and the political environment in the countries where we operate 
in one of these markets  nigeria  we have seen a recent increase in competitive pressure and new regulation that could impact our ability to win future work at levels previously anticipated 
during fiscal year  in both nigeria and australia we had major clients re bid contracts that we were incumbents on and award these contracts to competitors 
the contract in nigeria provided us with annualized revenue of approximately million and ended in fiscal year the contract in australia provided us with annualized revenue of approximately million and ended in may in nigeria  we have seen a recent increase in competitive pressure and new regulation that could impact our ability to win future work at levels previously anticipated 
in order to properly and fully embrace new regulations  we have agreed in principle to make a number of key changes to our operating model in nigeria  while maintaining safety as our number one priority at all times 
these changes are still being finalized  with the objectives of these changes being a allowing each of bhnl and paan to have more autonomy over its own flight operations  b providing technical aviation maintenance services through a new wholly owned bristow group entity  bats  c enabling bhnl and paan to operate freely in the market place each as a completely separate entity with its own distinct identity  management and workforce  and d each of bhnl  paan and bats committing to continue to apply and use all key bristow group standards and policies  including without limitation our target zero safety program  our code of business integrity and our operations manuals 
as a result of these changes  our ability to continue to consolidate bhnl and paan under the current accounting requirements could change 
we conduct business in various foreign countries  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations and related risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
throughout fiscal year  our primary foreign currency exposure was related to the euro  the british pound sterling  the australian dollar  the nigerian naira and the brazilian real

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents bristow group s most important initiative is delivering on our client promise to provide helicopter transportation with unmatched safety  uptime performance and hassle free service 
the foundation of the client promise is the value we place on the work our clients do  with drilling and production teams in remote and challenging offshore environments developing much needed oil and gas resources 
to match client expectations with bristow group s ability to meet and exceed them  we are adding capacity and capabilities to strengthen our service quality program and continue to improve our world class helicopter transport services 
the management of our global aircraft fleet involves a careful evaluation of the expected demand for helicopter services across global energy markets  including the type of aircraft needed to meet this demand 
as offshore oil and gas drilling and production globally moves to deeper water  more medium and large aircraft and newer technology aircraft may be required 
as older aircraft models come off of current contracts and are replaced by new aircraft  our management evaluates our future needs for these aircraft models and ultimately the ability to recover our remaining investment in these aircraft through sales into the aftermarket 
we depreciate our aircraft over their expected useful life to the expected salvage value to be received for the aircraft at the end of that life  however  depending on the market for aircraft or changes in the expected future use of aircraft within our fleet  we may record gains or losses on aircraft sales or impairment charges for aircraft operating or held for sale 
in certain instances where a cash return can be made on newer aircraft in excess of the expected return available through the provision of helicopter services  we may sell newer aircraft 
the number of aircraft sales and the amount of gains and losses recorded on these sales is unpredictable 
while aircraft sales are common in our business and are reflected in our operating results  gains and losses on aircraft sales may result in our operating results not reflecting the ordinary operating performance of our primary business  which is providing helicopter services to our clients 
the gains and losses on aircraft sales are not included in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share or gross cash flows for bva 
during fiscal year  changes were made to our fleet strategy as a result of a a continued shift in demand for our aircraft to newer technology aircraft types  b the introduction of the bristow client promise through which we will position bristow group as the premium service provider of offshore transportation services and c the introduction of bva 
the change in demand for our older aircraft has accelerated over the last few quarters as a result of a renewed focus on safety and reliability across the offshore energy industry after the macondo oil spill in the us gulf of mexico 
the change in fleet strategy resulted in the determination that we will operate certain older types of aircraft for a shorter period than originally anticipated and led to the global review of spare parts inventories supporting our fleet 
this review of inventories resulted in the identification of approximately million of inventory that is dormant  obsolete or excess based on the review of our future inventory needs 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million to write down certain spare parts within inventories to lower of cost or market value during fiscal year additionally  during fiscal year we sold nine asl large aircraft realizing a loss of million 
in conjunction with this sale  we entered into an agreement to sell two more asls during fiscal year  one of which was sold in april as a result of losses realized on the sale of similar aircraft in fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge  included within gain loss on disposal of assets  related to the two asls to be sold in fiscal year and five other held for sale asls of million during fiscal year we also completed a review of the remainder of our held for sale and operational fleet of aircraft  which resulted in the impairment of two medium aircraft that our management intends to sell prior to the previously estimated useful life of the aircraft 
this impairment charge of million is included within depreciation and amortization

these financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditor 
these financial measures are therefore considered non gaap financial measures 
adjusted ebitdar is calculated by taking our net income and adjusting for interest expense  depreciation and amortization  rent expense included as components of direct cost and general and administrative expense  provision for income taxes  gain loss on disposal of assets and any special items during the reported periods 
see further discussion of our use of the adjusted ebitdar metric below 
adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are each adjusted for gain loss on disposal of assets and any special items during the reported periods 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our results because they exclude amounts that management does not consider part of our normal and recurring operations when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization 
a description of the adjustments to and reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures is as follows fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except per share amounts adjusted operating income gain loss on disposal of assets special items i operating income adjusted ebitdar gain loss on disposal of assets special items i depreciation and amortization rent expense interest expense provision for income taxes net income adjusted net income gain loss on disposal of assets ii special items i ii net income attributable to bristow group adjusted diluted earnings per share gain loss on disposal of assets ii special items i ii diluted earnings per share i see information about special items during fiscal years ended march   and under fiscal year compared to fiscal year and fiscal year compared to fiscal year below 
ii these amounts are presented after applying the appropriate tax effect to each item and dividing by the weighted average shares outstanding during the related period to calculate the earnings per share impact 
adjusted ebitdar is a new metric utilized for our reporting within this annual report 
management believes that adjusted ebitdar provides relevant and useful information  which is widely used by analysts  investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance 
adjusted ebitdar provides us with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes 
additionally  we believe that adjusted ebitdar provides us with a better overall measure of our operational performance by excluding the financing decisions we make regarding aircraft purchasing or leasing decisions 
adjusted ebitdar is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap and other 
table of contents companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitdar differently than we do 
as a result  these financial measures have limitations as analytical and comparative tools and you should not consider these items in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
adjusted ebitdar should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
in calculating these financial measures  we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate 
in addition  in evaluating these financial measures  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitdar  as well as adjusted operating income  adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share  should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or special items 
adjusted ebitdar has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap 
some of the limitations are adjusted ebitdar does not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures  adjusted ebitdar does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitdar does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitdar does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitdar differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year our results for fiscal year included a million  or  increase in gross revenue over fiscal year primarily resulting from increased operating revenue from the addition of new contracts and improvements in overall flight activity in our europe and west africa business units  a favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that increased gross revenue by million this primarily benefitted our revenue in europe and australia  and increased reimbursable revenue primarily in europe 
this increase was partially offset by decreased revenue in north america as a result of short term work for bp in support of the spill control and monitoring effort in fiscal year and reduced activity as a result of the impact of permitting delays from new regulations in the us gulf of mexico 
despite the increase in operating revenue  our operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year these decreases primarily resulted from the following items that more than offset the increased revenue in the fiscal year the impact of special items in fiscal years and  as described below  that reduced operating income by million  net income by million and diluted earnings per share by in fiscal year compared to reducing operating income by million and increasing net income by million and diluted earnings per share by in fiscal year a loss on disposal of assets of million during fiscal year compared to a gain on disposal of assets of million in fiscal year resulting in a year over year reduction of operating income of million  net income by million and diluted earnings per share by 
the loss on disposal of assets in fiscal year includes impairment charges of million to reduce the carrying value of aircraft held for sale and a loss of million on the sale of nine large aircraft

pension obligations as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow helicopters group limited a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation  bristow international aviation guernsey limited and bristow norway pension plans 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require the employer to agree to a funding plan with the plans trustee the trustee for securing that the pension plan has sufficient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions liabilities 
in addition  where there is a shortfall in assets against this measure  we are required to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as quickly as can be reasonably afforded

while we have generated significant cash from operations  our principal source of liquidity over the past several years has been financing cash flows 
accordingly  since the beginning of fiscal year  we raised billion of debt and equity capital by means of both public and private financings 
during this same period  we invested billion on capital expenditures to grow our business 
the significant factors that affect our overall liquidity include capital expenditure commitments  pension funding  operating leases  adequacy of bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million  cash flow from operations and proceeds from aircraft sales  as well as available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million as of march   will be sufficient to satisfy our capital commitments  including our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  while we plan to continue being disciplined concerning future capital commitments  we also intend to continue managing our capital structure and liquidity position with external financings as needed 
our strategy will involve funding our short term liquidity requirements with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funding our long term financing needs  while maintaining a prudent capital structure  among the following alternatives a operating and capital leases  b bank debt  c private and public debt and or equity placements and d export credit agency supported financings

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  tax treaties and foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oil service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market conditions in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal year  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated tax exposures of million and during fiscal years and we had net accruals of reserves for estimated tax exposures of million and million  respectively 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate  if recognized 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 

table of contents judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   we have established deferred tax assets for foreign taxes we expect to be realizable  primarily as a result of an internal reorganization that resulted in a one time increase in us taxable earnings and a forecast that includes more us taxable earnings in future years 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of establishing and then realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are indefinitely reinvested abroad of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment 
table of contents evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our management periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenue and cost related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
the recognition of these obligations through the income statement is also affected by assumptions about expected returns on plan assets 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a british pound sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment and  where available  individual plan experience data 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a fair value valuation of assets and an amortization approach for assessed gains and losses that reduces year to year volatility 
this approach recognizes investment and other actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these allowances  we consider a number of factors  including our historical experience  changes in our client s financial position and restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with clients regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to major integrated oil and gas companies and government owned or government controlled oil and gas companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory allowance we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we establish an allowance to distribute the cost of spare parts expected to be on hand at the end of a fleet s life over the service lives of the related equipment  taking into account the estimated salvage value of the parts 
also  we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent 
table of contents liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change and affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known or circumstances that change after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in conjunction with our march  goodwill assessment  we adopted new accounting guidance that allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative assessment should be performed 
an entity may also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 
because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the qualitative factors considered during our assessment include the capital markets environment  global economic conditions  the demand for helicopter services  the necessity for training of new pilots bristow academy only and changes in our results of operations  the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in prior year s quantitative testing and other factors 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples and involve the use of a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future earnings and cash flows and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expense from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in certain foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 
throughout fiscal years  and  our primary foreign currency exposure has been to the euro  the british pound sterling  the australian dollar and the nigerian naira 
the value of these currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar as indicated in the following table 
table of contents fiscal years ended march  one british pound sterling into us dollars high average low at period end one euro into us dollars high average low at period end one australian dollar into us dollars high average low at period end one nigerian naira into us dollars high average low at period end source bank of england and oanda 
com we estimate that the fluctuation of these currencies versus the prior fiscal year had the following effect on our financial condition and results of operations  net of the effect of the derivative contracts discussed below in thousands fiscal year ended march  revenue operating expense earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of losses non operating expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes benefit from income taxes net income from continuing operations cumulative translation adjustment total stockholders investment 
table of contents our earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are also affected by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the reported results of our unconsolidated affiliates 
during fiscal years  and  earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were decreased by million and increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the results of our unconsolidated affiliates  primarily the impact of changes in the brazilian real and the us dollar exchange rate on results for our affiliate in brazil 
the value of the brazilian real has fluctuated relative to the us dollar as indicated in the following table fiscal years ended march  one brazilian real into us dollars high average low at period end a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the average us dollar relative to other currencies would have affected our revenue  operating income and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year as follows euro british pound sterling nigerian naira australian dollar revenue operating expenses income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables  including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  all currencies may not uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
in addition  certain of our contractual commitments  including aircraft purchase commitments  are payable in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to cash flow risk during periods when the us dollar weakens against those currencies 
we entered into forward contracts during fiscal years  and to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
we had no open forward contracts relating to euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments as of march  we had six open forward contracts as of march   which had rates ranging from us dollars per euro to us dollars per euro 
these contracts had an underlying notional value of between  and  for a total of  with the first contract having expired in may and the last in june during the three months ended june   we entered into an additional open forward contract at a rate of us dollars per euro with an underlying notional value of  that expired in july as of march   the fair value of these contracts was an asset of million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
as of march   an unrecognized gain on these contracts of million  net of tax  was included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
no gains or losses relating to forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal years and  however  we recognized gains of million for fiscal year in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other income expense  net as a result of early termination of forward contracts on euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments 
in the past three fiscal years  our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates  we recorded foreign currency gains of million during fiscal year and foreign currency losses of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  primarily related to the british pound sterling 
see fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net and fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of transaction gains and losses 

table of contents a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our clients consist primarily of major integrated  international and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments is minimal 
we also manage our credit risk by not entering into complex financial transactions or those with a perceived high level of credit risk 
for more information on the impact of the global market conditions see executive overview market outlook and liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity included elsewhere in this annual report 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  million of which carries a variable rate of interest 
the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our financial instruments has been estimated in accordance with the accounting standard regarding fair value 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices
