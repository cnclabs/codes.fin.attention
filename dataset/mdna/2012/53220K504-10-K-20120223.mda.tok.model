item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses from continuing operations were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  of which   and  respectively  were sponsored by us 
there were no research and development expenses from discontinued operations in   and competition some of the drugs we are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing intracellular receptor related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 

table of contents many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales

risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect to us 
for marketing outside the united states before fda approval to market  we must submit an export permit application to the fda 
we also are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and there can be no assurance that we or any of our partners will meet and sustain any such requirements 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 

table of contents patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
royalties we currently receive from pfizer  as successor to king on avinza represent a portion of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza is not expected to expire until november  however  applications for generic forms of avinza have been submitted to the fda 
the last to expire united states patents relating to promacta is not expected to expire until december the last to expire united states patents related to captisol is not expected to expire until subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments

human resources as of february   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
risks related to us and our business 
our business has recently undergone a significant change  and we may not be successful in integrating the captisol technology and cydex s other development product candidates into our existing operations or in realizing the planned results from our recently expanded product portfolio and pipeline 
in january  we completed our merger with cydex  in which we obtained the captisol technology  in addition to other product candidates 
we will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize the benefits from this acquisition 
these challenges will include the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of tasks  including the following integrating cydex into our existing operations  integrating cydex s developmental product candidates and successfully managing the development and regulatory processes  and coordinating with cydex s and our collaborative partners concerning the development  manufacturing  regulatory and intellectual property protection strategies for captisol and new development product candidates 
in addition  we rely on our collaborative partners for many aspects of our developmental and commercialization activities  and we are subject to risks related to their financial stability and solvency 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition of cydex 
furthermore  all of cydex s products and product candidates  as well as the technology that it outlicenses  are based on captisol 
in addition  cydex or its partners are attempting to develop some product candidates that may contain significantly higher levels of captisol than in any currently approved product and has directed developers to demonstrate an adequate safety margin  and specifically acceptable renal safety 
if products or product candidates incorporating captisol technology were to cause any unexpected adverse events  whether in preclinical studies  clinical trials or as commercialized products  whether as a result of captisol or otherwise  the perception of captisol safety could be seriously harmed 
if this were to occur  we may not be able to market these products unless and until we are able to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  which we may not be able to do 
further  whether or not the adverse event was a result of captisol  we could be required by the fda to submit to additional regulatory reviews or approvals  including extensive safety testing or clinical testing of products using captisol  which would be expensive and  even if we were to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  would delay our marketing of captisol enabled products and receipt of revenue related to those products 
royalties based on sales of avinza and promacta represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
pfizer  as successor to king is obligated to pay us royalties based on its sales of avinza and gsk is obligated to pay us royalties on its sales of promacta 
these royalties are expected to be a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues for some time 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to avinza or promacta could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
setbacks for avinza and promacta could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government regulation  licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 

table of contents avinza or promacta could also face regulatory action and product safety issues 
for example  the fda previously requested expanded warnings on the avinza label to alert doctors and patients to the dangers of using avinza with alcohol 
changes were subsequently made to the label 
the fda also requested clinical studies to investigate the risks associated with taking avinza with alcohol 
any additional warnings  studies and any further regulatory action could have significant adverse effects on avinza sales 
in september  king reported that actavis  a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products headquartered in iceland  had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with a paragraph iv certification pertaining to avinza  the rights to which were acquired by king from us in february according to the report  actavis s paragraph iv certification sets forth allegations that us patent no 
 or the patent  which pertains to avinza  and which is listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  will not be infringed by actavis s manufacture  use  or sale of the product for which the anda was submitted 
the expiration date for this patent is november king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc  or elan  and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey on october  against actavis  inc and actavis elizabeth llc for patent infringement under the patent 
the lawsuit was settled and dismissed without prejudice in july in july  king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey against sandoz inc  or sandoz  for patent infringement under the patent 
according to the complaint  sandoz filed an anda for morphine sulfate extended release capsules and  in connection with the anda filing  sandoz provided written certification to the fda alleging that the claims of the patent are invalid  unenforceable and or will not be infringed by the manufacture  use or sale of sandoz s proposed morphine product 
similar to the lawsuit against actavis  this lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent sandoz from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 
trial was previously expected to be set to start during the second half of  but the court ordered a stay of proceedings starting on may  an adverse judgement on the patent could significantly impact our future revenues 
our product candidates face significant development and regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales and or milestone revenue 
before we or our partners obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action 
failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rates at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but are not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times 
for example  the trial entitled eltrombopag to reduce the need for platelet transfusion in subjects with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia undergoing elective invasive procedures elevate was suspended in october in accordance with an idmc recommendation 
gsk 
table of contents terminated the elevate study and the program is under review 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 
we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
however  the funding provided to us by our existing collaborative partners for ongoing research and development under our existing collaborative agreements has ceased 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
we obtain captisol from a sole source supplier  and if this supplier were to cease to be able to supply captisol to us  or decline to supply captisol to us  we would be unable to continue to derive revenue or continue to develop our product candidates until we obtained an alternative source  which could take a considerable length of time 
we currently have one supplier of captisol  hovione farmaciencia sa  or hovione  through its agent hovione llc 
hovione is a major supplier of apis and api intermediates located in lisbon  portugal 
hovione has other production sites in cork  ireland and macau  china  but those sites are not yet qualified to make captisol 
if a major disaster were to happen at hovione or hovione were to suffer major production problems or were to fail to deliver captisol to us for any other reason  there could be a significant interruption of our captisol supply 
while we carry a significant inventory of captisol for this type of occurrence  which should permit us to satisfy our existing supply obligations through under current and anticipated demand conditions  an unusually large order or two could rapidly deplete that inventory and cause significant problems with our licensees and disrupt our business 
in addition  if we fail to supply captisol under our supply agreements  our customers could obtain the right to have captisol manufactured by other suppliers  which would significantly harm our business 

table of contents we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of captisol and product candidates  and if these contract manufacturers fail to perform as we expect  we will incur delays in our ability to generate revenue and substantial additional expenses in obtaining new contract manufacturers 
we do not manufacture products or product candidates  but rather contract with contract manufacturers for the manufacture of products and product candidates 
with respect to any specific product or product candidate  we only contract with one contract manufacturer due to the high cost of compliance with good manufacturing practices prior to the contract manufacturer being permitted to manufacture the product or product candidate for use in humans 
if a contract manufacturer is unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture for us in the future  we would be required to contract with a new contract manufacturer for the specific product or product candidate 
in the case of products  this would cause us to lose revenue during the qualification process  and in the case of product candidates  this could cause a delay in the commercialization of the product candidate 
in addition  in either case we would incur substantial additional expenses as a result of the new contract manufacturer becoming qualified 
further  if a contract manufacturer were to experience a delay in producing products or product candidates due to a failure to meet strict fda manufacturing requirements or otherwise  we would also experience a delay in development and commercialization of the product candidate or  in the case of products  sales of the product 
this risk is exacerbated in the case of manufacture of injectables  which require heightened sterility and other conditions as well as specialized facilities for preparation 
if we consume cash more quickly than expected  and if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be forced to curtail operations 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
as of december   we had a negative working capital of million 
clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
also  we may acquire companies  businesses or products and the consummation of such acquisitions may consume additional cash 
for example  as part of the consideration for our recent acquisition of cydex  we distributed approximately million of our cash to cydex stockholders 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a million loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with a lender 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we will make interest only payments for one year at a fixed rate of  with an option to extend the interest only payments for an additional year  which we intend to exercise 
subsequent to the interest only payments  the note will amortize with principal and interest payments due through the remaining term of the loan 
the loan term  including interest only payments  is months 
the contingent value rights agreement cvr agreement that was part of the cydex acquisition obligated us to pay million in january to the cydex stockholders 
in addition  in the event of a default as defined in the cvr agreement  we would be obligated to deliver to an escrow agent the future cash payments called for under the cvr agreement 
there can be no assurances that in the event of a default that we would be able to deliver the lump sum payment to the escrow agent 
in march  we borrowed million from square bank and april we borrowed an additional million from square all outstanding amounts under the loan bear interest at a floating rate equal to basis points above the prime rate and may become immediately due and payable if we fail to maintain a cash balance at square of at least million 
the maturity date of the revolving line of credit facility is march  we paid million on our revolving credit facility in january in october  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale of up to million of equity or other securities  proceeds from which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the form s provides additional financial flexibility for the company to sell shares as needed at any time 
to date  no securities have been issued under this registration statement 

table of contents we believe that our capital resources  including our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty revenues  will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least for the next twelve months 
however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time 
examples of relevant potential changes that could impact our capital resources include the costs associated with our drug research and development activities  and additional costs we may incur if our development programs are delayed or are more expensive to implement than we currently anticipate  changes in collaborative relationships  including the funding we receive in connection with those relationships  the progress of our milestone and royalty producing activities  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  the termination of our lease agreements  the costs of the closure of our operations at our cranbury  new jersey facility  the purchase of additional capital equipment  cash payments  including cvr payments  or refunds we may be required to make pursuant to certain agreements with third parties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the outcome of related litigation 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly  including but not limited to reducing our current headcount  or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with partners or other third parties that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our collaborative partners may change their strategy or the focus of their development and commercialization efforts with respect to our alliance products  the success of our alliance products could be adversely affected 
if our collaborative partners terminate their collaborations with us or do not commit sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or distribution of our alliance products  we could be required to devote additional resources to our alliance products  seek new collaborative partners or abandon such alliance products  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
in march  pfizer completed its acquisition of king  which had purchased the avinza product line from us 
there can be no assurance of the impact that this acquisition will have on our relationship with pfizer 
in september  we received notice from gsk that it was exercising its right to terminate the product development and commercialization agreement  dated as of march  and as amended  among smithklinebeecham corporation  doing business as glaxosmithkline  glaxo group limited and pharmacopeia  llc  as successor to pharmacopeia drug discovery  inc the termination became effective on october  absent the termination by gsk  the research term under this agreement would have terminated on march  following termination  we retained rights to the current programs under this agreement and may continue to develop the programs and commercialize any products resulting from the programs  or we may elect to cease progressing the programs and or seek other partners for further development and commercialization 

table of contents in september  we received a notice from medimmune a subsidiary of astrazeneca that it was exercising its right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement  dated april  upon termination  all materials and know how related to the il antibody program by medimmune was returned to us 
medimmune is required to discuss the granting of a royalty bearing license to intellectual property with respect to the product licensed under the agreement 
however  medimmune has no obligation to grant such a license or retain the ability to grant such a license 
the termination was effective on november  in october  we received notice from merck that it was exercising its right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement  dated november  the collaboration and licensing program was related to the physiology  pharmacology  chemistry  and potential therapeutic applications and potential clinical utilities related to vanilloid receptors  subtype  also known as trpv upon termination  merck is required to transfer and or disclose specified materials and know how to us which is under an obligation to transfer certain specified materials to merck 
in addition  we will receive an exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  royalty free but subject to any third party royalty obligations  fully paid  worldwide license  with right to sub license  under specified patents and technology for the research  development or commercialization of specified compounds and products in a limited field of use 
we will also receive a non exclusive license to all other know how merck deems necessary to sell the specified compounds or products 
the termination will be effective on april  we are currently dependent upon outlicensing business and we may not be successful in entering into additional out license agreements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our liquidity or require us to alter development plans on our products 
we have entered into several out licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of our products 
we currently depend on our arrangements with our outlicensees to sell products using our captisol technology 
these agreements generally provide that outlicensees may terminate the agreements at will 
if our outlicensees discontinue sales of products using our captisol technology  fail to obtain regulatory approval for their products using our captisol technology  fail to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us  or otherwise choose to utilize a generic form of captisol should it become available  or if we are unable to establish new licensing and marketing relationships  our financial results and growth prospects would be materially affected 
further  under most of our captisol outlicenses  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or will cease when the relevant patent expires 
while we have other more recent patents relating to captisol with later expiration dates for example  our high purity patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until and our morphology patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until  the initially filed patents relating to captisol expired in in the us and are expected to expire between and in most countries outside the us if our other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent a generic form of captisol from coming to market and if in such case our outlicensees choose to terminate their agreements with us  the source of the vast majority of our captisol revenue may cease to exist 
although we expend considerable resources on internal research and development for our proprietary programs  we may not be successful in entering into additional out licensing agreements under favorable terms due to several factors including the difficulty in creating valuable product candidates that target large market opportunities  research and spending priorities of potential licensing partners  willingness of and the resources available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to in license product candidates for their clinical pipelines  or differences of opinion with potential partners on the valuation of products we are seeking to out license 

table of contents the inability to enter into out licensing agreements under favorable terms and to earn milestone payments  license fees and or upfront fees may adversely affect our liquidity and may force us to curtail or delay development of some or all of our proprietary programs  which in turn may harm our business and the value of our stock 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact avinza  promacta  viviant and conbriza bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  lgd  and any other products or potential products 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  other possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
expirations of  challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
the initially filed patents relating to captisol expired in in the us and are expected to expire between and in most countries outside the us we have also obtained patent protection in the us through on agglomerated form and through on high purity form of captisol 
we have obtained patent protection on a number of combinations of apis and captisol through three combination patents in the 
table of contents us  and we have applied for six additional combination patents in the us relating to the combination of captisol with specific apis 
our us combination patent relating to fosphenytoin expires june  and our us combination patent relating to amiodarone expires may  our us combination patent relating to one of our early stage product candidates expires march  there is no guarantee that these patents will be sufficient to prevent competitors from creating a generic form of captisol after and competing against us  or from developing combination patents for products that will prevent us from developing products using those apis 
in addition  most of the agreements in our captisol outlicensing business  including our agreements with pfizer relating to geodon im  vfend iv and cerenia  provide that once the relevant patent expires  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or eliminated 
generally  our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the united states patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential 
table of contents products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of our key management and scientific personnel 
if we fail to retain such key employees  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
if plaintiffs bring product liability lawsuits against us or our partners  we or our partners may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our approved products and product candidates  and we may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
we and our partners face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and face an even greater risk for commercialized products 
although we are not currently a party to product liability litigation  if we are sued  we may be held liable if any product or product candidate we develop causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop  injury to our reputation  discontinuation of clinical trials  costs to defend litigation  substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients  loss of revenue and the inability to commercialize any products that we develop 
we have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a million annual limit 
we intend to expand product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any products that we may develop 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our product candidates or any future products  our liability could exceed our total assets 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify eisai and king under certain circumstances pursuant to the asset purchase agreements we entered into with eisai and king in connection with the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
some of our indemnification obligations still remain and our potential liability in certain circumstances is not limited to specific dollar amounts 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 

table of contents the sale of our prior commercial product lines does not relieve us of exposure to product liability risks on products we sold prior to divesting these product lines 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us may not be insured and could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 
if our partners do not reach the market with our alliance products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if our partners are not effective in marketing our alliance products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
our competitors might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than our partners can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us or our partners  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 
we use hazardous materials  which may expose us to significant liability 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
we engage one or more third parties to manage some of our cash consistent with an investment policy that allows a range of investments and maturities 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss are to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
as a result of changes in the credit market  one of our short term investments in commercial paper was in default 
as a result  we were unable to recoup all of our investment in the commercial paper 
in addition  from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
we may require additional funds to run our business and may be required to raise these funds on terms which are not favorable to us or which reduce our stock price 
we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents in october  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale of up to million of equity or other securities  proceeds from which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the form s provides additional financial flexibility for the company to sell shares as needed at any time 
to date  no securities have been issued under this registration statement 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our drug development programs will require substantial additional future funding which could hurt our operational and financial condition 
our drug development programs require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 
our future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and human studies  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in our existing collaborations  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we expect our research and development expenditures over the next three years to continue to be significant 
however  we base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables 
such uncertainties include regulatory approvals  the timing of events outside our direct control such as product launches by partners and the success of such product launches  negotiations with potential strategic partners  possible sale of assets or other transactions and other factors 
any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities from cash generated from royalties and royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so  we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn 
our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the 
table of contents continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
our investment securities consist primarily of money market funds  corporate debt obligations and us government agency securities 
we do not have any auction rate securities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effects on various securities markets 
we cannot provide assurance that our investments are not subject to adverse changes in market value 
if our investments experience adverse changes in market value  we may have less capital to fund our operations 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
in november  we effected a for reverse stock split 
we believe the reverse stock split will have the effect of increasing the per share trading price of our common stock 
many factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including  but not limited to  the following factors results of or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the success of our collaboration agreements  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra  formerly the national association of securities dealers  inc and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of finra 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 
any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
as described in item  we identified a material weakness as a result of improper accounting for significant non routine transactions 
management has determined that the material weakness was a result of inadequate staffing 
since the transaction date which resulted in this material weakness  we have added a corporate controller to our finance and accounting staff 
while we had processes to identify and apply accounting standards to complex transactions  we enhanced these processes with the addition of a resource with the ability to research and understand the nuances of complex accounting standards 
given this material weakness  management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
the existence of one or more material weakness or significant deficiency could result in future errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could 
table of contents lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
impairment charges pertaining to goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets from our mergers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
the total purchase price pertaining to our mergers with pharmacopeia  neurogen  metabasis and cydex have been allocated to net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development and goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price  operating results and results of operations 
we may acquire companies  businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time consuming 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  or issue additional shares  to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
as part of our efforts to acquire companies  business or product candidates or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks and other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we acquire product candidates  we will also need to make certain assumptions about  among other things  development costs  the likelihood of receiving regulatory approval and the market for such product candidates 
our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 
in addition  we will likely experience significant charges to earnings in connection with our efforts  if any  to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that are ultimately not consummated  these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur  as part of a transaction  substantial charges for closure costs associated with elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired ipr d charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
our cydex facilities are located in a tornado zone  and the occurrence of a tornado or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities and equipment  which could cause us to curtail or cease local operations 
our cydex facilities are located outside of kansas city  kansas  which is in a tornado zone 
we are therefore vulnerable to damage from tornados 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  such as 
table of contents power loss  fire  floods and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired 
we are insured against up to million in damages resulting from natural disasters  including tornados 
we currently may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions  and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage 
any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business  financial condition and prospects

overview we are a biotechnology company that operates with a business model focused on developing or acquiring revenue generating assets and coupling them to a lean corporate cost structure 
our goal is to create a sustainably profitable business and generate meaningful value for our stockholders 
since a portion of our business model is based on the goal of partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize and market our assets  a significant amount of our revenue is based largely on payments made to us by partners for royalties  milestones and license fees 
we recognized the important role of the drug reformulation segment in the pharmaceutical industry and in added captisol to our technology portfolio 
captisol is a powerful formulation technology that has enabled five fda approved products  including pfizer s vfend iv and baxter international s nexterone and is currently being used in a number of clinical stage partner programs 
in comparison to our peers  we believe we have assembled one of the largest and most diversified asset portfolios in the industry with the potential to generate significant revenue in the future 
in addition  therapies in development address the unmet medical needs of patients for a broad spectrum of diseases including hepatitis  muscle wasting  alzheimer s disease  dyslipidemia  diabetes  anemia  asthma  rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis 
we have established multiple alliances with the world s leading pharmaceutical companies including glaxosmithkline  merck  pfizer  baxter international  bristol myers squibb  celgene  onyx pharmaceuticals  lundbeck inc  eli lilly co  and the medicines company 
in january  we completed the acquisition of cydex pharmaceuticals  inc  or cydex 
as a result  we gained revenue from four currently marketed products  a large portfolio of partnered drug development programs  an internal pipeline of proprietary drugs  and the captisol drug formulation platform technology 
cydex is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ligand 
in july  we executed a patent license agreement for the exclusive license to make  have made  import  use  sell or offer for sale the compound associated with fablyn 
fablyn is a selective estrogen receptor modulator product candidate that resulted from a collaboration between pfizer and us formed to develop therapies for 
table of contents osteoporosis 
in february  pfizer received approval from the european commission for fablyn tablets 
in october  we entered into a license agreement with chiva pharmaceuticals  inc for fablyn 
under the license agreement  we granted chiva an exclusive worldwide license  with sub license rights  to our intellectual property rights related to fablyn 
chiva is obligated to pay us a non refundable license issuance fee of million on or before june   of which million was received in we are also eligible to receive  under the license agreement  both milestones and royalty payments on worldwide net sales of fablyn 
in october  we entered into a license agreement with privately held sage therapeutics  inc granting sage an exclusive right to use captisol in sage s development and commercialization of therapeutic drugs formulating certain allosteric receptor modulators with captisol against identified central nervous system disorders 
under the license agreement  we will receive upfront and research support payments  and potentially can receive additional payments if sage exercises certain product commercialization options 
upon commercialization  we could potentially receive milestone payments for captisol enabled programs  plus tiered royalties on net sales for products that use the captisol technology 
we are also eligible to receive commercial revenue from the shipment of captisol to sage for clinical and commercial activities 
in december  we entered into a license and supply agreement with eli lilly lilly and company 
under the license agreement  we granted to lilly an exclusive  nontransferable license to such intellectual property rights that will enable lilly to develop and potentially commercialize captisol enabled intravenous oncology therapeutics 
additionally  lilly paid us a non refundable license issuance fee of million 
we are also eligible to receive royalty payments on worldwide net sales of any products that are successfully commercialized 
under the supply agreement  lilly agreed to purchase from us its captisol requirements for the development of the compounds contemplated by the license agreement  as well as any captisol required for any product that is successfully commercialized 
in december  we entered into a license and supply agreement with hospira  inc under the agreement  we granted a license in specified territories  with sub license rights  to such intellectual property rights that will enable the manufacture and sale of certain finished drug products of which captisol is a component 
the terms of the agreement call for us to receive a non refundable license fee of million 
in addition  we received a pre payment of million  to be applied as a credit toward the first million of captisol supplied under the agreement 
in the event of a termination prior to us supplying million of captisol  we will refund the difference of the value of captisol supplied and the million pre payment 
we are also eligible to receive milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain specified sales goals 
in december  our partner onyx pharmaceuticals  inc  or onyx  announced that the us food and drug administration  or fda  had granted standard review designation to the new drug application  or nda  for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date for completion of review by the fda of the nda is july  carfilzomib is also currently being evaluated in two phase clinical trials 
under our agreement with onyx  we are entitled to milestones  royalties and revenue from captisol material sales 
metabasis contingent value rights in january  we completed our acquisition of metabasis 
in addition to cash consideration  we issued four tradable contingent value rights cvrs  one cvr from each of four respective series of cvrs  for each metabasis share 
the cvrs will entitle the holder to cash payments as frequently as every six months as cash is received by us from the sale or partnering of any of the metabasis drug development programs  among other triggering events 
we have also committed to spend at least million within months and million within months  in new research and development funding on the metabasis programs 
through december   we estimate that we have spent approximately million of the committed amount 

table of contents in january  we entered into a strategic relationship with chiva pharmaceuticals  inc to develop multiple assets and technology in china and potentially worldwide 
chiva was granted licenses to begin immediate development in china of two clinical stage hepdirect programs  pradefovir for hepatitis b and mb for hepatocellular carcinoma

under the terms of the agreement  we are entitled to milestones and royalties on potential sales 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a portion of any sublicensing revenue generated from sublicensing of collaboration compounds to third parties in a major world market 
we received a million license payment in march  of which million was remitted to cvr holders 
in august  we entered into an amendment to the license agreement which required that the second million licensing fee be paid in september in addition  the amendment increased royalty rates which we may receive under the license agreement to of net sales of products other than pradefovir and of net sales for pradefovir 
in addition  the amendment removed from the license agreement the provision that we could potentially earn a equity position in chiva as a milestone payment 
the amendment s second million licensing fee payment was received by us from chiva in september  of which million was remitted to cvr holders

refer to item a 
risks factors for additional discussion of the uncertainties surrounding our research and development initiatives 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to costs to operate the cydex business and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of lower headcount related costs as a result of staff reductions  million of lower facilities costs as a result of our lease termination in and million of lower legal costs  partially offset by lower allocations to research and development of million 
lease exit and termination costs in september  we ceased use of our facility located in cranbury  new jersey 
as a result  we recorded lease exit costs of million for costs related to the difference between the remaining lease obligations of the abandoned operating leases  which run through august  and management s estimate of potential future sublease income  discounted to present value 
actual future sublease income may differ materially from our estimate  which would result in us recording additional expense or reductions in expense 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million of property and equipment related to the facility closure 
we also recorded approximately million of severance related costs 
in august  we entered into a lease termination agreement for our corporate facility in san diego 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid a termination fee of million as follows million was paid upon signing  million was paid in july and million was paid in april as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded lease termination costs of million  which includes the net present value of the lease termination payments of million and million of other costs associated with the lease termination 
write off of in process research and development in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write off of intellectual property and interests in future milestones and royalties for medi  an il antibody program by astrazeneca s subsidiary  medimmune

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through offerings of our equity securities  borrowings from long term debt  issuance of convertible notes  product sales and the subsequent sales of our commercial assets  royalties  collaborative research and development and other revenues  capital and operating lease transactions 
we have incurred significant losses since inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had negative working capital of million 
we believe that cash flows from operations will improve due to consistent captisol sales  an increase in royalty revenues driven primarily from continued increases in promacta sales  as well as anticipated new license and milestone revenues 
in the event revenues and operating cash flows are not meeting expectations  management plans to reduce discretionary expenses 
however  it is possible that we may be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to management  or at all 
we believe our available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty  license and milestone revenues will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating and capital requirements  through at least the next twelve months 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the potential success of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the amount of royalties on sales of the commercial products of our partners  the efforts of our collaborative partners  obligations under our operating lease agreements  and the capital requirements of any companies we acquire  including pharmacopeia  inc pharmacopeia  neurogen corporation neurogen  metabasis therapeutics  inc metabasis and cydex pharmaceuticals  inc cydex

the cydex cvr agreement requires us to  in the event of a default  deliver to an escrow agent the future cash payments described above  and such amounts would then be delivered by the escrow agent to the cydex shareholders if  as and when they would have by the cvr agreement been required to be delivered by us 
default includes the following  subject to certain cure rights a we fail to pay to the shareholders account any amount as and when required under the cvr agreement  b at any time we are obligated for more than million of financial indebtedness other than financial indebtedness which is expressly subordinated to all obligations of ligand under the cvr agreement pursuant to a written subordination agreement signed by and reasonably acceptable to the shareholders representative  c at any time after march  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is less than million  or d we commit any material breach of the cvr agreement

we disagree with these claims and intends to work with the shareholders representative to resolve the claims 
if we and the shareholders representative fail to agree  the claims may be resolved through arbitration 
we are also required by the cydex cvr agreement to dedicate at least five experienced full time employee equivalents per year to the acquired business and to invest at least million per year  inclusive of such employee expenses  in the acquired business  through for  we estimate that we have exceeded our committed amount 
based on management s plans  including increases in captisol sales and royalty revenues  as well as anticipated new license revenue and expense reductions  if necessary  we believe our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty  license and milestone 
table of contents revenues will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating and capital requirements  through at least the next twelve months 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the amount of royalties on sales of our partners commercial products  the efforts of our collaborative partners  obligations under our operating lease agreements and lease termination agreement  and the capital requirements of any companies we may acquire  including neurogen  metabasis and cydex 
we believe that the actions presently being taken to generate sufficient operating cash flow provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern 
while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient operating cash flow and in our ability to raise additional funds  there can be no assurances to that effect 
our ability to achieve our operational targets is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient operating cash flow

the investment was highly rated and within our investment policy at the time of purchase  but during the third quarter of  large credit rating agencies downgraded the quality of this security 
in addition  as a result of not meeting certain liquidity covenants  the assets of golden key ltd

critical accounting policies certain of our policies require the application of management judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates made 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition material sales revenue is recognized upon transfer of title  which normally passes to the buyer upon shipment to the customer 
royalties on sales of products commercialized by our partners are recognized in the quarter reported by the respective partner 
revenue from research funding under our collaboration agreements is earned and recognized on a percentage of completion basis as research hours are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under our collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and we have no further performance obligations relating to that event  and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company determines cost using the first in  first out method 
the company analyzes its inventory levels periodically and writes down inventory to its net realizable value if it has become obsolete  has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements 

table of contents co promote termination accounting as part of the termination and return of co promotion rights agreement that we entered into with organon in january  we agreed to make quarterly payments to organon  effective for the fourth quarter of  equal to of avinza net sales through december  and thereafter through patent expiration  currently anticipated to be november the estimated fair value of the amounts to be paid to organon after the termination million as of january  based on the future estimated net sales of the product  was recognized as a liability and expensed as a cost of the termination as of the effective date of the agreement  january in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which approximated million as of december  
as organon has not consented to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event of king s default of this obligation 
therefore  we recorded an asset on february  to recognize king s assumption of the obligation  while continuing to carry the co promote termination liability in our consolidated financial statements to recognize our legal obligation as primary obligor to organon 
this asset represents a non interest bearing receivable for future payments to be made by king and is recorded at its fair value 
as of december  and thereafter  the receivable and liability will remain equal and adjusted each quarter for changes in the fair value of the obligation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
annually management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december  and  the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future undiscounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
during  the irs issued to us a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  seeking an increase to our taxable income for the fiscal year of million and a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million related to the income tax effect of the nopa and million related to estimated interest due on the proposed underpayment of tax 
we also recorded deferred income tax assets of million associated with the ability to carry back losses from and to offset the nopa 
in addition  we recorded an income tax receivable of million associated with changes in income tax law in relation to prior amt taxes paid on carry back periods 
in november  the irs granted us an extension of time to make a closing of the books election with respect to an ownership change  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  for the tax year 
we filed an amended federal tax return in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of in january  we were notified by the irs that they had completed their examination resulting in no changes to the taxes for our tax year 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as recoverability was uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost for awards to employees and non employee directors is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests 
compensation cost for consultant awards is recognized over each separate tranche s vesting period 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  associated with option awards  restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value for options that were awarded to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the expected term of the employee and non employee director options is the estimated weighted average period until exercise or cancellation of vested options forfeited unvested options are not considered based on historical experience 
the expected term for consultant awards is the remaining period to contractual expiration 
volatility is a measure of the expected amount of variability in the stock price over the expected life of an option expressed as a standard deviation 
in selecting this assumption  we used the historical volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation would impact the amount of compensation expenses recognized during the period 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
asu is effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  our adoption of this amendment had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the iasb the boards on fair value measurement 
the collective efforts of the boards and their staffs  reflected in asu no 
 have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
asu no 
amends asc  fair value measurements and 
table of contents disclosures to provide guidance on how fair value measurement should be applied where existing us gaap already requires or permits fair value measurements 
this asu does not extend the use of fair value  but rather provides guidance on application 
in addition  asu no 
requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
our adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu amends topic  comprehensive income  to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders investment 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the provisions of asu no 
should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  which  for the company  will be the beginning of fiscal year early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance  but does not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing for goodwill impairment  which  among other things  amends accounting standards topic intangibles goodwill and other  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test
