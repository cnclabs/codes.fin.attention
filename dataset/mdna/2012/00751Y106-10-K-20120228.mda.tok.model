at december    aap stores  or of total aap stores  had commercial delivery programs 
store development 
our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores within existing markets where we can achieve a larger presence  remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets 
the addition of new stores  along with strategic acquisitions  have played a significant role in our growth and success 
we believe the opening of new stores  and their strategic location in relation to our diy and commercial customers  will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 
we open and operate stores in both large  densely populated markets and small  less densely populated areas 
we complete substantial research prior to entering a new market 
key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population  demographics  vehicle profile  number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate

table of contents the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our aap stores during the past five years beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores does not include stores that opened as relocations of previously existing stores within the same general market area or substantial renovations of stores 
store technology 
our store based information systems  which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service  are comprised of a proprietary pos system and electronic parts catalog  or epc  system 
information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system and enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated  accurate parts information 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete an automotive repair project 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our hub or pdq networks or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  hub  pdq or directly from the vendor with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
we also support our store operations with additional proprietary systems and customer driven labor scheduling capabilities 
our store level inventory management system provides real time inventory tracking at the store level 
with the store level system  store team members can check the quantity of on hand inventory for any sku  adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events  automatically process returns and defective merchandise  designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers 
our stores use radio frequency hand held devices to help ensure the accuracy of our inventory 
our standard operating procedure  or sop  system is a web based  electronic data management system that provides our team members with instant access to any of our standard operating procedures through a comprehensive on line search function 
all of these systems are tightly integrated and provide real time  comprehensive information to store personnel  resulting in improved customer service levels  team member productivity and in stock availability 
store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations store support center in roanoke  virginia  regional office in minneapolis  minnesota  and global sourcing office in taipei  taiwan 
our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories  oil and chemicals 
our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 
in fiscal  we purchased merchandise from approximately vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory productivity 

table of contents our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers 
some of these brands include bosch  castrol  dayco  federal mogul moog  or moog  monroe  prestone  purolator  trico and wagner 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include chemicals  interior automotive accessories  batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft  driveworks  tough one and wearever 
supply chain 
our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses  hub s and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse  hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs 
our replenishment system utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand 
our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 
we currently operate eight aap distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment  reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
we have ongoing supply chain initiatives to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
among these initiatives is the planned opening of our ninth aap distribution center in the new distribution center will provide needed capacity to support our product availability initiatives and will utilize updated technology to eventually be implemented throughout our entire supply chain network 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
we utilize reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores 
in addition to a store s normal inventory assortment  we currently offer approximately  skus to support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have visibility  through our epc system  to inventory in their respective pdq warehouses and distribution centers as well as facilities throughout the company and can place orders to these facilities through an online ordering system 
ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq trucking fleet and third party carriers 
supplementing the inventory on hand at our stores  our hub stores stock an additional  less common skus which are available to our stores within the hub stores service area on a same day or next day basis 
marketing advertising 
our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness and store traffic by positioning the advance auto parts brand as the service leader in the aftermarket auto parts category 
we strive to exceed consumers expectations through our free and value added services  extensive parts assortment and quality merchandise offerings 
in early  we launched our service is our best part campaign nationwide 
the campaign was developed based on extensive research with our customers and team members and brings to life a new brand promise for advance 
the campaign targets core diy and commercial customers and emphasizes our commitment to provide market leading service to our customers 
our multi channel marketing communication plan is built around radio  direct marketing  digital and local marketing 
the plan is supported by public relations  in store and event signage as well as mobile and social media 
we also use spanish language television  radio and outdoor advertising to reach our latino customers 
a final and key component of our advertising is our local marketing program highlighted by our title sponsorship of the advance auto parts monster jam  a live family oriented monster truck event tour and television show 
we are the title sponsor of the show and as such  the advance brand is present throughout each host arena and comes alive through the advance auto parts grinder monster trucks 
we are able to capitalize on the sponsorship at a store level through grinder and other monster truck appearances and through store based customer events in conjunction with the show 
in addition  advance also sponsors various other grass root level events intended to positively impact the individual communities we serve  including latino and other ethnic communities  and to drive awareness and repeated store visits 

table of contents ai segment ai s business primarily serves the commercial market  with an emphasis on parts for imported cars  from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states and florida 
in addition  its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under its own proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer approximately  skus through routine replenishment from its supply chain with access to an additional  to  skus through local sourcing networks 
ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september at december   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states location number of stores location number of stores location number of stores alabama maryland pennsylvania connecticut massachusetts rhode island delaware north carolina vermont florida new hampshire virginia georgia new jersey maine new york the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed approximately  full time team members and approximately  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 
intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international  pdq and service is our best part  for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 

table of contents competition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc 
and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators  v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internet based parts providers 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service  product offerings  availability  quality  price and store location 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing collection  transportation and recycling of automotive lead acid batteries and used automotive oil  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring automotive lead acid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead acid batteries and used oil at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
persons who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 
item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks  both known and unknown 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors 
these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons  including the number and average age of vehicles being driven  because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair 
if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our products 
the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  conversely  during periods of favorable economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  the weather  because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods 
table of contents of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven  because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturer s dealer network using dealer parts  and lower vehicle mileage  which may be affected by gas prices and other factors  decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts  our vendors  because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected  our reputation and our brands  because our reputation is critical to our continued success 
if we fail to maintain high standards for  or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to  product safety  quality or integrity  it could reduce demand for our products 
the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands 
if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic  repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers  our revenues may decline  and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including name recognition  location  price  quality  product availability and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators  v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internet based parts providers 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  store locations  store layouts  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases  more favorable vendor relationships  lower prices  and better product warranties 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending  which would lower our revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines  require us to discontinue current product offerings  or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources  expertise  consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we may lose customers  our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively  or if these initiatives are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

table of contents successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition to the aforementioned risk factors  adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending  our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share  and our ability to continue our commercial sales growth 
for that portion of our inventory manufactured and or sourced outside the united states  geopolitical changes  changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  shipping related issues  natural disasters  pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings  the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from  stores at the end of fiscal to  stores at december  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions 
we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful 
as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things the availability of desirable store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources  including access to capital at cost effective interest rates  and our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates 
we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis  or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 
supply chain our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and hub stores 
as we service our growing store base  we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations 
we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us  of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members  whom we may not be able to attract and retain 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members 
at february   we employed approximately  team members 
we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macro economic conditions  including unemployment  inflation or deflation  consumer debt levels  high fuel and energy costs or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 
impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in and resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms 
we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during and will not occur again in the foreseeable future 
conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and long term borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt 
it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 
our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control 
the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings 
accordingly  any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements 
an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact on our suppliers our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms 
one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions 
these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short term or long term and meet our product requirements 
financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them 
we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers  and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices 
we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies  work stoppages  labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 
impact on our customers deterioration in macro economic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth  financial resources and disposable income 
although the macro economic conditions have improved since and  unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels coupled with low consumer confidence 
this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories  maintenance or repair of their vehicles  which results in lower sales in our stores 
higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 
impact on operating expenses rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs  including our merchandise distribution  commercial delivery  utility and product acquisition costs 

table of contents because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment law matters  payment of wages  asbestos exposure  real estate  and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim  this could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to  among other things  environmental protection  product quality standards  building and zoning requirements  and employment law matters 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions  while incurring substantial legal fees and costs 
in addition  our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
we work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems and website 
in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident  we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions  incur substantial additional costs  or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings  any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace 
the nature of our business requires us to receive  retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services  register on our websites  or otherwise communicate and interact with us 
while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems and website  a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions 
we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring  but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the sections entitled forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december st of each year  which results in an extra week every several years fiscal contained weeks 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal which contained weeks due to our week fiscal introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  accessories  batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states 
our stores carry an extensive product line for cars  vans  sport utility vehicles and light trucks 
we serve both diy and commercial customers 
our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver product from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business  including independent garages  service stations and auto dealers 
at december   we operated  stores throughout states  puerto rico and the virgin islands 
we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts  or aap  and autopart international  or ai 
the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts and western auto 
at december   we operated  stores in the aap segment  of which  stores operated under the trade names advance auto parts and advance discount auto parts throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks 
in addition  we operated stores under the advance auto parts and western auto trade names  located in puerto rico and the virgin islands  or offshore 
the aap segment also includes our e commerce operations 
at december   we operated stores in the ai segment under the autopart international trade name 
ai s business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states and florida 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
management overview we generated earnings per diluted share  or diluted eps  of during fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in our diluted eps was driven by an increase in our operating income and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
our overall financial results steadily improved throughout fiscal primarily due to improving sales trends and decrease of our selling  general and administrative sg a expense rate 
we believe our strong financial results have been driven by favorable industry dynamics  adjustments we made earlier in the year to slow the pace and breadth of change from the implementation of our strategic initiatives and the benefits from the investments we have made over the last several years to support our service leadership and superior availability strategies 
our sg a rate decreased as a result of less incentive compensation  productivity improvements from our new variable store labor model  which enables us to better staff our stores to customer demand  and a focused reduction in administrative expenses partially offset by additional costs associated with initiatives under our two key strategies and increased advertising 
partially offsetting our sg a leverage during fiscal was a slightly lower gross profit rate 
this decrease in gross profit rate compared to fiscal was due to a number of internal and external factors  including higher shrink expense  additional supply chain costs associated with our supply chain investments and commodity price inflation combined with the timing of retail price changes 

table of contents the increase in our operating cash flow in fiscal compared to the prior year allowed us to repurchase shares of our common stock and invest in capital improvements and initiatives to support our strategies 
as discussed in the business update below  we remain committed to investing in our two key strategies 
fiscal highlights highlights from our fiscal include financial total sales during fiscal increased to  million as compared to fiscal  primarily driven by a increase in comparable store sales and the addition of net new stores 
our operating income increased million in fiscal compared to the prior year and increased as a percentage of total sales by bps due to the leverage of our sg a rate partially offset by a lower gross profit rate 
our inventory balance as of december  increased million  or  over the prior year driven primarily by our superior availability initiatives and new store growth 
we generated operating cash flow of million during fiscal  primarily due to the increase in our net income  an increase in accounts payable and fluctuations in other working capital balances 
we used available cash and borrowings to repurchase million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program at a cost of million 
other subsequent to fiscal  in january we issued million of senior unsecured notes  due in  with an interest rate of 
business update in fiscal  we increased our focus on differentiating advance from our competition through our commitment to exceptional service which is reflected in our new customer promise service is our best part and the simplification of our previous four key strategies into two strategies service leadership and superior availability 
superior availability centers around product availability and maximizing the speed  reliability and efficiency of our supply chain 
service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our diy and commercial customers whether in our stores or on line 
through these two key strategies  we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term 
our commercial sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal since we completed incremental investments in additional parts professionals  delivery trucks and drivers in a significant number of our aap stores with commercial programs 
we decelerated the pace of these investments during fiscal to focus and achieve better execution in those areas we believe have a direct impact on customer satisfaction for both our commercial and diy customers such as labor scheduling  training  commercial delivery speed and accuracy and increased advertising 
our e commerce operations continue to supplement our store sales growth through an increase in diy sales from our advanceautoparts 
com website and more recently through the added capability for our commercial customers to order product on line 
on an ongoing basis  we closely monitor independent customer satisfaction scores for both commercial and diy customers as a measure of customer service and product availability 
our commercial and diy sales and total gross profit have benefited from our added parts availability and merchandising initiatives 
we continue to expand our supply chain network to increase our ability to get the right product to our customers in a timely manner 
we upgraded the inventory levels in of our stores during fiscal and added stores to our hub store network during fiscal bringing the total number of hubs to our hub stores stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory and provide same day delivery to our other stores or customers in their respective areas 
we plan to open our ninth aap distribution center in remington  indiana during the third quarter of fiscal this new facility will provide productivity improvements resulting from the added capacity and a more advanced distribution system 
we continue to increase the amount of product we source globally  which we believe will improve our gross profit across numerous product categories and allow us to more quickly source the products our customers need 

table of contents we anticipate that the pace of our growth in commercial will continue to exceed the pace of our diy growth 
the continued growth in our commercial sales emphasizes our focus on an integrated service model and our goal of achieving a mix of commercial and diy sales 
we believe our current initiatives are key for our long term sales growth and improvement in our gross profit rate 
combined with our focus on balancing support and discretionary expenses with the additional cost of investments in our key strategies  we are committed to achieving our longer term growth and profitability goals 
automotive aftermarket industry the automotive aftermarket industry remains strong despite volatility in the overall economic environment 
favorable industry dynamics include increase in number and average age of vehicles  lower new car sales versus the ten year average  long term expectation that miles driven will increase based on historical trends  and fragmented commercial market 
conversely  there are a number of factors which are negatively affecting the automotive aftermarket industry and include higher gas prices  near term downward trend in miles driven  and overall reduction in discretionary spending on elective maintenance and other accessories 
given the uncertainty in the economic environment  we have adjusted our operations and financial plans without compromising our core strategic investments over the long term 
we believe that the execution of the various initiatives under our key strategies will allow us to continue to increase our share of the total automotive aftermarket with a higher growth potential driven by the more fragmented commercial market 
store development by segment the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and by segment

table of contents components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our e commerce website 
our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including e commerce sales 
we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective merchandise and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix  ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  iii vendor programs  iv inventory shrinkage  v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs 
we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume requirements  when we believe it is advantageous 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent and depreciation  advertising expenses  commercial delivery expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  share based compensation expense  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses  self insurance costs  closed store expense  impairment charges  if any  and other related expenses

table of contents interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in interest expense as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of the amortization of previously recorded unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of interest rate swaps

in addition  we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offering as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  a decrease of million compared to january  the end of fiscal 
this decrease in cash primarily resulted from the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the purchase of property and equipment partially offset by cash inflow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additional discussion of our cash flow results  including the comparison of fiscal activity to fiscal  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 

table of contents at december   our outstanding indebtedness was million  or million higher when compared to january   and consisted of borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  million under our senior unsecured notes  million outstanding on an economic development note and million outstanding under other financing arrangements 
additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility to million 
the letters of credit serve as collateral for our self insurance policies and routine purchases of imported merchandise 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings  maintenance of existing stores  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  or million more than fiscal during fiscal  we opened aap stores and ai stores  remodeled aap and ai stores and relocated aap and ai stores 
our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and supply chain networks 
we anticipate adding to aap stores and to ai stores and closing approximately total stores during fiscal we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and additional investments in our supply chain  information technology and other capabilities to support our key strategies 
in fiscal  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 
these investments will be primarily driven by new store development  investments in our existing store base and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies  including supply chain and new systems 
these expenditures include a new warehouse management system and costs associated with the completion of our remington  in distribution center scheduled to open in the third quarter of stock repurchase program our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec

long term debt bank debt on may   we entered into a new million unsecured five year revolving credit facility with our wholly owned subsidiary  advance stores company  incorporated  or stores  serving as the borrower 
this new facility replaced our previous revolving credit facility 
proceeds from the new revolving credit facility were used to repay million of principal outstanding on our previous revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with this refinancing  we incurred million of financing costs which we will amortize over the term of the new revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed million 
we may request  subject to agreement by one or more lenders  that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding million up to a total commitment of billion during the term of the revolving credit facility 
voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part  at our option  in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures on may  as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less 
the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based  at our option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the current margin is and per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings  respectively 
a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility  payable in arrears 
the current facility fee rate is per annum 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the interest rate and facility fee are based on our credit rating 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability to  among other things create  incur or assume additional debt  incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments including acquisitions  guarantee obligations  engage in certain mergers and liquidations  change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries  enter into certain hedging transactions  and change our status as a holding company 
we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with our covenants in place at december  and january   respectively 
our revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default  covenant defaults and cross defaults to other material indebtedness 
senior unsecured notes our senior unsecured notes  the notes  were issued in april at of the principal amount of million and are due may  we served as the issuer of the notes with certain of our domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors 
the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures collectively the indenture among us  the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time  at the redemption price described in the indenture 
in addition  in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture  we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture 

table of contents subsequent to december   we entered into an underwriting agreement on january  pursuant to which we sold million aggregate principal amount of notes due january   the notes  at a public offering price of of the principal amount per note 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing on july  the terms of the notes are also governed by the indenture and contain similar redemption  repurchase and guarantee terms as the notes 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the notes offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes 
the notes offering was part of our capital structure plan to continue to improve our financial foundation by securing longer term funding at favorable terms to help fund our future growth 
as of december   we had a credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and from moody s investor service of baa the current outlooks by standard poor s and moody s are both stable 
the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings 
if these credit ratings decline  our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase 
conversely  if these credit ratings improve  our interest rate may decrease 
in addition  if our credit ratings decline  our access to financing may become more limited 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item of the sec regulations 
we include other off balance sheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments  interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 
contractual obligations in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility  we utilize operating leases as another source of financing 
the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations 
our future contractual obligations related to long term debt  operating leases and other contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt interest payments operating leases other long term liabilities note for additional information refer to note  long term debt  note  income taxes  note  lease commitments  note  store closures and impairment  note  contingencies  and note  benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  exhibits  financial statement schedules  of this annual report on form k 
our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements 
accordingly  we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table 
long term debt primarily represents the amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility which becomes due in fiscal and the principal amount of our notes  which become due in fiscal subsequent to year end  we issued million of notes  due in fiscal  which is not included in the above table 
we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions 
these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 

table of contents primarily includes the long term portion of deferred income taxes  self insurance liabilities  unrecognized income tax benefits  closed store liabilities and obligations for employee benefit plans for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond months from december  accordingly  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional considerations 
many of these incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less short term 
volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sg a are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor s products are included as an offset to sg a when the cost is incurred 
certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 
amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 
total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was million and million at december  and january   respectively 
similarly  we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
however  these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
short term incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any short term agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables  net except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets  net 
we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations 
historically  the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 
a difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales 
conversely  a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales 
our inventory reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise  among other things 
we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories  results from other targeted inventory counts and historical and current loss trends 
in our distribution facilities  we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements 
if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents our inventory consists primarily of parts  batteries  accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives 
although the risk of obsolescence is minimal  we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory 
we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand 
we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels  ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions 
we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit 
in certain situations  we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 
our total inventory reserves increased by million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in shrink during fiscal future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory  changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  warranty reserves we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties  the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer s warranty is borne by our vendors 
however  we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer 
merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks 
we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense  the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
a change in the warranty reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  self insurance reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
historically  our total self insurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth  including an increase in stores  team members and commercial delivery vehicles 
while these factors continued to contribute to the overall increase in our self insurance reserves in fiscal  we also experienced favorable claims development primarily related to our workers compensation claims which helped to offset the increase 
our self insurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed  claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
specific factors include  but are not limited to  assumptions about health care costs  the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims 
generally  claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle 
effective january   we classified million of our self insurance liability as long term because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding sg a could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units 
these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units 
the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units  including but not limited to size and projected growth 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law  codes  regulations  pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  the evolution of tax law  codes  regulations and court cases  along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  new accounting pronouncements for a description of recently announced accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements  see new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form k
