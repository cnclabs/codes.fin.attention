overview we are a world leading supplier of critical biologic products used to manufacture biologic drugs 
in december  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of novozymes biopharma sweden  ab thereby diversifying and expanding our bioprocessing product offering and customer base  as well as doubling our manufacturing capacity 
we also apply our expertise in biologic product development to secreflo  for which our first new drug application nda has been submitted and accepted for priority review by the us food and drug administration fda and for which we have submitted a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema 
secreflo is a synthetic version of the human hormone secretin being developed by the company as a novel imaging agent for use in combination with magnetic resonance imaging mri to improve the detection of pancreatic duct abnormalities in patients with pancreatitis 
we have begun expending substantial resources on pre commercialization activities for secreflo 
if our nda is approved  we expect these expenditures to increase materially as we seek to commence commercial sales of secreflo 
we also have two early stage central nervous system cns rare disease programs that are advancing through phase clinical trials in friedreich s ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy 
in addition  we have out licensed certain intellectual property from which we receive royalties from bristol myers squibb company bristol on their net sales in the us of their product orencia 
total revenue in the nine month fiscal year ended december  increased as compared to the nine months ended december  and is primarily due to an increase in bioprocessing product sales orders from our single largest customer as well as increased royalty revenue from bristol as their product orencia continues to penetrate the market 
on december   pursuant to the terms of the asset transfer agreement  dated as of october  the asset transfer agreement  by and among the company  repligen sweden ab  a company organized under the laws of sweden and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company repligen sweden  novozymes biopharma dk a s  a company organized under the laws of denmark novozymes denmark  and novozymes biopharma sweden ab  a company organized under the laws of sweden and a wholly owned subsidiary of novozymes denmark novozymes sweden and  together with novozymes denmark  novozymes  we completed the acquisition of novozymes business headquartered at novozymes sweden s facility in lund  sweden and all related operations  including the manufacture and supply of protein a affinity ligands and cell culture ingredients for use in industrial cell culture  stem and therapeutic cell culture and biopharmaceutical manufacturing the novozymes biopharma business 
pursuant to the asset transfer agreement  repligen sweden a purchased all of the assets related to the novozymes biopharma business and assumed certain specified liabilities related to the novozymes biopharma business from novozymes sweden 
table of contents and b purchased contract rights and licenses used in the novozymes biopharma business and other specified assets from novozymes denmark collectively  the transferred business and the acquisition of the transferred business  the novozymes acquisition 
the novozymes biopharma business now operates as repligen sweden 
we paid a purchase price of million euros million plus an additional net working capital adjustment of million euros million for a total upfront cash payment of million euros million to novozymes for the transferred business upon the consummation of the novozymes acquisition 
in addition  novozymes has the right to contingent payments of up to million euros million consisting of i an earn out of million euros million if the transferred business achieves sales of a minimum quantity of a novozymes product between january  and december   ii two milestone payments of million euros million each if sales of certain novozymes products achieve agreed levels for the combined calendar years and and for calendar year  respectively  and iii technology transfer payments totaling million euros million following the successful transfer of certain novozymes manufacturing technology 
the novozymes acquisition has led to substantial increases in both the size and revenue of the combined company as well as operational costs associated with the combined business 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as being critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  including in the results of operations section  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we generate product revenues from the sale of bioprocessing products to customers in the life science and biopharmaceutical industries 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the product delivered and the collectability of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who comprise the majority of revenue and have excellent payment histories and therefore we do not require collateral 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 
at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of the sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales return  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol and began recognizing royalty revenue from that settlement in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia  which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we recognized royalty revenue of  for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
revenue earned from bristol royalties is recorded in the periods when it is earned based on royalty reports sent by bristol to us 
we have no continuing obligations to bristol as a result of this settlement 
our royalty agreement with bristol provides that we will receive such royalty payments on sales of orencia by bristol through december  
table of contents additionally  during the year ended march   we earned and recognized approximately  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin  inc chirhoclin for their sales of secretin 
revenue earned from chirhoclin royalties was recorded in the periods when it was earned based on royalty reports sent by chirhoclin to us 
as of december   chirhoclin had fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  the european friedrich s ataxia consortium for translational studies  go friedreich s ataxia research gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
for the nine months ended december   we recognized  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
during the year ended march   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
in the fiscal year ended march   we also recognized approximately  in one time grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  which was created in march as part of the patient protection and affordability care act 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation 
research revenue is recognized when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which incurred costs qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreements and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in the arrangements 
however  should the estimated calculations change or be challenged by other parties to the agreements  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
the calculations have not historically changed or been challenged  and we do not anticipate any significant subsequent change in revenue related to sponsored research and development projects 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
we do not currently have any revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that would be accounted for pursuant to accounting standards board update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  asu no 
or arrangements pursuant to which we expect to receive significant milestone payments that would be accounted for under asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method 
inventories inventories relate to our bioprocessing business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value  using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventory at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished products 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by key customers for the next three to months 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenue 
manufacturing of bioprocessing finished goods is done to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 

table of contents business combinations amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  if any  based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management 
any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of contingent consideration includes estimates and judgments made by management regarding the probability that future contingent payments will be made  the extent of royalties to be earned in excess of the defined minimum royalties  etc 
management updates these estimates and the related fair value of contingent consideration at each reporting period 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in our statement of operations 
we use the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships and developed technology 
this approach determines fair value by estimating after tax cash flows attributable to these assets over their respective useful lives and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our assumptions on estimates of future cash flows  expected growth rates  expected trends in technology  etc 
we base the discount rates used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and certain industry specific risk factors 
we believe the estimated purchased customer relationships and developed technology amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the assets 
the allocation of consideration transferred for the acquisition of the novozymes biopharma business is preliminary as a result of a preliminary valuation report that includes a preliminary fair value assigned to fixed assets 
we intend to finalize the valuation report and the fair value of fixed assets in the near term 
as a result  the fair values assigned to intangible assets and fixed assets  and the resulting gain on bargain purchase could change in future reporting periods 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using the straight line method 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the last day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   the impairment test date was december  
table of contents accrued liabilities we estimate accrued liabilities by identifying services performed on our behalf  estimating the level of service performed and determining the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by us  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs that have been incurred as of each reporting date  and professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
we have processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  the reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services often require the exercise of judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there have been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among our employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term  exclusive of any events not reasonably anticipated to recur over the option s expected term 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual 
table of contents forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non executive level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for executive level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  respectively  for stock options granted under the second amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan the plan 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  respectively  for stock options granted under the plan 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
we expect  unvested options to vest over the next five years 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenues for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december  as well as the fiscal years ended march  and were comprised of the following nine months ended december  year ended march  unaudited change change in thousands  except percentages bioprocessing product revenue royalty and other revenue total revenue substantially all of our bioprocessing products are based on recombinant protein a and are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma and a variety of cancers 
sales of our bioprocessing products are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   bioprocessing product sales increased by  or as compared to the nine months ended december  volume increased due to increased demand from certain key customers and other business events  and was offset by a decrease in sales revenue due to changes in the mix of products sold in the nine month fiscal year ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  we sell our assorted bioprocessing products at various price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total product revenue and cost of product revenues from period to period 
during the fiscal year ended march   bioprocessing product sales increased by  or as compared to the fiscal year ended march  volume increased due to increased demand from 
table of contents certain key customers and other business events  and was offset by a decrease in sales revenue due to changes in the mix of products sold in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  following the completion of the novozymes acquisition  we anticipate that bioprocessing product sales will more than double in the year ending december  our bioprocessing product sales may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of large scale production orders 
pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we recognized royalty revenue of  for the nine month fiscal year ended december  as well as  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
for the year ending december   we expect royalty revenues to increase moderately over the prior year as bristol s orencia continues to penetrate the market 
the royalty arrangement with bristol expires on december  additionally  during the fiscal year ended march   we earned and recognized approximately  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin for their sales of secretin 
as of december   chirhoclin fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of our secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  the european friedrich s ataxia consortium for translational studies  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
for the nine months ended december   we recognized  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  go friedreich s ataxia research gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
in the fiscal year ended march   we also recognized approximately  in one time grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  which was created in march as part of the patient protection and affordability care act 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation 
we expect research and license revenues to remain relatively consistent in the year ending december  as the muscular dystrophy association grant related effort continues 
costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december  as well as the fiscal years ended march  and were comprised of the following nine months ended december  year ended march  unaudited change change in thousands  except percentages cost of product revenue cost of royalty and other revenue research and development selling  general and administrative gain on bargain purchase total costs and operating expenses 
table of contents for the nine month fiscal year ended december   cost of product revenue increased  or as compared to the nine months ended december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in bioprocessing product sales as well as the addition of the novozymes biopharma business which accounts for  of the cost of product revenue increase 
the increase in cost of product revenue of  or in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  is primarily due to a increase in bioprocessing product sales and a change in product mix and is partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances 
as noted above  we anticipate revenues to more than double due to the novozymes acquisition 
as these products are manufactured in a cgmp facility in sweden  we anticipate gross margins may be lower in the year ending december  pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we must remit of royalty revenue received through the expiration of the agreement in december to the university of michigan 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december   cost of royalty revenue was  and  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  cost of royalty revenue was  and  respectively 
these increases are directly related to the increases in bristol royalty revenues noted above 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external pharmacology and toxicology research  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
our nda for secreflo for pancreatic imaging is currently under review by the fda and our maa is under review by the ema 
we anticipate spending approximately to million in research and development related to this program in the year ending december  in addition  we are preparing to initiate a phase clinical study of rg in patients with friedreich s ataxia  and we have initiated a phase clinical study for rg for spinal muscular atrophy in healthy volunteers 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs  we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program  and therefore  have not provided an estimate of historical costs incurred by project 
each of our therapeutic research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion dates of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
arrangements with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for and of our research and development expenses for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december   respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  arrangements with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to the nine months ended december  this increase is comprised primarily of a  increase in costs associated with drug product manufacturing and other costs associated with 
table of contents the nda submission for secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  offset by a  settlement related to this program from a dispute with parexel international corporation  the parent company of perceptive informatics  inc and a  increase related to rg for spinal muscular atrophy  which includes a  milestone payment made in april upon successful filing of our investigational new drug application with the fda  as well as other costs associated with the initiation of our phase clinical trial 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease related to rg for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder as we discontinued this program in march and a  decrease related to our friedreich s ataxia program as we incurred higher costs in the prior period related to testing and drug substance manufacture in preparation for our upcoming phase study of rg in adult patients with friedreich s ataxia in europe 
during the fiscal year ended march   research and development expenses decreased by  or as compared to the fiscal year ended march  this decrease is comprised primarily of  related to our secretin program for mri imaging of the pancreas as the re analysis of the images obtained from our phase clinical trial was completed in the fiscal year ended march  and the clinical trial was ongoing in the fiscal year ended march    related to our uridine program to treat bipolar depression as we completed our phase b trial in march and  related to our friedreich s ataxia program 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase related to our rg program for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy 
future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in the year ending december  to increase primarily due to the novozymes acquisition  drug manufacturing  regulatory and filing fees associated with the regulatory approval of secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas and continued development and expansion of our opus product line 
also in the year ending december   we plan to continue our phase studies for rg for friedreich s ataxia and rg for spinal muscular atrophy 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts  including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services  amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   sg a costs increased by  or as compared to the nine months ended december  this increase is primarily comprised of approximately  in transaction costs related to the novozymes acquisition   related to commercialization efforts as we prepare to launch secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending fda approval   due to headcount increases in marketing and business development  including salaries  stock based compensation and recruiting costs   related to business development activities  and  due to increased development and sales and marketing activities related to our opus product line 
in the fiscal year ended march   sg a costs increased by  or as compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase is primarily due to increased personnel expenses of approximately  due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries  stock based compensation and recruiting costs  increased investor relations expenses of  increased patent prosecution costs of  and increased amortization expense of  related to the acquisition of the assets of bioflash partners  llc bioflash 
we expect sg a expenses to increase in the year ending december  primarily due to the novozymes acquisition  commercialization efforts as we prepare to launch secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending fda approval  and slightly higher headcount and related personnel expenses 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   we recorded a  gain on bargain purchase related to the novozymes acquisition on december  
table of contents investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december  was  and  respectively 
investment income for the fiscal years ended march  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or for the nine month fiscal year ended december  compared to the nine months ended december  as well as the decrease of  or in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  are primarily attributable to lower interest rates 
we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes in the nine month fiscal year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of  that is comprised of a  provision for a deferred tax liability related to goodwill amortization and a  benefit for a deferred tax asset related to a net operating loss for repligen sweden ab 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities  which enabled us to recover  of alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
as a result  the company had an effective tax rate of negative 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  revenues derived from product sales  and research grants  as well as proceeds and royalties from litigation settlements 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue  royalties from bristol s sales of orencia through december   and research and development grants 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
at december   following the completion of the novozymes acquisition  we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  a deposit for leased office space of  is classified as restricted cash and is not included in cash and marketable securities total for december  or march  cash flows in thousands nine months ended december  year ended march  cash provided by used in increase decrease increase decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the nine month fiscal year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of  reflecting a net loss of  and non cash charges totaling  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation charges and the gain on bargain purchase

contractual obligations as of december   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent consideration total represents purchase orders for the procurement of raw material for manufacturing as well as clinical materials to support our upcoming trials 
these minimum contingent consideration amounts relating to acquisitions are recorded in accrued expenses and long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the expansion of our bioprocessing business  the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products  the resources required to successfully integrate the novozymes biopharma business and recognize expected synergies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  the success of our clinical studies  our ability to establish one or more partnerships for commercialization of secreflo outside the us  our ability to acquire additional products or product candidates  the extent of any share repurchase activity  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the amount of royalty revenues we receive from bristol 
absent acquisitions of additional products  product candidates or intellectual property  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months 
we expect to incur increased expenses in the year ending december  this is primarily due to the novozymes acquisition  commercialization efforts as we prepare to launch secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending regulatory approval  the development and expansion of our opus product line  and our ongoing development of rg for friedreich s ataxia and rg for spinal muscular atrophy 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  the acquisition of additional products and technologies to complement our manufacturing capabilities  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key research and development activities 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace

table of contents in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities and enabled us to receive a refund of  for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  we believe  however  that the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us agency obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited
