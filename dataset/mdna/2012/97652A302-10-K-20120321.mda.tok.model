overview we provide marketing technology solutions  which include digital signage  interactive kiosks  mobile messaging  social networking and web development solutions  to customers who use our products and services in certain retail and service markets 
through our proprietary ronincast x software  we provide enterprise  web based and hosted content delivery systems that manage  schedule and deliver digital content over wireless and wired networks 
we also provide custom interactive software solutions  content engineering and creative services to our customers 
while our marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries  we focus on three primary markets automotive  food service including qsr  fast casual and managed food services markets  and retail 
the industries in which we sell goods and services are not new but their application of marketing technology solutions is relatively new within the last five years and these industries have not widely accepted or adopted these types of technologies as part of their marketing strategies 
as a result  we remain an early stage company without an established history of profitability  or substantial or steady revenue 
we believe this characterization applies to our competitors as well  which are working to promote broader adoption of marketing technology solutions and to develop profitable  substantial and steady sources of revenue 
we believe that the adoption of marketing technology solutions will increase substantially in years to come both in industries on which we currently focus and in other industries 
we also believe that adoption of our marketing technology solutions  which includes digital signage  depends not only upon the software and services that we provide but upon the cost of hardware used to process and display content in digital signage systems 
digital media players and flat panel displays constitute a large portion of the expenditure customers make relative to the entire cost of digital signage systems 
costs of these digital media players and flat panel displays have historically decreased and we believe will continue to do so  though we do not manufacture either product and do not substantially affect the overall markets for these products 
if prices continue to decline for this hardware  we believe that adoption of digital signage and other marketing technology solutions are likely to increase  though we cannot predict a precise rate at which adoption will occur 
management focuses on a wide variety of financial measurements to assess our financial health and prospects but principally upon sales  to measure the adoption of our marketing technology solutions by our 
table of contents customers  cost of sales and gross profit  particularly expressed as gross profit percentage  to determine if sales have been made at levels of profit necessary to cover operating expenses on a long term basis based upon assumptions regarding adoption  sales of hardware relative to software and services  understanding that hardware typically provides a lower gross profit margin than do software license fees and services  operating expenses so that management can appropriately match those expenses with sales  and current assets  especially cash and cash equivalents used to fund operating losses thus far incurred 
our wholly owned subsidiary  wireless ronin technologies canada  inc rnin canada  an ontario  canada provincial corporation located in windsor  ontario  maintains a vertical specific focus in the automotive industry and houses our content engineering operation 
rnin canada develops digital content and sales support systems to help retailers train their sales staff and educate their customers at the point of sale 
today  the capabilities of this operation are integrated with our historical business to provide content solutions to all of our clients 
our company and our subsidiary sell products and services primarily throughout north america 
our sources of revenue we generate revenues through system sales  license fees and separate service fees  including consulting  content development and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance  including product upgrades 
we currently market and sell our software and service solutions primarily through our direct sales force  but we also utilize strategic partnerships and business alliances 
our expenses our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales associates and commissions paid on sales 
this category also includes amounts spent on the hardware and software we use to prospect new customers  including those expenses incurred in trade shows and product demonstrations 
our research and development expenses represent the salaries and benefits of those individuals who develop and maintain our software products including ronincast and other software applications we design and sell to our customers 
our general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead  including administrative salaries  real property lease payments  salaries and benefits for our corporate officers and other expenses such as legal and accounting fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives  volatility factors in determining fair value of options and warrants  tax provisions  recognition of revenue under fixed price contracts  provisions for uncollectible receivables and deferred revenue 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue primarily from these sources software and software license sales system hardware sales 
table of contents professional service revenue software design and development services implementation services maintenance and hosting support contracts we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition software or asc to all transactions involving the sale of software licenses 
in the event of a multiple element arrangement  we evaluate if each element represents a separate unit of accounting  taking into account all factors following the guidelines set forth in fasb asc we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  or services have been rendered  iii customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is probable 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into arrangements with customers that include a combination of software products  system hardware  maintenance and support  or installation and training services 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among the various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the undelivered elements determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
in software arrangements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value for all elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value have been delivered 
the vsoe for maintenance and support services is based upon the renewal rate for continued service arrangements 
the vsoe of installation and training services is established based upon pricing for the services 
the vsoe of software and licenses is based on the normal pricing and discounting for the product when sold separately 
each element of our multiple element arrangements qualifies for separate accounting 
however  when a sale includes both software and maintenance  we defer revenue under the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the undelivered maintenance and support fees included in the price of software is amortized ratably over the period the services are provided 
we defer maintenance and support fees based upon the customer s renewal rate for these services 
software and software license sales we recognize revenue when a fixed fee order has been received and delivery has occurred to the customer 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies based upon signed agreements received from the customer confirming terms of the transaction 
software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cd rom  and license files are delivered electronically 
system hardware sales we recognize revenue on system hardware sales generally upon shipment of the product or customer acceptance depending upon contractual arrangements with the customer 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales 

table of contents professional service revenue included in services and other revenues is revenue derived from implementation  maintenance and support contracts  content development  software development and training 
the majority of consulting and implementation services and accompanying agreements qualify for separate accounting 
implementation and content development services are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
for fixed fee contracts  we recognize revenue upon completion of specific contractual milestones or by using the percentage of completion method 
software design and development services revenue from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for clients are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with fasb asc through percentage of completion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract 
estimated revenues for applying the percentage of completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made 
we measure our progress for completion based on either the hours worked as a percentage of the total number of hours of the project or by delivery and customer acceptance of specific milestones as outlined per the terms of the agreement with the customer 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenue and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenue that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of sales and classified in accrued expenses in the balance sheet 
our presentation of revenue recognized on a contract completion basis has been consistently applied for all periods presented 
we classify the revenue and associated cost on the services and other line within the sales and cost of sales sections of the consolidated statement of operations 
in all cases where we apply the contract method of accounting  our only deliverable is professional services  thus  we believe presenting the revenue on a single line is appropriate 
costs and estimated earnings recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as unbilled services and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
implementation services implementation services revenue is recognized when installation is completed 
maintenance and hosting support contracts maintenance and hosting support consists of software updates and support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes access to technical support personnel for software and hardware issues 
we also offer a hosting service through our network operations center  or noc  allowing the ability to monitor and support our customers networks days a week  hours a day 

table of contents maintenance and hosting support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically one to three years 
maintenance and support is renewable by the customer 
rates for maintenance and support  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
our hosting support agreement fees are based on the level of service we provide to our customers  which can range from monitoring the health of our customer s network to supporting a sophisticated web portal 
basic and diluted loss per common share basic and diluted loss per common share for all periods presented is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
basic weighted average shares outstanding include only outstanding common shares 
diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding computed in accordance with the treasury stock method 
shares reserved for outstanding stock warrants and options totaling million  million and million for  and  respectively  were excluded from the computation of loss per share as their effect was antidilutive due to our net loss in each of those years 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized in the financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
temporary differences arise from net operating losses  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables and inventory  differences in depreciation methods  and accrued expenses 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line amortization method over the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense  including the amortization of warrants issued for debt issuance costs  of million  million and million was charged to operating expenses during  and  respectively 
no tax benefit has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that we have recorded 
we account for equity instruments issued for services and goods to non employees under fasb asc accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and fasb asc accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
generally  the equity instruments issued for services and goods are shares of our common stock  warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock 
these shares  warrants or options are either fully vested and exercisable at the date of grant or vest over a certain period during which services are provided 
we expense the fair market value of these securities over the period in which the related services are received 
see note in the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information regarding the impact of fasb asc and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock based compensation

table of contents compared to sales our sales increased to million in from million in the year over year increase in revenue was primarily attributable to revenue related to the deployments of chrysler s ishowroom branded tower application into chrysler and fiat dealerships 
revenue generated from chrysler and the associated fiat dealerships totaled million in  which was up from million recognized for the prior year 
in addition to assisting chrysler with its ongoing development needs related to the ishowroom initiative during  million of our revenue from chrysler and the associated fiat dealerships came from orders for over  interactive kiosks as part of its branded tower salon to be installed at approximately dealers 
since the start of this program in september  we have received orders for a total of chrysler and fiat dealerships 
we currently believe that chrysler will continue to rollout the ishowroom branded tower application enhancements with further dealership adoption 
however  since we do not have a contract with chrysler requiring it to source all the various components of the solution through us and the purchase of the ishowroom branded towers will remain within the discretion of individual dealerships  we are unable to predict or forecast the timing or value of any future orders 
the remaining increase in sales when comparing to was due to an increase in orders from aramark 
total sales to aramark in totaled million  representing an increase of from we continued to expand the number of grille works installations to several colleges and universities during the past year 
upon completing the installation for orders received through december   the total number of aramark locations being managed through our noc will increase to approximately sites  compared to sites at the end of we continue to provide traditional digital menu boards to yum s qsr brands in  which includes kfc and kfc tacobell combination stores 
during  we installed digital menu boards at six new kfc stores 
the total number of yum brand stores we fully host and support through our noc was over at the end of during  we increased the total number of sites deploying thomson reuter s infopoint digital signage to locations  which we support through our noc 
this includes the expansion from to of the number of infopoint installed sites for a financial services institution with over  locations 
we also continue to engage in discussions with thomson reuters regarding deployment of its digital signage subscription news service to the financial services industry 
we continue to work for  and receive orders from  various customers in the qsr and fast casual restaurant industry as they come to realize the benefits of deploying digital signage for an array of different types of menu boards for both inside and outside applications 
additionally  starting in  we have begun to deploy other marketing technology solutions within our three primary verticals  qsr  automotive and retailers  as a way of creating unique customer experiences 
these technologies include interactive kiosks  ipad applications  mobile messaging  qr codes and the integration of social networks into our product offerings 
we believe these new technologies greatly expand the marketing solutions we are able to provide our existing and prospective customers and represent an opportunity to increase our revenue beyond the traditional digital signage we offer 
as of december   we had a total of million of purchase orders for which we had not recognized revenue 
lastly  our recurring hosting and support revenue increased in to million when compared to as a result of the expansion of our customer base from the deployments referenced above 
due to the current economic environment and the lengthy sales cycle associated with deploying large scale marketing technology solutions  including digital signage  we are not able to predict or forecast our future revenue with any degree of precision at this time 

table of contents cost of sales our cost of sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the year over year increase in hardware sales 
on a percentage basis  our overall gross margin declined to in compared to for the prior year 
the primary reason for this decline was that sales of hardware  which traditionally carries a lower gross margin percentage  accounted for a larger percentage of our overall sales in when compared to additionally  our ronincast x software gross margins of for were lower by percentage points when compared to as a result of higher costs associated with third party software 
partially offsetting these declines was a continued improvement in our services gross margin percentage to in  which was up percentage points from in as a result of the increase in recurring hosting and support fees 
our ability to maintain these levels of gross margin on a percentage basis can be impacted in any given quarter by shifts in our sales mix 
however  we believe over the long term our gross margins on a percentage basis will continue to increase as our recurring revenue grows 
operating expenses sales and marketing expense includes the salaries  employee benefits  commissions  stock compensation expense  travel and overhead costs of our sales and marketing personnel  as well as trade show activities and other marketing costs 
total sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in the decline in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to lower compensation expense of million  partially offset by an increase in trade shows and other consulting services of million 
we continue to focus our efforts to maximize the return on investment by attending many of the leading industry digital signage tradeshows  as we believe our presence is necessary to attract and retain new customers 
we traditionally incur higher levels of tradeshows expenditures in the first quarter of our fiscal year compared to the remaining three quarters 
total stock compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense was approximately million for both and any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses for relative to would be the result of higher levels of commission expense resulting from an increase in our revenue  as we do not anticipate higher costs associated with tradeshows or marketing initiatives 
research and development expense includes salaries  employee benefits  stock compensation expense  related overhead costs and consulting fees associated with product development  enhancements  upgrades  testing  quality assurance and documentation 
total research and development expenses for decreased to million from million in the year over year decrease was primarily due to lower levels of contractor and other engineering consultants expense incurred 
the additional contractor costs incurred in were primarily associated with the first release of our next generation of digital signage software  ronincast x  which became generally available during the fourth quarter of overall we had developer employees and contractors as of december  compared to as of the end of although we currently have no intention of increasing our staff levels in  we have engaged outside providers to assist in augmenting our development efforts as we continue to make further enhancements to our ronincast x software 
we believe these enhancements are critical for our success as the requirements for a more sophisticated multi marketing technology platform continue to evolve 
general and administrative expense includes the salaries  employee benefits  stock compensation expense and related overhead cost of our finance  information technology  human resources and administrative employees  as well as legal and accounting expenses  consulting and contractor fees and bad debt expense 
total general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher levels of fees paid to outside consultants of million  along with additional professional fees for investor relations and costs associated with complying with the new xbrl filing requirements with the sec in of million 
offsetting these costs was a decrease in compensation and benefits which was primarily the result of the former ceo retiring at the end of december and other reductions to our general and administrative headcount made during totaling million 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative costs for totaled million  compared to million in we believe our general and administrative costs will not increase significantly in when compared to 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
our depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of computer equipment and office furniture and the amortization of purchased software and leasehold improvements made to our leased facilities 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the limited number of capital acquisitions during through interest expense interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily the result of lower expense recognized related to the fair value of the warrants issued to silicon valley bank as additional consideration for the million loan and security agreement in march and later modified in january and july during  we included in interest expense a charge of  for the fair value of the warrants compared to  for the same period in the warrant vested on date of grant and we are recognizing the fair value  as determined using the black scholes model  of  over the one year life of the agreement on a straight line basis 
the loan and security agreement modification in january included a provision to reduce the exercise price associated with the warrant  resulting in an incremental increase in fair value of per share 
the fair value remaining as of the date of the modification totaled  and is being amortized on a straight line basis through the renewed expiration date of march see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the assumptions used in determining the fair value of this warrant 
also included in interest expense for and was  and  respectively  associated with the capital lease we entered into in july compared to sales our sales increased to million in from million in the year over year increase in revenue was primarily attributable to revenue generated from our marquee customers  including chrysler  aramark  yum kfc and thomson reuters  in addition to new customers 
revenue generated from chrysler totaled million  which was up from million recognized for the prior year 
in addition to assisting chrysler with its ongoing development needs related to the ishowroom initiative during  over half of our revenue from chrysler came from its orders for digital signage systems as part of its branded tower salon to be installed at dealers 
aramark continued to deploy its food concepts  including burger studio and topio s  at many colleges and universities within the united states 
during we installed approximately new locations  which more than doubled the total number of aramark sites managed by our network operations center  or noc  from the beginning of our sales to aramark during totaled million  representing an increase of when compared to total sales in we continued to penetrate further within yum s qsr brands in by deploying kfc tacobell combination stores 
additionally  we installed a total of new kfc stores  bringing the total number of yum brand stores which we fully host and support through our noc to approximately at the end of we continued to rollout digital menu boards for all new and remodeled stores for kfc 
furthermore  kfc began to implement a new highly customized web portal that we finished developing and delivered during in sales to thomson reuters increased to million in when compared to  as we continued to expand the number of infopoint digital signage locations 
as of december   we had a total of locations we supported through our noc 
additionally in  we received an order to deploy infopoint at sites for a financial services institution with over  locations 
lastly  our recurring hosting and support revenue increased in to million when compared to as a result of an expansion of our customer base from the deployments referenced above 

table of contents cost of sales our cost of sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was due to the year over year increases in hardware sales and cost associated with delivering our services  including installation  project management  software development and content creation 
on a percentage basis  our overall gross margin improved to in compared to for the prior year 
the primary reason for this increase was the favorable hardware margin we were able to achieve from customers for whom we provided a turn key digital signage solution 
in addition  sales of our ronincast software were up in when compared to  which yielded a gross margin percentage of over for both years 
in addition  our services margin continued to improve as the level of recurring hosting and services revenue increased  which totaled million in compared to million in as a result we experienced an improvement in our services gross margin of percentage points to when comparing to operating expenses total sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in during  our stock compensation expense  which was lower by million compared to  was the primary reason for this decrease in our sales and marketing expenses 
stock compensation expense totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year 
total research and development expenses for increased to million from million in the year over year increase was primarily the result of higher levels of contractor and other engineering consultant expenses as we finished up the first release of our next generation of digital signage software  ronincast x 
since the majority of the development effort of this new software platform was completed during  we incurred additional outside resource costs which primarily accounted for the increase in research and development expenses when compared to the prior year period 
total general and administrative expenses for decreased to million from million in the decline was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation and benefits  along with reduced contractor costs  partially offset by higher levels of stock compensation expense 
the reduction in compensation and benefits was the direct result of a cost optimization plan that was implemented during  which included an overall reduction in full time employees 
offsetting these reductions was a million increase in stock compensation expense in when compared to as a result of new equity incentives provided to both employees and outside contractors 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the limited number of capital acquisitions during interest expense interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily the result of  of expense recognized related to the fair value of the warrants issued to silicon valley bank as additional consideration for the million loan and security agreement dated march  the warrant vested on date of grant and we are recognizing the fair value  as determined using the black scholes model  of  over the one year life of the agreement on a straight line basis

as a result of the contractually imposed limits on our borrowing base  the amount available to us under the loan and security agreement  based on calculations as of march   was  based on our positive working capital  we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our operations  working capital and capital resource needs through at least the next months 
we will continue to evaluate operating expenses and make adjustments in the case of any changes in our projected revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that if needed  we will be able to borrow against the line of credit 
in addition  if needed  we may obtain additional debt or equity capital to meet all of our existing cash obligations  however  there can be no assurance that any necessary sources will be available or available on terms favorable to us 
operating activities we do not currently generate positive cash flow 
our investments in infrastructure have been greater than sales generated to date

we also recognized approximately million less revenue in the fourth quarter of when compared to the same period in the prior year 
our inventory balance at the end of was lower when compared to the year end balance of as a result of certain customers deciding to source displays and media players directly from third party suppliers  as well as overall better inventory management

net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  in and  net cash used in investing activities was attributable to the purchases of property and equipment

some of our prospective customers may cancel or delay spending on the development or roll out of capital and technology projects with us due to continuing economic uncertainty 
difficult economic conditions have adversely affected certain industries in particular  including the automotive and restaurant industries  in which we have major customers 
we could also experience lower than anticipated order levels from current customers  cancellations of existing but unfulfilled orders  and extended payment or delivery terms 
economic conditions could also materially impact us through insolvency of our suppliers or current customers 
while we have down sized our operations to reflect the decrease in demand  we may not be successful in mirroring current demand 
if customer demand were to decline further  we might be unable to 
table of contents adjust expense levels rapidly enough in response to falling demand or without changing the way in which we operate 
if revenue were to decrease further and we are unable to adequately reduce expense levels  we might incur significant losses that could adversely affect our overall financial performance and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   chrysler accounted for of our total receivables 
in the case of insolvency by one of our significant customers  an account receivable with respect to that customer might not be collectible  might not be fully collectible  or might be collectible over longer than normal terms  each of which could adversely affect our financial position 
in one case in the past  we converted a customer s account receivable into a secured note receivable then into the underlying collateral  which we ultimately wrote off 
in the future  if we convert other accounts receivable into notes receivable or obtain the collateral underlying notes receivable  we may not be able to fully recover the amount due  which could adversely affect our financial position 
furthermore  the value of the collateral which serves to secure any such obligation is likely to deteriorate over time due to obsolescence caused by new product introductions and due to wear and tear suffered by those portions of the collateral installed and in use 
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer credit losses in the future 
based on our current and anticipated expense levels and our existing capital resources  we anticipate that our cash will be adequate to fund our operations through our future capital requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services  develop new products and services and establish and leverage our strategic partnerships and business alliance relationships 
in order to meet our needs should we not become cash flow positive or should we be unable to sustain positive cash flow  we may be required to raise additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  would likely involve restrictive covenants 
adequate funds for our operations  whether from financial markets  collaborative or other arrangements  may not be available when needed or on terms attractive to us  especially with credit markets which continue to be risk adverse 
if adequate funds are not available  our plans to expand our business may be adversely affected and we could be required to curtail our activities significantly 
necessary funding may not be available on terms that are favorable to our company  or at all
