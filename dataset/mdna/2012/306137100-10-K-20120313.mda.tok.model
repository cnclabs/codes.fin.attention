investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we spent taking stock of where the company stands and making changes to position the company for success going forward 
we also continued to be impacted negatively by the discovery in september   that improper payments had been made in connection with a customer s licensing of software from us 
in january  jim mcniel was named our president and chief executive officer 
mr 
mcniel had been serving in those capacities on an interim basis since the discovery of the improper payments 
throughout the year  we continued to make additional changes to our senior management to put in place a team to lead the company 
in  we hired new vice presidents of sales for each of our three geographic regions the americas  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific apac 
we also brought onboard a new chief financial officer and we made a series of changes at the top of our engineering organization 
we will continue to evaluate our current management structure in order to help ensure that we have the appropriate senior management personnel to lead the company 
the investigations by the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york and by the securities and exchange commission into the company s actions regarding the improper payments continued during and remain unresolved 
these investigations take up time and resources  both human capital and money  that we then cannot invest in our core business 
so far  we have incurred over million of costs on the investigations related to attorneys fees and for certain costs associated with the possible resolustion of the government investigations 
the company  along with certain current and former officers  directors and employees  and the estate of reijane huai  our former chairman and ceo  also remains a defendant in a class action lawsuit brought by stockholders and in an action putatively brought derivatively on the company s behalf by stockholders 
this civil litigation also takes up time and resources 
the investigations and the lawsuits are more fully described in part  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
in addition to their being distractions from our efforts to promote  market and sell our goods and services  the investigations and the lawsuits could negatively impact the perception that customers or potential customers have of our company which could reduce our potential revenues 
we know that our competitors have tried to use these events against us in the marketplace 
we cannot predict how long the external investigations or the stockholder lawsuits will last or what the outcomes will be 
with regard to our business operations  our transition from a company that is dependent on revenue from oem customers to a company that sells branded products is essentially complete 
in  our total revenue from oem customers declined to less than of our total revenue for the first time since we are pleased that we have been able to survive a cumulative decrease in total revenues from oems over the past two years of approximately million representing successive over annual declines 
our revenues now come mainly from our falconstor branded gateway appliances and complete turn key appliances with integrated disks  and licenses of our stand alone software products 
the appliances integrate our software with standard hardware configurations 
the integrated products were created in response to feedback we received from our resellers and the end users suggested that we could increase sales if we offered turn key appliances 
this has proven to be correct 
our product revenues from falconstor branded solutions increased over  from million to million 
we are continuing to invest in our falconstor branded products and in our channel development and marketing activities 
we expect that these investments will result in further increases in falconstor branded product revenue in 
table of contents product revenues from oems declined from million in to million in  however overall revenues did not decrease 
for the first time since  emc did not represent or more of our total revenues 
we do not expect to exit the oem business entirely 
oems can be valuable partners for us in a number of ways 
among these are allowing penetration of markets  both geographical and industry sector  where we do not have sufficient resources or history  providing feedback on product development and quality  and providing distribution channels for products that we may be de emphasizing in our falconstor branded product line 
an oem relationship in china continues to be a source of revenue to the company 
we currently do not expect the decline in revenues from oems to continue at the same rate in an increase in support and services revenues also helped to offset the decline in oem product revenues 
support and services revenues increased from million in to million in overall  our total revenues  which include products  support and services  for the full year grew less than to million in compared with million in we currently anticipate that revenue will increase in compared with net loss for the year was million compared with a net loss of million in as discussed more fully below  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax provision of million due to the write down of certain deferred tax assets 
we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net results for each year 
typically  we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating loss for was million  compared with operating loss of million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
included in the operating loss are costs of million in and million in related to costs associated with the ongoing government investigations 
net of these expenses  and costs of the government investigations  we had a significant drop in our operating loss 
we attribute this drop primarily to a strategic reduction in headcount we made in we ended with fewer employees than at the end of after a drop from to  our gross margins stabilized in for both and  our gross margins were 
the drop from to was attributable to the shift in sales from oems to falconstor branded products 
sales of falconstor branded turn key appliances require us to purchase hardware from third party vendors 
our margins on the resale of the hardware as part of an appliance are significantly lower than our margins on sales of software only solutions  particularly sales to oems 
because sales of appliances have become the core of our business plan  our margins were bound to decrease 
operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our operating margin decreased in to  compared with in the impact of the investigation costs on operating margin in and was equivalent to and  respectively 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  growth in deferred revenue  the development and sales of our new products  
table of contents re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for data protection and storage solutions 
we anticipate that in product revenue by resellers and  to a lesser extent  direct licenses to end users  will continue to grow 
we expect to see the results of our investments in new leadership and in our sales force and our marketing teams 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by resellers 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
we continue to enhance our reseller program 
in  we introduced our business partner program for our resellers in the americas and apac 
this program provides enhanced sales collateral  training  and  in some cases  financial incentives  for our resellers 
we expect to roll out the business partner program in emea in as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
the type of resellers with whom we are signing agreements has continued to evolve 
while we still sign agreements with strong local and regional resellers  we have also entered into reseller agreements with national and multi national resellers who have their own distribution networks 
the enhanced distribution and marketing networks offered by these larger resellers should help us to continue to grow our sales 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not selling our products at the levels we expected in we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in we continued to work to decrease our expenses in besides watching our expenditures  we undertook a review of our workforce and made strategic reductions in our headcount 
however  due to the costs of the investigation  overall  our operating expenses increased in from million in to million in we expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 

table of contents share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
the primary risks to our success come from the government investigations and product development 
for more information the risks we face  please see part i  item a  risk factors  of this filing 
the government investigations into the improper payments to a customer present risks to the company for the following reasons 
first  we do not know what fines  penalties or other economic sanctions will be imposed on the company 
we have accrued million for certain costs associated with the possible resolution of the government investigations  but there is no assurance that this amount will be enough 
if the actual number is higher  it will leave us with less money to invest in our business which could cause us to have to forego important hiring  development activities  acquisitions of companies or technology  or investments in infrastructure 
if the amount is high enough  it could cause customers and partners to worry whether we will continue in business 
our customers rely on us to provide ongoing support of our products 
if the company is in a precarious financial state  they could be reluctant to license our products for fear that we will not be around to support the products in the future 
second  the government investigations are a distraction to our core business 
the time our management team spends on the investigations is time that they cannot spend on running our business 
third  our competitors have used  and likely will continue to use  the pending investigations as a tool against us in the marketplace 
in terms of product development  we need to provide a continuing series of new products and improvements to existing products 
innovation in the data protection market is key to survival 
customers expect that data protection software will become both more capable and easier to manage over time 
if we are unable to deliver new  innovative products in a reasonable time frame  we will fall behind our competitors 
innovation requires adequate resources and the right people 
if we do not have enough resources or the right people  we will fall behind 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during  we shifted our focus to selling turn key solutions  whereby our software is integrated with industry standard hardware and sold as one complete integrated solution 
as a result  commencing in the second quarter of  we reclassified our revenue into two categories i product revenue  and ii support and services revenue 
product revenue consists of both integrated solutions and stand alone software revenues 
support and services revenues consists of both maintenance revenues and professional services revenues 
as a result of the reclassification  we have a corresponding cost of revenues for each revenue category 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased less than to million  compared with million for the year ended december  during  we completed a restructuring which was composed of a workforce reduction of approximately global positions from various departments and a satellite facility 
the restructuring charges totaled approximately million and have been segregated from each of the respective expense line items and are included within restructuring costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
our cost of revenues remained consistent at million for both the years ended december  and december  included in our cost of revenues for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
our operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in the operating results for the year ended december  were i million of restructuring costs  and ii million of costs associated with the ongoing government investigations that commenced during the second half of the million was comprised of million of legal fees  and an accrual of million for certain costs associated with the possible resolution of the government investigations 
included in the operating results for the year ended december  was million of costs associated with the government investigations 
the million was comprised completely of legal fees 
in addition  included in our operating expenses for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax provision of million  compared with an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the income tax provision of million was primarily attributable to the impact of our effective tax rate on our pre tax losses for the year ended december  the income tax provision of million recorded during the year ended december   was the result of a full valuation allowance recorded on substantially all of our existing domestic deferred tax assets as a result of our inability to utilize our domestic deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis in future periods 

table of contents overall  the marginal increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in support and service revenues for the year ended december   compared with the same period in in total  our product revenues decreased 
product revenues from our non oem partners increased  while product revenues from our oem partners decreased for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the overall increase in our non oem product revenues was primarily attributable to the continued focus and emphasis on our falconstor branded business 
however  throughout  the company experienced several disruptions which adversely impacted our non oem product revenue growth 
first  during the first half of  our north american sales organization was in a period of transition 
we recruited substantially an entire new sales team which led to lower than anticipated product revenues from north america during this period due to the time required to develop and train a new sales force 
second  during mid  our european operations were impacted as a result of the ongoing uncertainties and disruptions in the overall european economy  and changes in senior management of the european operations 
finally  the ongoing government investigations and uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome of these investigations all adversely impacted our overall non oem product revenue growth 
in addition  as anticipated  our oem product revenues continued to decline  as a result of merger and acquisition activity involving some of our historically major oem partners that began in and which we have previously reported 
we do not anticipate that any of our oem partners will contribute over of our annual revenues in any period in the near term 
however  because of our well established installed customer base  support and services revenues continued to grow and have not been as significantly impacted by the disruptions in our oem business 
overall  our total operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to additional costs of i million associated with the ongoing government investigations  and ii million of restructuring costs incurred during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in although we incurred over million of additional costs during  we were successful in reducing costs in other aspects of our business with declines in our overall salary and personnel costs as part of our continued cost savings initiatives and focus on achieving improved operational efficiencies  as well as lower share based compensation expense 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate headcount levels to properly align our resources with our current and long term outlook

support and services revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents the increase in support and services revenue was primarily attributable to maintenance and technical support services  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in as we are in business longer  and as we license more integrated solutions and stand alone software applications to new customers and grow our installed customer base  we expect the amount of maintenance and technical support contracts we have to grow as well 
the anticipated growth in our maintenance and technical support service revenue is expected to result primarily from i the purchase of maintenance and support contracts by our customers  and ii the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by our existing and new customers after their initial contracts expire 
professional services revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the professional services revenue varies from period to period based upon i the number of integrated solutions sold during the existing and previous periods  ii the number of our customers who elect to purchase professional services  and iii the number of professional services contracts that were completed during the period

cash inflows from financing activities were also impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options during as discussed in note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of auction rate securities we hold 
as of both december  and december   million at par value  respectively  of our investments was comprised of auction rate securities 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process  which allows holders to sell their notes  and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
over the past three years we have experienced failed auctions on our auction rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and continue to reset the next auction date every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term and due to our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity  the auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at both december  and december  
table of contents our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods during the auction process  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under fasb authoritative guidance 
over the past three years  the auction events for most of these instruments failed and  therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
these analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the security  the creditworthiness of the issuer  the timing of the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which is limited at this time 
as a result  we classified these instruments as level unobservable inputs within our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we recorded a cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   we recorded a cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during   of our auction rate securities were called by the issuer at par value 
we believe that the temporary declines in fair value are primarily due to liquidity concerns and are not due to the creditworthiness of the remaining underlying assets  because the majority of the underlying securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
however  if at any time in the future a determination that a valuation adjustment is other than temporary  we will record a charge to earnings in the period of determination 
our holdings of auction rate securities at par value represented approximately of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance as of each of december  and december   which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value or to be refinanced by the issuer 
because we believe that the decline in fair value deemed to be temporary is primarily due to liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our estimate and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will continue to re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 
we have an operating lease covering our corporate office facility that expires in february the company has the option to terminate the lease as of the last date of each month between august  and february   on nine month s prior written notice 
we also have several operating leases related to offices in the united states and foreign countries 
the expiration dates for these leases range from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as of december  year ending december  thereafter in addition  as of december   our liability for uncertain tax positions totaled million 
due to the uncertainty relating to the timing of future payments  such amounts are not presented in the above schedule 
we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and our expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty

off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes  accounting for share based payments  goodwill and other intangible assets  software development costs  and fair value measurements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract  a customer purchase order  and or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
product fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers with extended payment terms during the year ended december when a customer purchases our integrated solutions and or licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual optional maintenance renewal rate 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which receivables are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider i historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  vii actual cash collections on our accounts receivables and viii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
when determining the appropriate allowance for uncollectable accounts and returns each period  the actual customer collections of outstanding account receivable balances impact the required allowance for returns 
due to cash collections of previously reserved accounts receivable balances during the year ended december   we recorded a net expense of approximately million as compared with a net expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts are included within our consolidated statement of operations in each respective year 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  we regularly evaluate our ability to recover deferred tax assets  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in determining the period in which related tax benefits are realized for financial reporting purposes  excess share based compensation deductions included in net operating losses are realized after regular net operating losses are exhausted 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return  should be recorded in the financial statements 
pursuant to the authoritative guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it meets the more likely than not threshold that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in addition  the authoritative guidance addresses de recognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods  and also requires increased disclosures 
accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for share based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation 

table of contents we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
the expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise 
the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued has been determined pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experience  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december   and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on goodwill and other intangibles 
the authoritative guidance requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each of our fiscal years 
as of each of december  and december   we had million of goodwill 
as of each of december  and december   we had million and million net of amortization  respectively  of other identifiable intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often if a trigger event occurs 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of the reporting unit 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset a group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
as of december  and december   we did not record any impairment charges on either our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
software development costs 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for software development costs in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of software development costs  net of amortization 
the authoritative guidance requires that the costs associated with the development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates 
if other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility  the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected 
annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product  generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers 
software development costs are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we amortize software development costs using the straight line method 

table of contents fair value measurement 
as discussed further in note fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements  we determine fair value measurements of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements and disclosures 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of our marketable securities  specifically our debt instruments  can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in the current financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
the fasb authoritative guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  issuer credit ratings  non binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data  model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
these level instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level instruments 
level instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of our marketable debt instruments classified as level are valued using an undiscounted cash flow analysis  a non binding market consensus price and or a non binding broker quote  all of which we corroborate with unobservable data 
non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers 
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs  including non binding and binding broker quotes  observable market prices for identical and or similar securities  and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs  and to a lesser degree non observable market inputs 
adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes  and classified as level  were not significant as of december  and december other than temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available for sale debt instruments  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations
