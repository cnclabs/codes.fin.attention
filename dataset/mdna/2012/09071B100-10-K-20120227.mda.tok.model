item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bioclinica provides integrated clinical research technology solutions to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device companies and other organizations such as contract research organizations  or cros  engaged in global clinical studies 
our products and services include medical image management  electronic image transport and archive solutions  electronic data capture  clinical data management  interactive voice and web response  clinical trial supply forecasting tools and clinical trial management software solutions 
by supplying enterprise class software and hosted solutions accompanied by expert services to fully utilize these tools  we believe that our offerings provide our clients  large and small  improved speed and efficiency in the execution of clinical studies  with reduced clinical and business risk 
market for our services our vision is to build critical mass in the complementary disciplines of clinical research related to data collection and processing especially those which can benefit from our information technology products and support services and to integrate them in ways that yield efficiency and value for our clients 
our goal is to provide demonstrable benefits to sponsor clients through this strategy  that is  faster and less expensive drug development 
we believe that the outsourcing of these services should continue to increase in the future because of increased pressure on clients  including factors such as the need to more tightly manage costs  capacity limitations  reductions in marketing exclusivity periods  the desire to reduce development time  increased globalization of clinical trials  productivity challenges  imminent patent expirations and more stringent regulation 
we believe these trends will continue to create opportunities for companies like bioclinica that are focused on improving the efficiency of drug and medical device development 
sales and backlog our sales cycle  referring to the period from the presentation by us to a potential client to the engagement of us by such client  has historically ranged from three to months 
in addition  the contracts under which we perform services typically cover a period of three months to seven years  and the volume and type of services performed by us generally vary during the course of a project 
we cannot assure you that our project revenues will be at levels sufficient to maintain profitability 
our contracted committed backlog  referred to as backlog  is the expected service revenue that remains to be earned and recognized on both signed and verbally agreed to contracts 
in addition  our costs may increase to service our increased backlog 
our backlog as of december  was million  compared to million at december  changes in backlog for the period reflect the net effect of new contract signings  addendums  cancellations  expansions  and reductions in scope of existing projects  all of which impacted our backlog at december  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination by our clients at any time 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
the duration of the projects included in our backlog range from less than three months to months 
we do not believe that backlog is a reliable predictor of future results because service revenues may be 
table of contents incurred in a given period on contracts that were not included in the previous reporting period s backlog and or contract cancellations or project delays may occur in a given period on contracts that were included in the previous reporting period s backlog 
acquisitions and dispositions on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held transenda international  llc  or transenda 
headquartered in bellevue  wa  transenda was a provider of ctms solutions 
transenda s suite of web based  office smart ctms solutions create efficiencies for trial operations through interoperability with microsoft office tools 
the ctms solutions enable our clients to have their applications work together instead of being locked into a single suite vendor and serves as the foundation for operational data interchange among different software applications 
this facilitates easier access to data with a consistent user interface and reduces training costs 
with this acquisition  we enhanced our ability to serve customers throughout the clinical research process with technologies that include improved efficiencies by reducing study durations and costs through integrated operational management 
the acquisition was made pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  dated march   by and between bioclinica and transenda  or the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we purchased and acquired from transenda all right  title and interest of transenda in and to the purchased assets as defined in the purchase agreement and assumed the assumed liabilities as defined in the purchase agreement of transenda 
as consideration for the purchased assets and assumed liabilities  we paid  shares of common stock  par value per share  of the company  valued at a volume weighted average price per share equal to  and subject to a post closing adjustment based on the final closing net working capital as defined in the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  of the aggregate consideration is to be held in escrow to cover any potential indemnification claims under the purchase agreement for a period of months following the closing date as defined in the purchase agreement  which was subsequently released 
as part of the purchase agreement  transenda agreed not to directly or indirectly offer  sell  contract to sell  pledge  grant any option to purchase  make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of bioclinica s common stock received pursuant to the purchase agreement for a period beginning on the date the purchase agreement was executed and continuing to and including the date months after such date 
we recorded the fair value of the acquisition of  based on our market value of on march   the date of acquisition 
on september   bioclinica acquired substantially all of the assets of tourtellotte solutions  inc  or tourtellotte 
tourtellotte provided software applications and consulting services which support clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry 
the purchase price for tourtellotte was million in cash 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we agreed to pay up to an additional million in cash and  shares of our common stock based upon achieving certain milestones  which include certain product development and revenue targets  hereinafter referred to as the earn out 
in december  pursuant to obtaining certain milestones  we paid to the sellers of tourtellotte  million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
at december   the fair value of the remaining cash earn out of million has been recorded as a liability 
we used cash from operations to fund the cash purchase price for tourtellotte 
on august   bioclinica acquired the cardionow unit of agfa healthcare  or cardionow 
cardionow has developed a web based system for the secure transmission of medical cardiac images 
the software was specifically developed for and marketed to the invasive cardiology departments of hospitals within the united states 
bioclinica integrated and enhanced the cardionow software and service to offer our clients a 
table of contents streamlined electronic transport solution to facilitate the blinding  sharing  tracking and archiving of medical images for multi center clinical trials as part of our suite of imaging services

forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by  among other things  the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  our statements regarding our projected financial results  the demand for our services and technologies  growing recognition for the use of independent medical image review services  trends toward the outsourcing of imaging services in clinical trials  realized return from our marketing efforts  increased use of digital medical images in clinical trials  integration of our acquired companies and businesses  expansion into new business segments  the success of any potential acquisitions and the integration of current acquisitions  and the level of our backlog are examples of such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the timing of revenues due to the variability in size  scope and duration of projects  estimates made by management with respect to our critical accounting policies  regulatory delays  clinical study results which lead to reductions or cancellations of projects and other factors  including general economic conditions and regulatory developments  not within our control 
the factors discussed in this form k and expressed from time to time in our filings with the sec could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such statements 
the forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this filing  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the proportional performance method of accounting for fixed service contracts  accounting for acquisitions and the related goodwill and intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  income taxes and fair value accounting for stock based compensation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue 
service revenues are recognized over the contractual term of our customer contracts using the proportional performance method 
service revenues are first recognized when we have a signed contract from a customer which i contain fixed or determinable fees  ii collectability of such fees is reasonably assured  and iii services are performed 
any change to recognized service revenue as a result of revisions to estimated total hours are recognized in the period the estimate changes 
we enter into service contracts that contain fixed or determinable fees 
the fees in the contracts are based on the scope of work we are contracted to perform  there are unitized fees per service and fixed fees with a total estimated for the contract based upon the estimated unitized service expected to be performed  as well as the service to be delivered under the fixed fee component of the contract 
the units are estimated based on the information provided by the customer  and we bill the customer for actual units completed in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
we  at the request of our clients  directly contract with and pay independent radiologists  referred to as readers  who review the client s imaging data as part of the clinical trial 
the costs of the readers and other out of pocket expenses are reimbursed to us and recognized gross as reimbursement revenues 
we also enter into software license contracts that permit the customer to use our software products at its site 
generally  these contracts are multiple element arrangements since they usually provide for professional services and ongoing software maintenance 
in these instances  license fees are recognized upon the signing of the contract and delivery of the software if the license fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and there is sufficient vendor specific evidence of the fair value of each undelivered element 
revenue for the software maintenance is recognized over the duration of the maintenance period 
when contracts include both professional services and software and require a significant amount of program modification or customization  installation  systems integration or related services  the professional services and license revenue is recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion  measured in the manner described above 
changes in the estimated costs or hours to complete the contract and losses  if any  are reflected in the period during which the change or loss becomes known 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually at december st or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of 
table of contents impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting level unit  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
bioclinica has one operating segment  clinical trial services  which is a single reporting unit 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  tax rates  capital spending  and working capital changes 
we consider market participant assumptions in estimating fair value of the reporting unit 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
at december   we conducted the required annual test of impairment 
in  the estimated fair values of the clinical trial services reporting unit was in excess of its carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
capitalized software development 
we capitalize development costs for an internal use software project once the preliminary project stage is completed  we have committed to fund the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended 
we cease capitalization at such time as the computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
the determination that a software project is eligible for capitalization and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by us with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
software development costs related to products that will be sold  leased or marketed to be operated by customers on their equipment and premises are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of design and development costs of new products and significant enhancements to existing products incurred before the establishment of technological feasibility 
recoverable costs incurred subsequent to technological feasibility of new products and enhancements to existing products as well as costs associated with purchased software and software obtained through business acquisitions are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related products  generally five to ten years average life is five years  using the straight line method or the ratio of current revenue to current and anticipated revenue from such software  whichever provides the greater amortization 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we consider our future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that  in the future  we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged  thereby decreasing net income in the period such determination was made 
we recognize 
table of contents contingent liabilities for any tax related exposures when those exposures are more likely than not to occur 
foreign currency risks our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially increase the operating costs of our facilities in the netherlands and france  which are euro denominated 
a ten percent increase or decrease in the euro to us dollar spot exchange rate would result in a change of  and  to our net asset position  at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  certain of our contracts are denominated in foreign currency 
we believe that any adverse fluctuation in the foreign currency markets relating to these costs will not result in any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event we derive a greater portion of our service revenues from international operations  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our foreign currency financial assets and liabilities primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  prepaid expenses  fixed assets  trade payables and accrued expenses 
we were in a net asset position at december  and december  an increase in the exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  if we were in a net liability position  a decrease in the exchange rate would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure when and as appropriate to mitigate the adverse impact of fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december  and  there are no outstanding derivative positions

recently issued accounting statements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement asu  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal and should be applied prospectively 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
the issuance of asu is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu supersedes the presentation options in asc topic and facilitates convergence of us gaap and ifrs by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu is effective for interim periods and years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we early adopted asu and this did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that allows an entity to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
under this guidance  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
in addition  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance will be effective for bioclinica s goodwill impairment tests performed after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in high quality financial instruments  comprised of savings accounts  certificate of deposits and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
foreign currency risk under our current foreign exchange rate risk management policy  we monitor our exposure to variability in our cash flows resulting from the euro denominated costs for our netherlands and france subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had purchased monthly euro call options in prior years and may purchase them in the future to hedge against this exposure 
during the year ended december  and  we did not purchase any euro call options  because our foreign currency needs were generally met by the cash flow generated by our euro denominated contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding derivative positions 
upon expiration or ineffectiveness of any derivatives  we would record a gain or loss from such derivatives that are deferred in stockholders equity to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income based on the nature of the underlying cash flow hedged
