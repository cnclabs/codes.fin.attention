item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have no material operations and conduct no business on our own other than owning our subsidiaries  carolina bank and carolina capital trust  and because carolina capital trust has no operations other than the issuance of its trust preferred securities  the discussion contained in this management s discussion and analysis concerns primarily the business of carolina bank 
carolina bank also owns two limited liability companies for the purpose of holding foreclosed real estate  the assets and operations of which are consolidated into carolina bank and included herein 
for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank are collectively referred to herein as we  our  or us  unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations and business 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information available at the time these statements and disclosures were prepared 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expected include the following general economic conditions may deteriorate and negatively impact the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and our depositors to maintain balances 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
competitive pressures among financial institutions may increase 
legislative or regulatory changes  including changes in accounting standards  may adversely affect the businesses in which we are engaged 
new products developed and new methods of delivering products could result in a reduction in our business and income 
increases in interest rates  increases in warranty losses  or changes in the securitization of mortgages could negatively impact our mortgage banking income 
adverse changes may occur in the securities market 
local  state or federal taxing authorities may take tax positions that are adverse to us 
unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on our operations or on the willingness of our customers to access our financial services 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include our accounting for the allowance for loan losses 
our accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgment 
these estimates are based on our opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in our consolidated financial condition or consolidated financial results of operations 
the methodology we employ to determine the allowance for loan losses involves a number of assumptions and estimates about uncertain matters 
we periodically review our assumptions and methodology 
securities available for sale  certain mortgage loans held for sale  derivative assets  and derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
from time to time  certain assets  consisting primarily of other real estate owned and impaired loans  may be recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically are a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a write down occurring during the period 
for example  if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis  it is considered to be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment 
in periods where there is no adjustment  the asset is generally not considered to be at fair value 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair value involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
comparison of financial condition assets 
our total assets decreased by million or from million at december   to million at december  during  interest bearing deposits with banks decreased million  and loans held for sale increased by million due to strong originations by our mortgage loan division and slower funding of loan sales by investors during the fourth quarter of loans held for investment decreased by million or during  from declining loan originations  primarily construction and development loans  loan charge offs  and repossessions 
carolina bank  which makes both commercial and retail loans  experienced slow loan demand in and due to declining economic conditions in its primary lending markets  guilford  randolph  alamance  and forsyth counties  north carolina 
our compounded annual growth rate for the five years ending december  for loans held for investment and assets was and  respectively 
liabilities 
total liabilities decreased by million or from million at december   to million at december  deposits decreased by million  or  during as non interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased while time deposits declined 
the decline in deposits in was a result of pricing and the lack of asset growth which would require additional liquidity 
the compounded annual growth rate for the five years ending december  for deposits was 
over the long term  we plan to continue our efforts to gain deposits through quality service  convenient locations  and competitive pricing 
while deposit growth is an ongoing goal  wholesale sources of funding such as federal home loan bank advances and repurchase borrowings  may be utilized where cost beneficial and when necessary to meet liquidity requirements 
federal home loan bank advances decreased slightly during stockholders equity 
our total stockholders equity increased million at december  to million from million at december   primarily from net income available to common shareholders of million realized in and from an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million primarily related to unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio 
asset quality our non performing assets  composed of foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets  non accrual loans and non performing restructured loans  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  non performing assets  as a percentage of total assets  were and at december  and  respectively 
there were million and million in loans days or more past due and still accruing interest at december  and  respectively 
foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
net loan charge offs totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impaired but still performing loans increased to million at december  from million at december  in general  loans are impaired when  based on current information and events  collection of all contractual amounts due is not probable 
the decrease in non performing assets in from resulted from success in disposing of problem loans and real estate and from a more accommodative approach toward struggling borrowers as evidenced by the sharp increase in performing troubled debt restructurings to million at december  from million at december  the economic conditions in our primary markets in north carolina continued to be stressed during and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in north carolina was in december and in december our primary lending market in the piedmont triad experienced slightly higher unemployment rates than the north carolina average in the past two years 
the deteriorating economic conditions in our markets have negatively impacted our borrowers  particularly real estate developers and builders 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses our ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
our primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and cash flows generated from operations 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased from banks and advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
carolina bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of investments 
cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  and investment securities available for sale are the primary liquid assets of carolina bank 
we regularly monitor carolina bank s liquidity position to ensure its liquidity is sufficient to meet its needs 
during  we decreased our levels of short term liquidity and investment securities to fund the increased volume of residential mortgage loans that are held for sale 
since december   short term liquidity has increased as loans held for sale have declined 
we have also increased our secondary sources of liquidity during and as our credit availability for additional advances from the federal home loan bank and available discount borrowings from the federal reserve exceeded million at december  we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking regulatory agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
as of december  and  our levels of capital exceeded all applicable published regulatory requirements 
carolina bank increased tier capital to average assets to in through earnings and moderate asset growth in response to regulatory requests 
tier capital to average assets was for carolina bank at december  due to our growth in recent years  the recent difficult economic environment  increased regulatory capital requirements  and our anticipation of continued growth  we issued million in preferred stock to the united states treasury under the capital purchase program in january to increase our capital which could further support future growth and assist us in meeting future regulatory capital requirements 
results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we had net income of million and a net loss of million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
net income available to common stockholders was million or per diluted share  for compared to a net loss allocable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  in net income loss available allocable to common stockholders represents net income loss less the preferred stock dividends and related discount accretion 
the increase in net income in was primarily due to a lower provision for loan losses and a decline in impairments of other real estate owned 
net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities  was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
non interest income  principally service charges and fees  mortgage banking income  increase in cash value of life insurance  plus gain on sale of investments amounted to million in and million in mortgage banking income declined approximately million  or  during due to higher interest rates and fewer originations in early our provision for loan losses was million and million in and  respectively 
lower loan charge offs  decreased reserves on impaired loans  and a change in the mix of loans resulted in a decrease in the provision for loan losses in we incurred non interest expense of million in and million in the decrease in non interest expense of million or was largely the result of decreased impairments of other real estate owned 
income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in was due to net income in compared to a net loss in the commercial retail bank segment reported net income of million compared to a million loss in  primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and higher impairments in the period 
our mortgage division reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in due to declining mortgage originations  increased regulatory costs  and lower profit margins on loans sold during net interest income 
net interest income is the amount of interest earned on interest earning assets such as loans  investments  and interest earning deposits in other financial institutions less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities such as interest bearing deposits and borrowed money 
net interest income is the principal source of our earnings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  competition  and the volumes and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for the year ended december   net interest income increased by million or to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable to a higher net yield on interest earning assets which was partially offset by a decline in average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets were approximately million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was due to decreased loan demand and was partially planned in order to improve capital ratios 
the net yield on average interest earning assets was in and in the interest rate spread was in and in the increase in the net yield on interest earning assets and the interest rate spread in resulted from a greater drop in the cost of deposits and other borrowings than the drop in rates earned on interest earning assets

rate volume analysis of net interest income 
the effect of changes in average balances volume and rates on interest income  interest expense and net interest income for the period indicated is shown below

the increase of million in average non interest bearing demand deposits in also had a positive impact on net interest income in provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses  established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses  allows for known and expected loan losses in our loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses decreased in to million from million in  primarily because of lower specific allowances required on impaired loans and fewer charge offs in declining real estate values and tepid demand for new real estate negatively impacted the ability of many of our borrowers to make loan payments in and resulting in significant increases in loan charge offs  non performing loans  and impaired loans 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our estimate as to the amount required to maintain an allowance adequate enough to provide for known and expected losses 
we consider  among other things  nonperforming loans  impaired loans  delinquencies  collateral values  loss trends  and general economic conditions when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans and million or of loans at december  and  respectively 
the increased provision for loan losses in primarily resulted from higher charge offs of impaired loans and the impact of the higher charge offs on the loss trends that are used to calculate the allowance on the non impaired loans 
charge offs  net of recoveries  were million and million during and  respectively

non interest income consists principally of service charges and fees  mortgage banking income  investment services income  increase in cash value of life insurance  gain on sale of investments  and repossessed asset gains losses 
non interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
service charges increased in to million  primarily from an increase in commercial services and increased non sufficient funds fees 
mortgage banking income  which represents fees earned from the origination and sale of mortgage loans  declined to million in from million in due to a decrease in the profit margin on loan sales and a small decrease in originations 
the mortgage division originates loans through other banks and brokers in addition to its own retail loan officers and sells the loans to investors 
approximately of the mortgage banking income in was generated by our retail mortgage loan officers 
other non interest income included million from the increase in cash value of life insurance in both and gains on the sale of investments of million in and million in and repossessed asset losses of million in and are also included in non interest income 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
salaries and employee benefits increased to million in from million in  primarily from expansion of our mortgage division and from increased benefit costs 
the number of full time equivalent employees rose to at december  from at the end of impairment charges on repossessed assets decreased to million in from million in because real estate prices values declined less in than in repossessed asset expenses were million in and million in  reflecting an elevated level of investment in repossessed property due to the declining real estate market experienced in recent years 
other non interest expense includes warranty expenses of million in and million in  related to providing for claims  both real and estimated  that might arise from borrower fraud or underwriting errors in our mortgage division 
four warranty claims totaling million have been incurred since establishment of the mortgage division in  and the current liability to fund future claims is million at december  in addition  four loans with principal balances of million have been repurchased and marked to market of million through a charge against income 
income taxes 
income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes in  compared to an income tax benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the more favorable tax rate in is primarily due to a higher percentage of non taxable income from municipal securities and from the increase in cash value of life insurance as a percentage of net income before income taxes and from larger tax credits in financial condition 
total assets were million at december   a decrease of from total assets of million at december  most categories of assets decreased in except loans held for sale which increased due to increased lending and slower processing of loans sold in the fourth quarter of deposits declined as we adjusted our pricing to match our asset funding needs 
we periodically utilize wholesale deposit sources such as broker deposits and deposits from other depository institutions on a limited basis to meet specific asset liability management needs or to realize substantially lower funding costs 
we had approximately million and million in deposits from other depository institutions and million and million of brokered deposits at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in these sources of deposits in was planned in an effort to better match our liquidity needs and to improve our capital ratios through asset reduction 
much of our asset decline in occurred in loans held for investment and interest bearing deposits with banks which together funded much of the million increase in loans held for sale 
interest bearing deposits with banks of million primarily represent overnight deposits with the federal reserve and federal home loan bank and declined million in investment securities declined million 
loans held for investment decreased million  or  to million at december   due to loan pay offs  loan charge offs  and repossessions of assets from non performing loans 
prior to  we experienced double digit growth in loans held for investment  but commercial and construction loan demand weakened in and as a result of declining real estate prices and weak economic growth 
we believe our targeted marketing efforts  experienced lenders  local decision making  and emphasis on personal relationships and superior customer service have been key drivers of our loan growth in prior years  however  our emphasis on stronger risk management practices and a weak economy limited growth in and approximately of our loans at december  were secured by some form of real estate 
at december   loans secured by residential properties in the form of home equity lines and closed end loans comprised of our loan portfolio while construction development loans and commercial real estate loans comprised and of our loan portfolio  respectively 
another of our loan portfolio were commercial and industrial loans with the balance in consumer and other loans 
asset quality is a primary concern of our credit administration 
a thorough credit analysis is made of most loans before origination 
experienced lenders and a credit administrator review the loans structure including terms  rate  collateral and repayment sources in addition to adherence to our lending policy 
on an ongoing basis  a risk rating program and other credit administration tools are utilized to monitor loans and overall asset quality 
non performing loans amounted to approximately million  or of loans outstanding  and million  or of loans outstanding  at december  and  respectively 
our allowance for loan losses was and of loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
net loan charge offs were and of average loans during and  respectively 
investment securities declined to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of 
approximately million in investment securities were sold in to reduce risk in municipal securities and to minimize additional fdic insurance assessments related to corporate securities 
our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of mortgage backed securities issued by the us government and government sponsored entities  municipal securities  and corporate securities 
approximately of the investment securities at december  were classified as available for sale and were recorded at market value 
changes in market value are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not engage in the practice of trading securities 
other real estate owned which consists of foreclosed real estate declined million  or to million at december  from million at december  as we have more aggressively marketed properties during we opened for business in november and have not paid any cash dividends to our stockholders

we have established loan and credit policies designed to control both the types and amounts of risks assumed and to ultimately minimize credit losses 
such policies include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of certain real estate collateral  problem loan management practices and collection procedures  and non accrual and charge off guidelines 
loans secured by real estate mortgages comprised and of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
residential real estate loans consist mainly of first and second mortgages on single family homes 
loan to value ratios for these loans are generally limited to for second mortgages and for first mortgages  unless private mortgage insurance is obtained 
commercial real estate loans are secured by business and commercial properties with loan to value ratios generally limited to 
the repayment of both residential and commercial real estate loans is dependent primarily on the income and cash flows of the borrowers with the real estate serving as a secondary source of repayment 
real estate construction loans generally consist of financing of commercial real estate projects and some one to four family dwellings 
usually the loan to cost ratios are limited to  and permanent financing commitments are generally required prior to advancing loan proceeds 
commercial and industrial loans primarily represent loans to businesses and may be made on either a secured or unsecured basis 
commercial lending involves risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and the debt service capacity of a business can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
to manage this risk  initial and continuing financial analysis of a borrower s financial information is generally required 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by direct charges to operating expense 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management has determined that such loans have become uncollectible  or in the case of non performing real estate loans  when updated appraisals indicate a loss in value 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
our allowance for loan losses is composed of two parts  a specific portion related to impaired loans and a general section related to loans that are not impaired 
loans are impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms will not be collected 
our impaired loans increased to million at december  from million at december  impaired loans primarily increased in because performing troubled debt restructurings increased million from million at december  to million at december  most of these new troubled debt restructurings did not require any specific allowances for loan losses 
the specific portion of our allowance for loan losses  which relates to impaired loans  decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decline in the specific portion of our allowance relates to the timing of write offs on real estate loans 
at december   there were million allowances on impaired real estate loans that were later charged off in while there were only million of allowances on impaired real estate loans at december  the general allowance  the difference between our allowance for loan losses and the specific portion of the allowance for loan losses  increased to million at december  from million at december  these allowances apply to performing loans and were determined by applying estimated loss ratios inherent in the loan portfolio  ranging from 
on multifamily loans to on construction and development loans  to categories of performing loans at each period end 
the general section of our allowance also includes a qualitative component which is calculated based on nine environmental factors such as the changes in economic and business conditions that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio and changes in the value of collateral dependent loans 
qualitative factors increased by and to million at december  as regulators recommended that qualitative factors be re emphasized in after a recommendation to de emphasize qualitative factors in the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december  and  compared with the percent of loans in the applicable categories of total loans

when a loan is past due days as to interest or principal or there is serious doubt as to collectability  the accrual of interest is generally discontinued unless the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to assure the collection of the principal balance and accrued interest 
a non accrual loan is not returned to accrual status unless principal and interest are current and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to continue making payments as agreed

construction and land development loans have been particularly affected by the economic downturn as demand for new housing or developed property has declined from prior years 
our construction and land development loans had the highest level of charge offs in and and these loans have declined substantially during due to the economic downturn 
during  we increased our restructuring of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to improve the likelihood of repayment in full under the modified terms 
performing restructured loans increased to million at december  from million at december  the primary reason for the increase in our impaired loans during was that troubled debt restructured loans are classified as impaired loans under current accounting principles

the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more at december  and is presented below 
such deposits may be more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other deposits 
our deposit focus in centered on increasing lower cost demand accounts and lowering the pricing on time deposits to improve our net interest income which resulted in a decline in time deposits 
certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more at december  remaining maturity in thousands three months or less   over three through six months   over six through twelve months   over twelve months   interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of re pricing assets compared to liabilities and is a part of asset liability management 
it is the objective of interest rate sensitivity management to generate stable growth in net interest income  and to control the risks associated with interest rate movements 
we measure interest rate risk by using simulation analysis 
prior to  simulation analysis indicated  in the absence of growth or changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  our net interest income generally increased when short term interest rates rose and declined when short term interest rates fell 
in late  we set our carolina bank prime at when the wall street journal prime declined to with the expectation that the carolina bank prime would not rise again until the wall street journal prime exceeded 
approximately of our loans held for investment  or million at december   adjust with the carolina bank prime 
we also implemented floors on a number of our variable rate loans which benefits our loan yields in a very low rate environment 
our net yield on average interest earning assets increased to in from in because deposit yields declined more than asset yields 
our simulation analysis indicates that our net interest margin will decline approximately  if interest rates immediately rise and will not begin to rise until interest rates rise between and 
the delay in adjusting our loans tied to the carolina bank prime or at floors is the major reason for the potential decline in net interest income as the wall street journal prime increases 
the table below reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their re pricing or maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are reflected at their contractual maturity date and variable rate loans are reflected when the loans may be re priced contractually  except variable loans that have reached their floors are treated as fixed rate loans 
investments in restricted and unrestricted stocks are excluded from the presentation 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as interest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits  are reflected in the earliest re pricing interval due to contractual arrangements which give the bank the opportunity to vary rates paid on these deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions

carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy standards 
under these standards  financial institutions are required to maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets and average total assets 
carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank exceeded all minimum published capital requirements  and carolina bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized at december  and included in the regulatory capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary is million in junior subordinated debentures which has been primarily reinvested in the bank 
another million in junior subordinated debentures issued by carolina bank in is included in the regulatory capital of the bank and the consolidated capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary 
on january  we issued million in preferred stock to the united states treasury under the capital purchase program to help support future growth 
the preferred stock is included in the consolidated capital of carolina bank holdings  inc and subsidiary  and million of this capital  which was reinvested in the bank  is included in the bank s capital 
during  carolina bank agreed to increase its tier capital to average assets to and to not pay any cash dividends or bonuses without the prior written consent of the supervisory authorities 
carolina bank believes compliance with these additional terms was met in carolina bank holdings  inc also agreed to obtain the written approval of the federal reserve before declaring or paying any dividend  common or preferred  or making any payments on trust preferred securities 
carolina bank holdings  inc paid dividends on its preferred stock and interest on its trust preferred securities during the first half of  but its requests to make these payments were denied in the last half of no common stock dividends are anticipated in the near future 
inflation 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  our performance is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not necessarily be the same
