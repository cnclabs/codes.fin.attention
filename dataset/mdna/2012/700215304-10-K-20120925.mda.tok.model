overview park city group  inc the company is a software as a service saas provider that brings unique visibility to the consumer goods supply chain  delivering actionable information that ensures product is on the shelf when the consumer expects it 
our service increases our customers sales and profitability while enabling lower inventory levels for both retailers and their suppliers 
our services are delivered principally though proprietary software products designed  developed  marketed and supported by the company 
these products are designed to facilitate improved business processes among all key constituents in the supply chain  starting with the retailer and moving back to suppliers and eventually raw material providers 
in addition  the company has built a consulting practice for business process improvement that centers around the company s proprietary software products and through establishment of a neutral and trusted third party relationship between retailers and suppliers 
the principal markets for the company s products are multi store retail and convenience store chains  branded food manufacturers  suppliers and distributors and manufacturing companies 

table of contents historically  the company offered applications and related maintenance contracts to new customers for a one time  non recurring up front license fee 
although not completely abandoning the license fee and maintenance model  since the acquisition of prescient applied intelligience  inc prescient in january  the company has focused its strategic initiatives and resources to marketing and selling prospective customers a subscription for its product offerings 
in support of this strategic shift toward a subscription based model  the company has scaled its contracting process  streamlined its customer on boarding and implemented a financial package that integrates multiple systems in an automated fashion 
as a result  subscription based revenue has grown from  for the fiscal year to million this year 
during that same period our revenue has transitioned from a subscription revenue and license and other revenue basis to subscription revenue and license and other revenue basis 
recent developments repositraktm on february  the company announced a partnership with levitt partners  an internationally known health care and food safety consulting firm 
the company s association with levitt partners resulted in the formation of global supply  which will provide a targeted solution for improving supply chain visibility for food and drug safety 
the solution  respositraktm  is powered by the company s technology and was developed in response to the passage of the food safety and modernization act in january of respositraktm enables grocery  supermarkets  packaged goods manufacturers  food processing facilities  drug stores and drug manufacturers  as well as logistics partners  to track and trace products and components to products throughout the food  drug and dietary supplement supply chains 
in the event of a product recall  the solution quickly identifies the supply chain path taken by the recalled product or product component  and allows for the removal of affected products in a matter of minutes  rather than weeks 
additionally  repositraktm reduces risk of further contamination in the supply chain by identifying backward chaining sources and forward chaining recipients of affected products in near real time 
on august   the company announced that global supply had begun the first two implementations of repositraktm at a global grocery retailer and a major grocery wholesaler 
cvs pharmacy  inc on july   the company announced a three year service agreement to provide selected scan based trading services to cvs through may the agreement reflects the company s focus on increasing the number of retailers that use its software on a subscription basis  and marks the company s progress towards contracting with major retailers outside of the grocery industry 
the company expects the subscription revenue potential generated from these relationships to be significantly larger than any of the company s existing client hubs within the grocery industry 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal refer to the fiscal year ended june  sources of revenue the company derives revenue from four sources subscription fees  hosting  premium support and maintenance service fees beyond the standard services offered  license fees  and professional services consisting of development services  consulting  training and education 
subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of connections between suppliers and retailers  the number of stores and sku s 
subscription revenue contains arrangements with customers accessing our applications  which includes the use of the application  application and data hosting  subscription based maintenance of the application and standard support included with the subscription 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data  which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data through a secure internet connection 
premium support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis beyond what is offered with our basic subscription package 
license arrangements are a perpetual license 
software license maintenance agreements are typically annual contracts with customers that are paid in advance or according to terms specified in the contract 
this provides the customer access to new software enhancements  maintenance releases  patches  updates and technical support personnel 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from development  consulting  education and training 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
consulting  education and training include implementation and best practices consulting 
our professional services fees are more frequently billed on a fixed price fixed scope  but may also be billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software and subscription arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 

table of contents critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we commenced operations in the software development and professional services business during the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience of operations and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  will affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of the company s net deferred income tax assets  the company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to realize the benefit of these assets 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit in the company s statements of operations 
management evaluates whether or not to realize the deferred income tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance quarterly 
goodwill and other long lived asset valuations goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
management reviews the long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
management evaluates  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
economic useful lives of long lived assets are assessed and adjusted as circumstances dictate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement beginning on the commencement dates of each agreement or when revenue recognition conditions are satisfied 
for a fee  subscriptions provide the customer with access to the software and data over the internet  or on demand  and provide technical support services and software upgrades when and if available 
under subscriptions  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and such arrangements are considered service contracts 
accordingly  we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement and professional services are recognized as incurred based on their relative fair values 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contract term 
when subscription service is paid in advance  deferred revenue is recognized and revenue is recorded ratably over the term as services are consumed 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the applicable agreement 
hosting  premium support and maintenance service revenue is derived from services beyond the basic services provided in standard arrangements 
we recognize hosting  premium service and maintenance revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contact or when revenue recognition conditions are satisfied 
instances where hosting  premium support or maintenance service is paid in advance  deferred revenue is recognized and revenue is recording ratably over the term as services are consumed 
professional services revenue consists primarily of fees associated with application and data integration  data cleansing  business process re engineering  change management and education and training services 
fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services and performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 

table of contents we also sell software licenses 
for software license sales  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
licenses generally include multiple elements that are delivered up front or over time 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the hosting and support elements is based on the price charged at renewal when sold separately  and the license element is recognized into revenue upon delivery 
the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
stock based compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company records compensation expense on a straight line basis 
the fair value of options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
capitalization of software development costs the company accounts for research costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly after a working prototype is complete and meets or exceeds design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have been and will continue to be capitalized until such time as when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue and results of operation  liquidity or capital expenditures 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and revenue fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent subscription other revenues total revenue during the fiscal year ended june   the company had total revenue of  when compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease 
this  decrease in total revenue was principally due to a decrease in other revenues of  as more particularly described below 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in subscription revenue 
while the company experienced a decrease in total revenue in the most recently completed fiscal year when compared to the fiscal year ended june   management believes that the company s strategy of pursuing contracts with suppliers spokes to connect to retail customers hubs that have been added in the most recently completed fiscal year  including the recently announced service agreement with cvs pharmacy  inc  should result in increased revenue during the fiscal year ending june   and in subsequent periods 
subscription revenue subscription revenue was  and  in and respectively  an increase of 
this  increase in the year ended june  when compared with the year ended june  was principally due to the increase of subscription customers added to the company s customer base which contributed approximately  in new subscription revenue and a  increase attributable to the growth of existing retailer and supplier subscriptions 
the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  resulting from the non renewal of existing clients  including the non renewal of a significant retail client and related connections in january the company continues to focus its strategic initiatives on increasing the number of retailers  suppliers and manufacturers that use its software on a subscription basis 
however  while management believes that marketing its suite of software solutions as a renewable and recurring subscription is an effective strategy  it cannot be assured that subscribers will renew the service at the same level in future years  propagate services to new categories or recognize the need for expanding the service offering of the company s suite of actionable products and services 

table of contents other revenue other revenue was  and  in and respectively  a decrease of 
this  decrease in the year ended june  when compared with the year ended june  was principally due to the non renewal of maintenance contracts  partially offset by increases to existing contracts resulting in a net reduction of maintenance revenue of approximately  a decrease in license revenue of  and a decrease in professional service revenue of  while these other sources of revenue will continue in future periods  management s focus on recurring subscription based revenue will cause license  maintenance and consulting services to fluctuate and be difficult to predict 
cost of revenue and product support fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cost of revenue and product support percent of total revenue cost of revenue and product support was  or of total revenue  and  or of total revenue for the years ended june  and  respectively  a increase 
this increase of  for the year ended june  when compared with the same period ended june  is principally due to i a  increase in head count related expense  increased stock compensation  an increase in benefit costs  and the capitalization of software development costs in the prior year  ii a  increase in the use of outside consultants and contractors and iii a  increase from an expansion of our data center 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease related to network communication costs  hardware and software maintenance and support contracts  travel and related expenditures 
sales and marketing expense fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent sales and marketing percent of total revenue the company s sales and marketing expense was  or of total revenue  and  or of total revenue  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  a decrease 
this  decrease over the previous year was primarily the result of i a decrease of approximately  in salary  employee benefits and training  stock based compensation  and commission expense and ii a decrease of  in the use of outside sales contractors 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately y  in non employee commissions primarily related to retailer marketing allowances and z an increase of approximately  in public relations  advertising  marketing and tradeshow expense  travel and related expenditures 
general and administrative expense fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent general and administrative percent of total revenue the company s general and administrative expense was  or of total revenue  and  or of total revenue for the years ended june  and  respectively  a decrease 
this  decrease when comparing expenditures for the year ended june  with the same period ended june  is principally due to i the settlement of a lawsuit and related legal fees in the prior year through the combination of cash and equity and ii a decrease of approximately  in travel and related expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by w a  increase in bad debt expense  x a  increase in in salary  employee benefits  payroll taxes  bonuses  and compensation related expenditures such as stock based compensation expense for certain employees and board members that are based on multi year vesting schedules y an  increase in investor relations  shareholder cost  and other professional fees  and z a  increase in facility expenses 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent depreciation and amortization percent of total revenue the company s depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the year ended june  and  respectively  an increase of 
this increase of  for the year ended june  when compared to the year ended june  is due to an increase in depreciation related to new capital hardware investments and an increase in amortization of capitalized software costs related to a project capitalized in fiscal year other income and expense fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent other gains interest income expense total other income expense net other income expense was net other income of  when compared with net other expense of  for the year ended june  and june   respectively 
this  change is principally due to a  decrease in interest expense resulting from the retirement of certain notes payable in july and january and a gain on extinguishment of current liabilities of preferred dividends fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent preferred dividends percent of total revenue dividends declared on preferred stock was  for the year ended june  when compared with  accrued in the same period in the  increase in accrued dividends is principally the result of dividends accrued on the additional series a preferred paid in kind in lieu of cash dividends 
this increase has been partially offset by the conversion of shares of series a preferred to common stock 
holders of series a preferred are entitled to a annual dividend dividend rate payable quarterly in either cash or additional series a preferred at the option of the company with fractional shares paid in cash 
holders of series b preferred are entitled to a annual dividend payable quarterly in cash 
the dividend rate with respect the series a preferred increases to per annum in the event the average closing price of the company s common stock during the last thirty trading days of any calendar quarter is less than per share a dividend adjustment 
a holder of series a preferred has notified the company that a dividend adjustment is required as a result of the average closing price of the company s common stock for the thirty day period ended march  management disagrees with the method of calculation used by the holder and believes that the company s calculation determining that a dividend adjustment is not required is reasonable  and that an ultimate determination that an alternative method should be employed is doubtful 
the pro forma effect of a dividend adjustment is shown in the table below fiscal year ended june  variance as reported pro forma dollars percent dividends on series a preferred net loss applicable to common shareholders basic and diluted loss per share 
table of contents financial position  liquidity and capital resources we believe our existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth and expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  in a timely fashion or at all 
fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cash and cash equivalents we have historically funded our operations with cash from operations  equity financings and debt borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents was  and  at june   and june   respectively 
this  decrease from june  to june  was principally due to cash used in financing activities of  and cash used in investing activities of  these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of  net cash flows from operating activities fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cash flows provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is summarized as follows net loss income noncash expense and income  net net changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash expense decreased by  in compared to noncash expense decreased as a result of a  increase in bad debt expense  an  increase in depreciation and amortization and a  increase in stock compensation from to these noncash expense increases were offset by the issuance of  in company common stock in a prior year litigation settlement and other gains of  the net changes in operating assets and liabilities used  less cash in compared to net cash flows from investing activities fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cash flows used in provided by investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of  for the year ended june  this  decrease in cash used in investing activities in when compared to the same period in was the result of a  capitalization of software development costs in the prior year and a  decrease in purchases of property and equipment

these uses of cash were partially offset by increases in cash provided by the exercise of options and warrants of  
table of contents working capital and management s plan at june   the company had negative working capital of  when compared with negative working capital of  at june  this  increase in working capital is principally a result of an increase in deferred revenue fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent current assets current assets at june  totaled  a decrease of  when compared to  at june  this decrease in current assets is due primarily to decreases in i cash and cash equivalents and ii prepaid expense and other current assets 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in receivables

the  comparative decrease in current liabilities is principally due to the retirement of certain notes payable and a decrease in accounts payable 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
while no assurances can be given  management currently intends to continue to reduce its indebtedness in subsequent periods utilizing existing cash resources and projected cash flow from operations 
in addition  management may also refinance or restructure certain of the company s indebtedness to extend the maturities of such indebtedness to address its short and long term working capital requirements 
management believes that these initiatives will enable us to address our debt service requirements during the next twelve months  as well as fund our currently anticipated operations and capital spending requirements 
the financial statements do not reflect any adjustments should cash flow from operations be insufficient to meet our spending and debt service requirements  and we are otherwise unable to refinance or restructure our indebtedness

in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit s indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the asset s carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit s indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than the asset s carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our business is currently conducted principally in the united states 
as a result  our financial results are not affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets 
we do not engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates  although if the geographical scope of our business broadens  we may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to interest rate changes related to borrowing has been limited by the use of fixed rate borrowings on the majority of our outstanding debt  and we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate 
at june   the debt portfolio was composed of approximately variable rate debt and fixed rate debt 
the table that follows presents fair values of principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio as of june cash and cash equivalents aggregate fair value weighted average interest rate cash and cash equivalents nm the table that follows presents the principal amounts of our variable and fixed rate debt
