item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition  operating results  earnings or stock price  in various ways 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products  reduced profitability or deterioration in the quality of our working capital 
domestic and international economic  political and social conditions are uncertain due to a variety of factors  including global  regional and national economic downturns and financial stability  the availability and cost of credit  volatility in stock and credit markets  energy costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the risk of global conflict  the risk of terrorism  political turmoil  or war in a given country or region  and natural disasters and public health issues 
our business depends on our customers demand for our products and services  the general economic health of current and prospective customers  and their desire or ability to make investments in technology 
a deterioration of global  regional or local political  economic or social conditions could affect potential customers in ways that reduce demand for our products and disrupt our manufacturing and sales plans and efforts 
these global  regional or local conditions may also cause governments to change their spending priorities  which may delay  reduce or eliminate funding for our products and services 
acts of terrorism  wars  natural disasters  public health issues and increased energy costs could disrupt commerce in ways that could impair our supply chain and our ability to get products to our customers and increase our manufacturing and delivery costs 
changes or increased volatility of our foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political  economic or social conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flows  revenue and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our international sales are quoted  billed and collected in the customer s local currency in emea and in us dollars elsewhere 
our product costs are largely denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our product margins are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the cost of goods and services that we purchase and personnel that we employ outside of the united states 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate changes by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
our currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
additionally  adverse movements in currency exchange rates could result in increases in our cost of goods sold or reduction in growth in international orders  materially impacting our cash flows and earnings 

table of contents growth of and changes in our revenues and profits depend on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
fluctuations in our sales mix could have an adverse impact on or increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and profits 
sales of our products to large enterprises tend to have lower prices and gross margins than sales to smaller firms 
in addition  our gross margins vary depending on the product or service and the geographic region in which sales are made  and costs may fluctuate based on the distribution of our sales between various jurisdictions 
growth in our revenues  gross margins and earnings therefore depends on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
our introduction of lower priced products may also affect our ability to sell high end products  even if those products have advanced features 
in addition  our distributors  dealers and resellers can have a significant impact on the mix of our products and services 
if we are unable to execute a sales strategy that results in a favorable sales mix  our revenues  gross margins and earnings could be adversely affected 
further  changes in the mix of our sales from quarter to quarter or year to year may make our revenues  gross margins and earnings more volatile and difficult to predict 
we have entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement that includes covenants  financial tests and ratios  which  if not met  may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we maintain a senior secured credit facility that contains certain customary covenants to the bank providing the credit facility  including financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests 
the credit facility is secured by pledges of equity in and assets of certain of our domestic subsidiaries  which have also guaranteed our payment obligations under the credit facility 
we must take into account the requirements of these covenants in the conduct of our business 
depending on the circumstances under which we could fail to satisfy one or more of these covenants  we may need to make choices that limit some of our business or financing activities in order to comply with them 
these choices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we were not in compliance with certain of our debt covenants effective as of december    but the bank agreed to amend the credit facility agreement to bring us back into compliance 
however  if we fail to comply with the requirements of the credit facility in the future  we would be in default  and we may not be able to obtain the necessary amendments or waivers of an event of default 
in that event  the bank could declare all amounts outstanding  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the bank could also move to enforce its rights under its security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries 
if at that time we were not able to repay any amounts borrowed under the credit facility or to borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make the repayment  or if alternative financing is not available on favorable terms  our business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to improve our business processes and systems and transform our supply chain or if those efforts have unintended results 
in order to increase sales and profits  including those of acquired businesses  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in ways that are cost effective and efficient from an operational and a tax perspective 
to achieve our objectives  we are continuing to streamline our sales systems  supply chain and business processes and to implement a new global enterprise resource planning erp system 
we have also established an international headquarters in singapore 
these restructurings are large  complex undertakings and may result in unanticipated costs  liabilities and operational disruptions  or tax or other financial consequences 
they might not proceed as planned  could result in unintended consequences or might not accomplish the intended goals  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our sales  profits  results of operations and earnings 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
competition for skilled employees is high in our industry and the countries in which we operate  and we must remain competitive in terms of compensation and other employee benefits to retain key employees 
in connection with businesses that we acquire  we may need to rely on these management and employees to continue to operate those businesses and to help us deepen our penetration of the market for their products and services 
in addition  to pursue new products  services or strategic initiatives  we may need to attract individuals with particular knowledge  skills or qualifications 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining skilled managers and employees  we may be unable to maintain and expand our business 

table of contents some of our competitors are substantially larger and more profitable than we are  which may give them a competitive advantage 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
both historically and as a result of recent consolidation in the aidc industry  we have certain competitors that are larger and potentially stronger than we are  and consequently we expect that competition may continue to intensify 
some of our competitors have  and new competitors may have  substantially more capital  revenue  profit or other and financial resources than we have 
among other things  these advantages may allow them to invest more in r d  sales and marketing  and customer support  achieve greater economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution  weather market downturns longer or adapt more quickly to emerging technology developments  market trends or price declines  or precipitate market changes by introducing new or complementary technologies  reducing prices or otherwise changing their market offerings 
such competition may require us to reduce our prices  thereby lowering our margins  or to increase our costs  and this could materially and adversely affect our earnings 
there is no assurance that our strategies to counteract our competitors advantages will succeed  and if they do not  our business or financial results could suffer as a result 
the aidc industry  including the voice technology segment  is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success depends upon the frequent enhancement of existing products and timely introduction of new products that meet our customers needs 
customer requirements for aidc products evolve and technological changes in our industry occur regularly 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products 
enhancing existing products and developing new products is complex and uncertain 
it often requires significant investments in r d 
we may not have adequate capital or resources to invest in r d to keep pace with technological changes in our industry 
even if we make adequate investments in r d  they may not result in products that are attractive or acceptable to our customers 
new technologies  such as vocollect s voice technology  may also not achieve widespread acceptance or may be preempted by competing technologies 
furthermore  we may not be able to launch new or improved products before our competition launches comparable products 
any of these factors could cause our business or financial results to suffer 
introduction of new products could render our existing products obsolete  which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results 
introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors could render certain of our products obsolete 
this could reduce sales volumes  or result in substantial excess or obsolete inventories  or both 
if that were to occur  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory at a substantial discount which may also be below the cost of making or acquiring that inventory and cause us to write off the difference 
if we are unable to anticipate the obsolescence of our products or to mitigate the risk of product obsolescence  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
our reliance on third party distributors could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in addition to offering our products and services to certain customers and resellers directly  we rely to a significant and increasing degree on our channel partners to sell our products and services to end users 
in and  one distributor  scansource  inc  accounted for more than of our sales of intermec branded products 
it or other distributors may account for a substantial portion of our sales of our products or services in the future 
changes in markets  customers or products  or negative developments in general economic and financial conditions and the availability of credit  may adversely affect the ability of such distributors of our products and services to bring them to market at the right time and in the right locations 
in addition  our competitors strategic relationships with  or acquisitions of  these distributors could disrupt our relationships with them 
any such disruption could impair or delay sales of our products and services to end users and increase our costs of distribution  which could adversely affect business and financial results 
use of third party contract manufacturers  suppliers and service providers could adversely affect our product quality  delivery schedules or customer satisfaction  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in relying on third party contractors to assemble most of our intermec branded products  we do not have direct physical control over the manufacturing process and operations 
third party suppliers also provide the components that our contract manufacturers and vocollect use in the 
table of contents final assembly of our products 
some of these components may be available only from a single source 
we also outsource a number of services to third party service providers  including certain design services  transportation and logistics  management of spare parts  and warranty service 
accordingly  our products and services could be adversely affected by  among other things  inadequate quality control of these third party suppliers and service providers  or by their inability to design products  parts and components to our specifications  to ship product  to manage our product inventory  to meet delivery deadlines or to otherwise satisfy our customers needs 
failure of these third party suppliers and service providers in any of these respects could negatively affect our customer relationships  our sales and our earnings 
failures on the part of our third party designers could impair our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new products 
the disruption of our supply chain could cause us to incur greater expense to purchase parts or products in short supply  to purchase quantities of these items in excess of our estimated near term requirements  or to take other steps to ensure the availability of necessary quantities that could increase our costs 
if vocollect s manufacturing process or facility is disrupted  sales of vocollect s products could be disrupted  and we could incur unforeseen costs or loss of revenues 
final assembly of vocollect s products is performed at a single location in the us if the operations of that facility are disrupted  we would be unable to fulfill customer orders for the period of the disruption 
we would not be able to recognize revenue on orders that we could not ship  and we might need to modify our standard sales terms to secure the commitment of new customers during the period of the disruption and perhaps longer 
depending on the cause of the disruption  we could incur significant costs to remedy the disruption and resume product shipments 
such a disruption could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations and earnings 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses  patents  technologies  products or services  and our failure to do so successfully may not generate the intended benefits  adversely affecting our competitive position or financial results 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or investments to expand our suite of products and services 
our growth could be hampered if we were unable to identify suitable acquisitions and investments or agree on the terms of any such acquisition or investment 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction if we lack sufficient resources to finance the transaction on our own and cannot obtain financing at a reasonable cost 
furthermore  integration of new businesses or technologies into our business may have any of the following adverse effects we may have difficulty transitioning customers and other business relationships to intermec 
we may lose some customer or vendor relationships due to our acquisition of competitors of those customers or vendors 
we may have problems unifying management following a transaction 
we may lose key employees from our existing or acquired businesses 
we may experience intensified competition from other companies seeking to expand sales and market share during the integration period 
our management s attention may be diverted to the assimilation of the technology and personnel of acquired businesses or new product or service lines 
we may experience difficulties in coordinating geographically disparate organizations and corporate cultures and integrating management personnel with different business backgrounds 
if we are not able to complete such acquisitions and successfully integrate them  or to complete investments and successfully realize their intended benefits  our competitive position may suffer  which could adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and earnings 
business combinations and other acquisition transactions may have a direct adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  or on our stock price 
in order to complete acquisitions or investments  we may have to use cash  issue new equity securities with dilutive effects on existing 
table of contents stockholders  take on new debt  assume contingent liabilities or amortize assets or expenses in a manner that might have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet  results of operations or liquidity 
we are required to record certain acquisition related costs and other items as current period expenses  which would have the effect of reducing our reported earnings in the period in which an acquisition is consummated 
we are also required to record post closing goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges in the period in which they occur  which could result in a significant charge to our earnings in that period 
these and other potential negative effects of an acquisition could prevent us from realizing the benefits of such transactions and have a material adverse impact on our stock price  revenues  revenue growth  balance sheet  results of operations and liquidity 
our inability to successfully protect  defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
to protect our ip portfolio  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
ip infringement lawsuits are complex proceedings  and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in any or all of these cases or that we will achieve the desired outcome in terms of injunctive relief or damages or that the other parties will be able to pay the damages awarded 
adverse results in such lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and with our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
adverse outcomes in ip lawsuits could also reduce our royalty revenues 
in some periods  ip litigation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations of revenue or expenses from prior periods  increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse impact on our operating profits  results of operations or net earnings 
since our business strategy includes global expansion  we are operating in developing countries where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing ip rights are very new or non existent and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with ip rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries  because we may not be able to enforce ip rights in those jurisdictions and alternative methods of protecting our ip rights may not be effective 
our inability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations 
our inability to successfully defend ourselves from the intellectual property infringement claims of others could have an adverse effect on the growth of our business and results of operations 
our competitors  our potential competitors and other companies may have ip rights covering products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their ip rights to prevent us from selling some of our products  to collect royalties from us  or to deter us from enforcing our ip rights against them 
those efforts may include infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
these lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any ip lawsuits brought against us 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our customers  we could be enjoined from selling and our customers could be enjoined from using our products or services and ordered to pay for past damages 
we might also be required to pay future royalties or be forced to incur the cost of designing around a third party s ip 
in some periods  ip litigation expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods 
any of these events could increase the volatility of our financial results or have a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues  operating profits  results of operations or earnings per share 
our failure to expand our ip portfolio could adversely affect the growth of our business and results of operations 
expansion of our ip portfolio is one of the available methods of developing new or improved products to grow our revenues and our profits 
this involves a complex and costly set of activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patents and other ip can be adversely affected by insufficient inventiveness of our employees  by changes in ip laws  treaties  and regulations  and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws  treaties and regulations 
our ability to expand our ip portfolio could also be adversely affected by the lack of valuable ip for sale or license at affordable prices 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable ip in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate or that we will be able to use or license that ip or that we will be able to generate meaningful royalty revenue or profits from our ip 

table of contents estimating our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
the computation of income taxes is complex  because it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the income tax expense or benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our global tax rate for the year  which includes forward looking financial projections 
such financial projections are based on numerous assumptions  including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction 
it is difficult to accurately forecast various items that make up the projections 
examples of items that could cause variability in our income tax rate include our mix of income by jurisdiction  tax deductions for stock option expense  application of transfer pricing rules  tax audits  and changes to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
future events  such as changes in our business and the tax law in the jurisdictions where we do business  could also affect our rate 
for these reasons  our global tax rate for the year may be materially different than our estimates for interim periods 
such differences may result in material differences between our actual reported net earnings and earnings per share  and our or analysts estimates 
if we do not generate sufficient future taxable income  we may be required to recognize additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the value of our deferred tax assets depends  in part  on our ability to use them to offset taxable income in future years 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain other jurisdictions  or if there are significant changes in tax laws or the tax rates or the period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
such an increase would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and have a negative impact on our operating results 
if our future taxable income is increased  the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets may be reduced 
these changes may also contribute to the volatility of our financial results 
our ability to use tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future income tax liability could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change within the meaning of internal revenue code section in that event  we may be required to recognize a noncash charge to our earnings  which could be material 
we have substantial tax credit and net operating loss nol carryforwards collectively  tax attributes for united states federal income tax purposes that are available to reduce our future income tax liability 
under sections and of the internal revenue code  following an ownership change  certain limitations apply to the use by a loss corporation of its tax attributes arising before the ownership change 
in general  an ownership change would occur if there is a cumulative change in the ownership of our common stock of more than by one or more shareholders during a three year period 
in the event of an ownership change  the tax attributes that may be used to offset our future taxable income in each year after the ownership change will be subject to an annual limitation 
in general  the annual limitation is equal to the product of the fair market value of our stock on the date of the ownership change and the long term tax exempt rate which is published monthly by the irs  subject to specified adjustments the section limitation 
the computation of percentage increases in ownership by shareholders is subject to numerous factual and legal uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will agree with our calculation 
in general  we have no control over the fact or timing of acquisitions or transfers of our common stock 
furthermore  in the event an ownership change occurs at a time when our stock price has declined  a lower section limitation would result  which could result in a significant portion of our tax attributes expiring before we could fully use them 
we cannot predict whether there will be changes in the ownership of our common stock that would result in the imposition of a section limitation 
however  if such an ownership change were to occur  our ability to use our tax attributes could be substantially limited 
in such a case we could be required to record a valuation allowance and take a noncash charge against our earnings to reduce our net deferred tax assets in the quarter in which the ownership change occurs  which could adversely affect our financial results for that quarter and for the year in question 
furthermore  our inability to fully use our tax attributes could result in higher tax payments  thereby reducing our cash flow 
if we do not comply with agreements that we have made in certain jurisdictions  we may lose favorable tax treatment that results from those agreements 
in some jurisdictions in which we operate  favorable tax rates 
table of contents and other tax benefits are subject to our compliance with agreements that we have with relevant governmental agencies 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of those agreements  our tax rate in those jurisdictions might increase or we might lose certain tax benefits  which could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate or our financial results 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from irs and other tax authorities examinations 
the irs and tax authorities in countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
for example  our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we face risks as a global company that could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we face risks that companies operating in a single country or region do not have 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries 
our sales could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  security requirements  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in a particular country or region could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our assets at risk 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand sales of our products in any market  and disruptions of our sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 
in addition  aspects of our business are subject to a variety of us and international laws regarding data privacy 
the european union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various jurisdictions 
the evolving regulatory environment in which we operate could adversely impact aspects of our business or the businesses of third parties on whom we depend 
compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue or profits 
noncompliance could result in disruptions to our business or operations  proceedings against the company by government entities  customers or others  require changes to our business practices and lead to legal liability 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to sell or deliver products  maintain our work force in affected areas  or to continue or expand our operations in particular markets  which could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operation 
a significant percentage of our products and their components are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us from time to time  we contract with companies outside of the us to perform one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of domestic and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability and potentially weaker foreign ip protections may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex and can be expensive 
there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks in an efficient or cost effective manner  if at all 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act could subject us to civil or criminal liability 
as a global company  we are also subject to risks that our employees  contractors  representatives or agents could conduct our operations outside the us in ways that violate the us foreign corrupt practices act or other similar anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures to comply with those laws  our 
table of contents employees  contractors  representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies 
moreover  third party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services may violate our anti bribery policies and procedures  because it may be more difficult for us to oversee their conduct 
any such violations could result in fines and other penalties and could otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
global regulation and regulatory compliance  including environmental  technological and standards setting regulations  may limit our sales or increase our costs  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to domestic and international technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products 
such standards and regulations may also require us to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
we are also subject to self imposed standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epc global that provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly use our products with products from other aidc vendors  which our customers demand 
changes in standards and regulations may be introduced at any time and with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country or region  increase our cost of supplying our products by requiring us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations  or require us to license our patents on a royalty free basis and prevent us from seeking damages and injunctive relief for patent infringements 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
due to these uncertainties and compliance burdens  our customers may postpone or cancel purchases of our products 
as a result  global regulation and compliance could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
we could be negatively affected by information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
we face the risk of a security breach  whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the internet  malware  computer viruses  or other significant disruption of our information technology it networks and related systems 
we face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of the it networks  products and related systems that we develop  install  operate and maintain for certain of our customers  which may involve managing and protecting information relating to our customers data or our data 
it system failures could also result in the unintentional disclosure of intermec s confidential information or that of our customers and employees 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  or to sabotage systems  change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services  damage our reputation  disrupt our business  lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales

we are reporting vocollect products and services as a reportable segment  voice solutions 
additional information about the following business highlights may be found in this management s discussion and analysis 
total revenues were million  including our acquired businesses 
our revenues outside of north america improved considerably as compared with this was primarily due to the positive effect of revenues from the vocollect business  organic growth and the favorable impact of foreign currency conversion rates 
north america revenues increased in  over  primarily due to the positive effect of revenues from the vocollect business 
we anticipate continued growth in in international revenue and in north america revenue 
however  volatility in global economic conditions could negatively affect our ability to grow revenues as we intend 
in  revenue in our intermec branded product segment  including systems and solutions and printer and media  grew as compared with  primarily due to increased systems and solutions sales across all regions 
service sales increased in  over  primarily due to revenues from enterprise mobile acquired in march we anticipate continued growth in each of our segments in gross margins improved in as compared with due to the addition of the voice solutions segment as well as an overall favorable product mix 
we intend to improve gross margins again in through a combination of favorable sales mix and higher product volumes which we believe can more than offset competitive pricing pressure and unfavorable currency translation adjustments 
in  our research and development r d expense net of r d tax credits was of gross revenue as compared with of gross revenue in this reflects the continued importance of new releases in our major product lines as well as an increase in the pace of innovation required in the mobile computing part of our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  we invested in sales and marketing initiatives  with the result that our selling  general and administrative sg a expense was of gross revenue as compared with of gross revenue in we expect a modest increase in the sales and marketing portion of sg a expense again in to expand our sales capacity and productivity 
we experienced certain significant non cash charges in the fourth quarter of  which are discussed more fully below 
the largest among these included an increase in a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  the expense of previously capitalized legal fees in patent litigation  and impairment of the value of undeveloped real estate held for sale 
these non cash charges had the effect of reducing our earnings for the quarter and for the full year 
we plan to remain focused on the execution of our strategy providing leading mobile aidc solutions for fast moving businesses in many industries worldwide 
this will primarily involve organic activities such as increased marketing and sales efforts  channel partner expansion and the introduction of new and innovative hardware  software and services 
as we have in the past  we also intend to pursue mergers  acquisitions or joint ventures when we believe they are appropriate methods of executing our strategy 
during the past three year period  we have invested in programs that would benefit future periods  such as streamlining our product manufacturing and supply chain operations  expanding and refining our sales channel  implementing a new global enterprise resource planning erp system and developing products and services that will effectively support our strategy 
we have also reduced our operating cost structure over the past three years  and we expect to rigorously pursue continuing improvements in operational efficiency and cost reduction going forward 
in  we took advantage of our strong financial position to acquire exciting businesses that expand our solutions vision and enhance our total offerings 
we believe these initiatives have positioned us to take advantage of regions and markets with improving economic conditions and other opportunities

the increase in product gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to an increased volume of product sales including acquisitions and favorable product mix 
the decrease in intermec branded service gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december   was mainly attributable to lower services sales to our north america customers  lower initial margins from our acquired managed services focused businesses and one time costs associated with our transition to an outsourcing supplier in emea  which are not included in restructuring costs

gain on intellectual property sales in  we recorded million of gains on intellectual property sales  net of commissions  as a result of sales of certain patents to unrelated parties for the year ended december  there were no similar gains reported in or from time to time we may seek to monetize patents or other intellectual property when doing so is not inconsistent with our business strategies 
the timing and amount of proceeds we may realize from these efforts is not readily foreseeable 
restructuring charges in may  we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce our operating cost structure 
under this business restructuring plan we reduced our non us headcount in our service depot and support operations 
the total pre tax restructuring costs for this plan were million  including employee termination costs of million  and other transitional costs of million 
we recorded all of these charges in in january and april  we committed to business restructuring plans intended to reorganize our sales function and reduce our work force 
the total pre tax restructuring costs for these plans were million  including employee termination costs of million  and other transitional costs of million 
we recorded 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and million of the restructuring charges in and  respectively 
as of december   all restructuring related charges had been recorded  and substantially all of the severance related and periodic transitional costs were cash expenditures 
impairment of property  plant and equipment we recorded a million impairment charge for the year ended december   as a result of a write down in the value of vacant land held for sale

net interest expense of million for the year ended december   unfavorably impacted pre tax earnings by million compared to net interest income of million in while we had no external debt we incurred interest expense on cash advances against the value of certain corporate owned life insurance policies 
in this interest expense was slightly greater than interest income earned on cash and investments due to lower average interest rates 
income tax expense benefit in millions year ended december  amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount income tax expense benefit we are required to assess quarterly  the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not basis 
management considers all evidence available for the recovery of the assets  which includes the following in the order of their persuasiveness i future taxable temporary differences  ii loss carry back availability  iii tax planning strategies  and iv expected future operating income 
consistent with the guidance under asc  when a company has incurred cumulative pretax losses for a three year period  it is more difficult to rely upon expected future operating income as sufficient evidence for recovery of its deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  in the us  we moved from a cumulative profit position to a cumulative loss position for the most recent three year period ended december  accordingly  we used the average adjusted us profitability over the previous three years to conclude that a valuation allowance was required against a portion of our us deferred tax assets and we recorded an increase of million in our valuation allowance during the year ended december  that was reflected as an expense in the fourth quarter of in addition we had net operating losses in certain foreign operations against which we recorded valuation reserves totaling million until a stronger history of profits in those jurisdictions is realized 
this increase was reflected as an expense in the year ended december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our effective tax rate from continuing operations for is higher than the us statutory rate of due primarily to the valuation allowances reserves discussed above and our mix and levels of taxable income between jurisdictions 
in  our foreign earnings in singapore were relatively higher than and subject to tax at a tax rate  which had a beneficial impact to our tax rate 
as part of our supply chain restructuring in  we licensed non us intellectual property exploitation rights from our domestic corporations to a wholly owned non us subsidiary in singapore 
in and we recorded a non cash tax expense of approximately million each year to establish a singapore headquarters for our supply chain operations and foreign sales activities 
this is a recurring item regardless of the amount of income from operations  and will be a tax expense of approximately million tax expense annually through we expect to license non us intellectual property and exploitation rights from our recently acquired businesses to our singapore subsidiary 
in the normal course of our business  we seek lawful  tax efficient means of managing our income tax expense 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
foreign currency transactions and effect of foreign exchange rates we are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program  which is designed to minimize short term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
movements in foreign exchange rates  net of hedging activities  resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for fiscal year  our operations derived approximately of revenues from non us customers 
at december   long lived assets attributable to countries outside of the us comprised of total long lived assets 
the largest components of these assets are attributable to singapore 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   million of our cash is designated as offshore working capital not available for us operations 
although our remaining cash is available for us operations  a portion is permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
we do not intend to repatriate the permanently reinvested portion of our cash 
however  if we were to do so  under currently applicable tax laws we would incur tax of approximately million 
cash flow summary the following discussion reflects the effects of the immaterial restatement presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our cash flows are summarized in the following table in millions year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities in continuing operations net cash provided by used in investing activities in continuing operations net cash provided by used in financing activities in continuing operations 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  a decrease of million compared to the december  balance of million 
the decrease in cash is primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of vocollect and an increase in inventory  accounts receivable and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the borrowing of debt 
the increase in inventory reflects additional units being shipped via ocean freight to reduce freight costs and a ramp up of new products 
cash provided by operating activities consisted of net losses adjusted for non cash items and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the year ended december    was million and consisted of a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of million and cash used in working capital and other activities of million 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the year ended december    was million and consisted of a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of million 
operating activities in provided lower cash flows compared to  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue 
in  the million of cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to cash provided by working capital and other activities of million mainly due to volume driven decreases in accounts receivable and our efforts in inventory reduction  partially offset by cash payments for restructuring activities 
investing activities for the year ended december   used cash of million primarily due to the acquisitions of vocollect and enterprise mobile and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by the conversion of short term investments to cash 
in  investing activities provided million of cash primarily due to sales of investments of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
in  investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash primarily due to our purchase of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
financing activities for the year ended december   provided cash of million primarily related to incurring debt of million  offset by a million repayment of debt and a repurchase of our common stock of million 
financing activities for the year ended december   used cash of million primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock of million  partially offset by the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and exercised stock options 
financing activities in provided cash of million  related primarily to the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercised stock options 
capital resources our principal capital resources include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  we have a secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility with a maximum amount available of million at december  refer to note  revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of the revolving facility 
as discussed in note  acquisitions and goodwill  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with vocollect the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of vocollect 
in connection with entering into the merger agreement we converted the revolving facility into a million  three year  secured revolving credit facility  upon closing the merger on march  on december   we further amended the revolving facility to expand our borrowing capacity to million and extend the term of the arrangement to december  in connection with completion of its procedures for closing its financial records for the quarter and year ended december   we determined that  effective on that date  we were not in compliance with certain of our covenants under the revolving facility  due in part to the tax valuation allowance and write off of patent defense costs that were recorded as charges to the fourth quarter 
accordingly  on february   we amended our revolving facility to modify the net income covenant to allow for these 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued noncash charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the revolving facility was used to finance a portion of the merger  to finance our working capital requirements  for letters of credit  and for general corporate purposes 
during  our average borrowings outstanding subsequent to the vocollect acquisition were million 
at december   we had borrowing capacity of million  borrowings of million and million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility 
after considering the february  amendment  we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the revolving facility at december  the key terms of the facility are set forth in note  revolving credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
they include financial covenants related to our tangible net worth  annual net income after taxes  quarterly adjusted net income before taxes  a maximum debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the revolving facility and asset coverage ratio 
for and  the net income covenant required million of net income annually 
the quarterly adjusted net income before tax covenant also requires million of pretax income for four quarters  however  adjustments are allowed for certain noncash charges and acquisition related integration costs 
we expect to remain in compliance with these and other covenants for the next twelve months 
however  as illustrated by the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  unanticipated accounting charges and expenses can adversely affect our compliance with these covenants 
if an event of default occurs  the bank may accelerate payment amounts due under the facility at its option  the bank s obligation to extend further credit will cease and the bank may exercise its rights with respect to i assets of certain domestic subsidiaries  ii the pledges of equity in certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries  and iii the guaranties of payment obligations from certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
we believe the company will be in compliance with the financial covenants for the next twelve months 
refer to risk factors for further discussion of the risks of noncompliance with the requirements of the credit facility 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments combined with projected cash flows from operations and funds available from the revolving facility noted above will provide adequate funding to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure  and pension contribution requirements for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may look for potential acquisition targets for growth opportunities within our market  or to expand into new markets  which we believe can be funded with a combination of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and additional financing 
the business restructuring plan that we committed to in april reduced our workforce and resulted in the curtailment of pension benefits to the terminated employees who were participants in our us pension plans 
additionally  on december   we announced the decision to amend our pension plans and freeze the remainder of our us pension plans effective february  these actions are expected to reduce our future pension benefits cost 
we are required to make minimum funding for these plans under the employee retirement income security act of erisa or other rules governing funding of pension plans 
we may also make discretionary contributions to fund these plans in future years 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plans in during the year ended december   we entered into share repurchase agreements with a broker under rule b and rule b of the securities exchange act of  to facilitate the repurchase of up to an aggregate total of million of our outstanding common stock  pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization by our board of directors 
we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of per share under these share repurchase agreements 
we may continue to engage in future share repurchases up to our remaining board authorization of million 
the number of shares and the timing of any share repurchases will depend on factors such as the stock price  economic and market conditions  regulatory restrictions  and the attractiveness of other capital deployment opportunities 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depending on our assessment of the economic environment from time to time  we may decide to hold more cash than may be required to fund our future investment in working capital  capital expenditures and research and development and to implement changes in our cost structure 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on our revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flows from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  in millions 
the table does not include amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments pension and other postretirement cash funding requirements total contractual obligations operating leases are discussed in note  litigation  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement plans are discussed in note  pension and other postretirement benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of finished goods or raw materials or other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as certain purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing or service contract needs and are typically fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons  but may represent an estimated annual spend or authorization with actual orders placed as spending is required 
we have requirements to provide minimum funding for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans under erisa regulations  which are reflected in the table above 
we may make future discretionary contributions to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
we expect to contribute approximately and million to our us and us pension plans  respectively  in see note  pension and other postretirement benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december   has been omitted from the table above  because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in january  we entered into a new long term lease for real estate to support ongoing operations that would have increased the commitments in the above contractual obligations table had it been signed at december  by the following amounts in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain indemnification and reimbursement agreements 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note  litigation  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue  net of excise and sales taxes  when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
we consider these criteria met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when earned  the amount due is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is recognized when the customer has assumed risk of loss of the goods sold and all performance obligations are complete 
these sales may contain discounts  price exception  return provision or other customer incentives 
we reduce revenue by providing allowances for estimated customer returns  price exception and other incentives that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
the sales allowances are based on management s best estimate of the amount of allowances that the customer will ultimately receive and on our historical experience taking into account the type of products sold and type of customers involved 
we accrue the estimated cost of basic product warranties at the time we recognize revenue based on historical experience 
in addition to basic product warranties  we frequently offer extended warranties  including renewal  to our customers in the form of product maintenance services 
our product and maintenance services are typically separately priced 
we defer the stated amount of the separately priced product maintenance services contracts and recognize the deferred revenue as services are rendered  generally straight line over the contract term 
for intermec branded products we infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements with our customers  and these sales may include deliverables such as hardware  software  professional consulting services and maintenance support services 
for arrangements involving multiple deliverables  where deliverables include software and non software products and services  we apply the provisions of multiple elements accounting to separate the deliverables and allocate the total arrangement consideration 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
in september  the fasb amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements new accounting principles 
the new accounting principles permit prospective or retrospective adoption  and we elected prospective adoption at the beginning of the first quarter of these new accounting principles do not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
we sell products with embedded software to our customers 
the embedded software is not sold separately  it is not a significant focus of the marketing effort and we do not provide post contract customer 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued support specific to the software or incur significant costs related to creating software products 
additionally  the functionality that the software provides is marketed as part of the overall product 
the software embedded in the product is incidental to the equipment as a whole such that software revenue recognition is not generally applicable 
in certain situations where our solutions contain software that is more than incidental to the hardware and services  revenue related to the software and software related elements is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition accounting 
our customers infrequently request that delivery and passage of title and risk of loss occur on a bill and hold basis 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue in accordance with guidance specific to bill and hold transactions  which are deferred until delivery occurs 
revenue recognition voice solutions 
for voice solutions  a substantial portion of the revenues are derived from arrangements that contain multiple deliverables that may include terminals and software  accessories  hardware and support and consulting services 
the majority of these products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality 
as a result  we separate and assign a value to each element in our multiple element arrangements 
for those deliverables that qualify as separate units of accounting  we must assign a value based on each deliverable s vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of value  if available  or third party evidence tpe of its value if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
arrangement consideration is then allocated to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
revenue is recognized when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
we consider these criteria met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
management performs an analysis to determine the relative selling price of each unit of accounting 
we have established vsoe for certain hardware and software support  based on standalone renewal transactions  and for professional services  based on standalone consulting services 
we have been unable to establish comparable tpe for our deliverables 
our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor product selling prices are on a standalone basis 
management s esp is used for terminals and related software and accessories 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors  including  but not limited to  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  and pricing practices 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
voice solutions units of accounting are terminals and related software  headsets and accessories  hardware support  software support and professional services 
products are typically considered delivered upon shipment 
support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed  which is typically one to three years 
consulting services  which are typically short term in nature  are recognized upon completion 
our arrangements generally do not provide any provisions for cancellation  termination  or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 
inventory obsolescence 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that are not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  or there are technology or design changes  additional inventory reserves or write downs could be required  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions  and or technology or design changes  could positively impact future operating results if previously reserved or written down inventory is sold 
management regularly evaluates market and technology conditions and design changes to ensure that our reserves are adequate 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million  which include million of general business credit carry forwards and million of foreign tax credit carry forwards with expiration dates ranging from through the remainder of our deferred tax assets consist of tax timing items including postretirement obligations  deferred revenue and capitalized r d expenses 
our valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets is million 
in analyzing utilization of our deferred tax assets  we consider in the following in the order of their persuasiveness future taxable temporary differences  ii loss carry back availability  iii prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and iv expected future operating income and the mix of these earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
when a company has incurred cumulative pretax losses for a three year period  it is more difficult to rely upon expected future operating income as sufficient evidence for recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the us jurisdiction moved to a cumulative loss for the most recent three year period ended december  in assessing the most objective and verifiable evidence  we used the average adjusted profitability over the previous three years to conclude that an incremental million valuation allowance was required against a portion of our us deferred tax assets 
this was after considering all evidence available including future taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
to the extent the us business were to generate less profitability than the average historical adjusted profitability in that jurisdiction  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance and record additional tax expense would be required in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we also recognize the largest amount of benefits from uncertain tax positions that are greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
such amounts are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have qualified and nonqualified pension plans that cover some of our employees 
our us qualified pension plan and us nonqualified plans were fully frozen effective february  and december   respectively 
annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to be required in order to adequately fund the plans 
we expect to contribute approximately and million to our us and us pension plans  respectively  in we perform an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets or when major events occur requiring remeasurement 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most important of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and health care cost projections 
these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively affecting our future annual expense and projected benefit obligation 
the rate used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
the weighted average discount rates for our domestic and foreign plans as of december   were and  respectively  compared to and as of december  the decrease in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost would result in an increase in benefit obligation of million and would decrease expense by million 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the market related value of assets 
for the market related value of assets  a calculated basis is used to reflect a smoothed actuarial value of assets  equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period for us plans and a three year period for us plans 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return for our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would result in an increase in our net periodic pension cost of million 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over seventeen years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million 
the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions is recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the period in which they occur

goodwill we review our goodwill for impairment annually in november or when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we will perform a two part impairment test 
in the first step we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the book value 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we perform a second step to value the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and determine goodwill as the residual amount 
we would record an impairment charge to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we assign goodwill to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination 
we have three reportable segments intermec branded products  intermec branded service  and voice solutions 
intermec branded products have no goodwill  intermec branded services and voice solutions each comprise two reporting units 
intermec branded services two reporting units are core service and integrated global services igs 
voice solutions contains the vocollect supply chain and vocollect healthcare reporting units 
in the third quarter of  we determined that certain economic circumstances had changed sufficiently to require an interim impairment testing of goodwill 
specifically  stock market indices declined suddenly and significantly in august and had only recovered minimally by the end of the quarter 
we completed our interim test for impairment of goodwill as of october  and determined goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subsequently  we completed our annual impairment test at november  and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
in testing goodwill for impairment  the analysis utilized a combination of discounted cash flow approach and market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the fair value measurement was calculated using unobservable inputs to the discounted cash flow approach 
the key inputs we used in the discounted cash flow approach include risk adjusted discount rates and future cash flows which include estimates of future revenues and operating costs 
the estimate of future cash flow takes into consideration factors such as growth rates and economic and market information 
these key inputs are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
we assessed the reasonableness of our valuation by considering other information available such as the market capitalization of intermec and other public companies in our industry and associates implied enterprise fair values  projected industry trends and investment analyst reports on us and other public companies in our industry  and information regarding recent acquisitions in our industry 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this new guidance is required to be adopted in january and is to be applied retrospectively 
we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will require either changes to our current financial statements or the addition of an incremental statement 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income which deferred the effective date for the provisions pertaining to reclassification adjustments 
as the new accounting guidance will only amend the presentation requirements of other comprehensive income  we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic asu 
the amendments in this update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this new guidance is required to be adopted in january we anticipate that the adoption of this accounting standard update will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  as it is intended to potentially simplify the assessment for goodwill impairment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we conduct business in approximately countries and generally invoice customers in their local currency  resulting in a foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable balance 
our subsidiaries also purchase certain raw materials and other items in local currencies 
our treasury policies allow us to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures through the purchase of foreign exchange forward contracts 
our policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation 
we enter into foreign exchange forward 
table of contents contracts primarily to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange arising from intercompany transactions  specifically for inventory purchases made by our subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we record these contracts at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change 
these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features 
we attempt to manage the counterparty risk associated with these foreign exchange forward contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have an established banking relationship 
in addition  these contracts generally settle in approximately days 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
the actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  if changes in the timing and amount of currency exchange rate movements and our hedging activities are different from during the year ended december   million or  of our sales were denominated in us dollars  million  or  were denominated in euros  million  or  were denominated in british pounds  and million  or  were denominated in other foreign currencies
