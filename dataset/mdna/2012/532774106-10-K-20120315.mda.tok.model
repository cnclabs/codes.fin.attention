item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we operate or service network affiliates  television station web sites and mobile products in us markets  with multiple network affiliates in markets 
our operating revenues are primarily derived from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers 
additional  but less significant revenues are generated from our television station web sites  retransmission consent fees  interactive revenues and other revenues 
we recorded net income of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our operating highlights for include the following total net revenues decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a million decrease in net political advertising sales  partially offset by a million increase in local revenues  which includes net local advertising sales  retransmission consent fees and television station web site revenues  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was also offset by a million increase in interactive revenues  which includes advertising and media services revenues from our online advertising and media services business  rmm  and our digital advertising management and technology company  nami media 
operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the increase is primarily due to higher direct operating expenses tied to the growth in local revenues and interactive revenues compared to we entered into a new senior secured credit facility  comprised of a six year  million term loan  a seven year  million incremental term loan  and a five year  million revolving credit facility  of which million was drawn against such facility as of the date of this report 
concurrent with the closing of the new senior secured credit facility  we terminated the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility 
on november   we redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes class b 
the redemption of these notes  at par  was funded in part by proceeds from the term loan  the revolving credit facility and cash on hand 
on december   we issued notices to redeem all of the remaining senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b collectively the senior subordinated notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date 
we used proceeds from the incremental term loan under the new senior secured credit facility as described above  and cash on hand to fund the aggregate redemption price 
on december   we irrevocably deposited with the trustee the full amount of the redemption price of our senior subordinated notes 
as of december   the million irrevocable deposit was classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets  and million of our senior subordinated notes  net of a discount of million  remained outstanding 
the redemption was completed on january   and as of that date  there were no senior subordinated notes outstanding 
pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements with nbcuniversal  we made shortfall loans in the aggregate principal amount of million to our joint venture with nbcuniversal 
we have a remaining shortfall funding accrual of million as of december   which we expect to fund during and into on november   we acquired a interest in nami media  a digital advertising management and technology company 
nami media serves the growing marketplace of online traffic quality management for cpc advertising 
our investment in nami media fills a niche in our 
table of contents growing suite of digital product offerings and furthers the goal to be advertisers preferred choice for multiplatform marketing opportunities 
on may   we acquired the assets of wcwf tv in green bay  wi and certain assets of wbdt tv in dayton  oh 
on october   we reached an agreement to sell wwho tv  in columbus  oh  and we completed the sale on february  critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those used for allowance for doubtful accounts in receivables  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  amortization and impairment of program rights and intangible assets  stock based compensation and other long term incentive compensation arrangements  pension costs  barter transactions  income taxes  employee medical insurance claims  useful lives of property and equipment  contingencies  including shortfall funding liabilities to our joint venture with nbcuniversal  litigation and net assets of businesses acquired 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately million  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 
the future value of our broadcast licenses could be significantly impaired by the loss of the corresponding network affiliation agreements 
accordingly  such an event could trigger an assessment of the carrying value of a broadcast license 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash 
table of contents flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing rates in the markets for broadcasters 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  but not more than the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment assessment could be triggered by a significant reduction  or a forecast of such reductions  in operating results or cash flows at one or more of our television stations  a significant adverse change in the national or local advertising marketplaces in which our television stations operate  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among other factors 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
the changes in the discount rate used for our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflected in the table below are primarily driven by changes in the average beta for the public equity of companies in the television and media sector and the average cost of capital in each of the periods 
the changes in the market growth rates and operating profit margins for both our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflect changes in the outlook for advertising revenues in certain markets where our stations operate in each of the periods 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following average industry based assumptions december  december  december  june  market revenue growth operating cash flow margins discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to decrease the market revenue growth rate by and  it would result in an impairment charge of million and million  respectively 
a and decrease in operating profit margins would result in an impairment charge of million and million  respectively 
an increase of and in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of million and million  respectively 
the valuation of goodwill is based on the following assumptions  which take into account our internal projections and industry assumptions related to market revenue growth  operating cash flows and prevailing discount rates december  december  december  june  market revenue growth operating cash flow margins discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and of the projected growth rate  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from 
table of contents the projected operating profit margins  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
network affiliations other broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets by these broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market  the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s are viewed more often than newer television stations  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming  and the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  fox and nbc  each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest primetime audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network s primetime rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are the most important component of the value of a station 
these companies generally believe that television stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network 
table of contents affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different facts and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for establishing or removing a valuation allowance 
we record or subsequently remove a valuation allowance to reflect our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that our determination changes regarding the realization of all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is recorded to our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such a determination is made 
revenue recognition we recognize local  national and political advertising sales  net of agency commissions  during the period in which the advertisements or programs are aired on our television stations  and when payment is reasonably assured 
internet and mobile advertisement sales are recognized when the advertisement is displayed on our web sites or the web sites of our advertising network 
we recognize retransmission consent fees in the period in which our service is delivered 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using a black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation  including the option s expected term  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock option awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected term represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
expected volatility is based on historical trends for our class a common stock over the expected term  and prior to  we used the historical trends of our class a common stock over the expected term  as well as a comparison to peer companies 
expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience 
if future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  our future stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
retirement plan we have historically provided a defined benefit retirement plan to our employees who did not receive matching contributions from our company to their k plan accounts 
our pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
our defined benefit plan is a non contributory plan under which we made contributions either to a traditional plan participants based on periodic actuarial valuations  which are expensed over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees  or b cash balance plan participants based on of each participant s eligible compensation 
effective april   this plan was frozen and we do not expect to make additional benefit accruals to this plan  however we continue to fund our existing vested obligations 

table of contents we contributed million  million and million to our pension plan during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing million to our pension plan in weighted average assumptions used to estimate our pension benefit obligations and to determine our net periodic pension benefit cost are as follows year ended december  discount rate used to estimate our pension benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit cost rate of compensation increase n a n a expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the discount rate for the year ended december   we used a custom bond modeler that develops a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds  rated aa and above by standard poor s  that could be purchased to settle the obligations of the plan 
the yield on this hypothetical portfolio represents a reasonable rate to value our plan liability 
prior to  we used the citigroup pension discount curve to aid in the selection of our discount rate  which we believe reflects the weighted rate of a theoretical high quality bond portfolio consistent with the duration of the cash flows related to our pension liability 
we considered the current levels of expected returns on a risk free investment  the historical levels of risk premium associated with each of our pension asset classes  the expected future returns for each of our pension asset classes and then weighted each asset class based on our pension plan asset allocation to derive an expected long term return on pension plan assets 
during the year ended december   our actual rate of return on plan assets was 
as a result of the plan freeze during  we have no further service cost or amortization of prior service cost related to the plan 
in addition  because the plan is now frozen and participants became inactive during  the net losses related to the plan included in accumulated other comprehensive income are now amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants instead of the average remaining service period 
we expect to record a pension expense of approximately million in for every change in the actual return compared to the expected long term return on pension plan assets and for every change in the actual discount rate compared to the discount rate assumption for  our pension expense would change by million and less than million  respectively 
our investment objective is to achieve a consistent total rate of return that will equal or exceed our actuarial assumptions and to equal or exceed the benchmarks that we use for each of our pension plan asset classes 
the following asset allocation is designed to create a diversified portfolio of pension plan assets that is consistent with our target asset allocation and risk policy target allocation percentage of plan assets as of december  asset category equity securities debt securities 
table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  there were revisions to the accounting standard for goodwill impairment tests 
a company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the revisions are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted during if an entity s financial statements have not yet been issued 
we will adopt this guidance effective january   and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  there were revisions to the accounting standard for reporting comprehensive income 
a company has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the revisions are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
we will adopt this guidance effective january   and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  there were revisions to the accounting standard for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revisions address how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the revisions are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this guidance effective january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations set forth below are the key operating areas that contributed to our results for the years ended december   and our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of wwho tv  in columbus  oh  wupw tv in toledo  oh and the banks broadcasting joint venture station as discontinued for all periods presented 
as a result  reported financial results may not be comparable to certain historical financial information 

table of contents our results of operations are as follows in thousands year ended december  vs vs local revenues national advertising sales political advertising sales interactive revenues other revenues net revenues direct operating selling  general and administrative amortization of program rights corporate depreciation amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses restructuring loss gain from asset dispositions total operating expenses operating income three year comparison net revenues consist primarily of national  local and political advertising sales  net of sales adjustments and agency commissions

net revenues during the year ended december  decreased by million when compared with the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to i a million decrease in political advertising sales  and ii a million decrease in national advertising sales 
these decreases were partially offset by i a million increase in local revenues  and ii a million increase in interactive revenues 
the decrease in political advertising sales during the year ended december   compared to the same period last year  was a result of the congressional  state and local elections in that did not recur in the decrease in national advertising sales was in part due to continued fragmentation of advertising spending across different media platforms 
the increase in local revenues was primarily due to growth in local advertising sales  growth in retransmission consent revenues  primarily as a result of contractual rate increases  and increased advertising on our television station web sites 
the increase in interactive revenues for the year ended december   compared to the same period last year was a result of growth in internet advertising revenues primarily from increased advertising sales from rmm 
the automotive category  which represented of our local and national advertising sales during the year ended december   was essentially flat  as compared to  during which the automotive category represented of our local and national advertising sales 
net revenues during the year ended december  increased by million when compared with the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to i a million increase in political advertising 
table of contents sales  ii a million increase in local revenues  iii a million increase in national advertising sales  iv a million increase in interactive revenues  and v a million increase in other revenues 
the increase in political revenues during the year ended december   compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of congressional  state and local elections which take place in even numbered years as well as growth in issue advertising compared to the prior year 
the increase in local revenues and national advertising sales during was primarily due to economic recovery experienced during compared to the prior year  which resulted in increased advertising spending in our markets 
the increase in local revenues was also due to increased traffic to our web sites  and growth in retransmission consent fees as a result of contractual rate increases in per subscriber fees and an increase in subscriber levels compared to the increase in interactive revenues for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  was due to incremental revenues from the acquisition of rmm in october direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets  which consist primarily of news  engineering and programming expenses  increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  primarily due to higher cost of goods sold related to rmm  and an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements compared to the prior year 
direct operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher cost of goods sold associated with rmm and increases in variable direct costs attributable to the growth in revenue compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  sales commissions  employee benefit costs  advertising  promotional expenses and research 
these costs increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales compensation as a result of growth in our interactive revenues 
additionally  the increase was due in part to a benefit from a litigation settlement that occurred during the year ended december  that did not recur during selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher variable costs attributable to the growth in revenue compared to the prior year and higher employee benefits expense primarily associated with the reinstatement of contributions to the company s k plan starting in selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization of program rights represents the recognition of expense associated with syndicated programming  features and specials  and these costs decreased million  or  for the year ended december  and decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to their respective prior years 
the decrease in both periods was primarily attributable to a decrease in the cost of syndicated programming 
corporate expenses represent corporate executive management  accounting  legal and other costs associated with the centralized management of our stations  and these costs increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increases in legal and professional fees  and stock based compensation 
corporate expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increases in performance bonuses and stock based compensation 

table of contents depreciation expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december  and decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to their respective prior years 
the decreases during and were due to assets that have been fully depreciated compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to certain intangible assets acquired in the rmm acquisition that have been fully amortized compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the rmm acquisition 
impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses reflects non cash impairment charges recorded during the year ended december   which includes an impairment to the carrying values of our broadcast licenses of million and an impairment to the carrying values of our goodwill of million as described further in note intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements 
we also recorded a million impairment charge related to discontinued operations during the year ended december  restructuring charges of million  million and million were recorded during the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of the consolidation of certain activities at our stations 
loss gain from asset dispositions for the year ended december  was million and was primarily attributable to a loss on the disposal of fixed assets 
loss gain from asset dispositions for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the gain in both periods was primarily attributable to a gain on the exchange of certain equipment with sprint nextel of million and million  respectively  both of which were partially offset by a loss on the disposal of fixed assets 
other expense income year ended december  components of other expense income interest expense  net share of loss in equity investments gain loss on derivative instruments loss gain on extinguishment of debt other expense income  net total other expense income  net interest expense  net decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year primarily due to reductions in interest expense on borrowings under our senior secured credit facility as a result of a reduction of balances outstanding under the facility during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our senior notes 
interest expense  net increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the issuance of our senior notes during the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by reductions in interest expense under our senior secured credit 
table of contents facility as a result of reduced balances outstanding under our facility during the following table summarizes our total interest expense  net in thousands year ended december  components of interest expense senior secured credit facility senior notes senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes class b other interest costs total interest expense  net share of loss in equity investments was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and primarily reflects impairment charges relating to accrued loan obligations to our joint venture with nbcuniversal  pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements further described in item business joint venture with nbcuniversal and in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
because of uncertainty surrounding the joint venture s ability to repay any shortfall loans  we recognized a charge of million and million to reflect the impairment of the shortfall loans during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  beginning in  we no longer recognize our approximate share of the joint venture s net loss because the investment was fully impaired during the year ended december   accordingly  we suspended recognition of equity method gains and losses 
gain loss on derivative instruments was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  our derivative instrument consisted of an interest rate hedge agreement entered into during the second quarter of the interest rate hedge to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with a notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans under our senior secured credit facility 
the interest rate hedge effectively converted the floating rate libor based payments under this portion of the facility to fixed payments  however the hedge ceased to be highly effective during as a result of the million repayment of principal on our terms loans  as described further in note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the portion of the fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss  million  was recorded as a charge to our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december   and all changes in fair value have since been recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
the gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  were due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the loss of million for the year ended december  was due to fluctuations in market interest rates and the million charge from accumulated other comprehensive income 
loss gain on extinguishment of debt was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended december  and was due to a write down of deferred financing fees as a result of the payment of principal on our revolving credit facility and term loans as further described in description of indebtedness 
additionally  the loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   includes a write down of deferred financing fees and unamortized discount due to the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes class b as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the gain of million recorded in was related to the purchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes during the year ended december  
table of contents income taxes reflected a benefit from provision for income tax of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our recorded benefit from income tax of million for the year ended december  represents an effective tax rate of compared to a provision for income tax of million for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the fourth quarter reversal of million of our federal valuation allowance relating to to net operating losses  and the fourth quarter reversal of million of our state valuation allowance relating to to net operating losses 
these valuation allowances were reversed primarily due to our recent history of taxable income  and our projected ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of those net operating loss carryforwards 
upon the reversal of the federal and state valuation allowances  as of december   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million placed against our deferred tax assets primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards 
the combined million income tax benefit described above was offset in part by a million discrete deferred income tax expense recognized in the second quarter of  which resulted from state tax legislation enacted in michigan in may  which repealed the michigan business tax mbt  and implemented a corporate income tax instead  effective january as a result of the elimination of the mbt  certain future tax deductions that were available to be utilized beginning in  and had been recognized as deferred tax assets in our financial statements  were no longer deductible 
therefore  during the year ended december   we recognized incremental deferred income tax expense of million  net of federal benefit  for the reversal of these previously established deferred tax assets 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for income tax of million and million  respectively  which represents an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one time impact of various state law changes that occurred in results of discontinued operations our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations  assets and liabilities of wwho tv in columbus  oh  wupw tv in toledo  oh  and the banks broadcasting joint venture station as discontinued for all periods presented 
as a result  loss income from discontinued operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for further information see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and to utilize borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
our ability to make use of the revolving credit facility is contingent on our compliance with certain financial covenants  which are measured  in part  by the level of ebitda we generate from our operations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under our senior secured credit facility 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  and a million revolving credit facility  of which million was available 
we had restricted cash balances of million  which were used to redeem  on january   all of the remaining senior subordinated notes and to pay accrued interest through the redemption date 
below is a discussion of our significant sources and uses of cash and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our net revenues and changes in working capital as a result of the timing of collections and payments 
our total net revenues has primarily been  and will primarily be affected by  among other things  the following continued growth in local and interactive revenues 
during the years ended december  and  our local revenues  which include net local advertising sales  retransmission consent fees and revenues from our television station web sites and mobile applications  increased and  respectively  compared to the prior year 
additionally  during the years ended december  and  our interactive revenues increased and  respectively  which are generated by our online advertising and media services business  rmm and nami media  our digital advertising management and technology company 
we expect further growth in our local revenues and interactive revenues  however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
cyclical fluctuations 
we experience significant fluctuations in our political advertising revenues since advertising revenues are generally higher in even numbered years due to additional revenues associated with political advertising related to local and national elections 
political advertising revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also experience incremental advertising revenues associated with olympic broadcasts during even numbered years 
we anticipate increased advertising revenues during as a result of these cyclical fluctuations 
additionally  the us supreme court s ruling in that allowed for unlimited independent political expenditures from corporations and unions may further increase political advertising spending in even numbered years 
other items impacting our cash flow from operations include employee benefit contributions 
our employee benefit plan contributions include contributions to our pension plan and the k plan 
volatility in the equity markets impacts the fair value of our pension plan assets and ultimately the cash funding requirements of our pension plan 
we contributed million  million and million to our pension plan during the years ended december   and  respectively  and anticipate contributing million to our pension plan during effective january   we resumed contributions to the k plan  whereby we provide a non elective contribution to all eligible employees 
we contributed approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  and expect to contribute approximately million to our k plan during payments related to certain restructuring activities 
we made cash payments related to certain restructuring initiatives of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
for further details on these restructuring initiatives see note restructuring to our consolidated financial statements 
investing activities cash used in investing activities has primarily been  and will primarily be affected by  among other things  the following capital expenditures 
capital expenditures increased million to million  and increased million to million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during the year ended december   which we expect to fund using cash flows from operations 

table of contents cash requirements related to the nbcuniversal joint venture 
during the years ended december  and  pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements  we made shortfall loans in an aggregate principal amount of million  representing our approximate share in debt service shortfalls 
as of december   we have an accrued shortfall funding liability of million for our approximate share of debt service shortfalls that we expect to fund during and into we believe that cash shortfalls beyond the amounts currently accrued are not probable 
actual cash shortfalls at the joint venture could vary from our current estimates 
for further information about the joint venture with nbcuniversal  the estimate of our shortfall funding liability  and the shortfall funding agreements  see item a
