item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a holding company which conducts operations through our wholly owned china subsidiaries 
our business is conducted and reported in three segments  namely  bromine  crude salt and chemical products 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  schc  we produce and trade bromine and crude salt 
we are one of the largest producers of bromine in china  as measured by production output 
elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture 
bromine also is used to form intermediary chemical compounds such as tmb bromine is commonly used in brominated flame retardants  fumigants  water purification compounds  dyes  medicines and disinfectants 
crude salt is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical  food beverage  and other industries 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  syci  we manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration  oil and gas distribution  oil field drilling  wastewater processing  papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals 
on december   we acquired  through a share exchange  upper class group limited  a british virgin islands holding corporation which then owned all of the outstanding shares of schc 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the share exchange is considered to be a capital transaction in substance  rather than a business combination 
that is  the share exchange is equivalent to the issuance of stock by upper class for the net assets of our company  accompanied by a recapitalization  and is accounted for as a change in capital structure 
accordingly  the accounting for the share exchange was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition  except no goodwill was recorded 
under reverse takeover accounting  the post reverse acquisition comparative historical financial statements of the legal acquirer  our company  are those of the legal acquiree  upper class group limited  which is considered to be the accounting acquirer 
share and per share amounts reflected in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on february   we  acting through schc  acquired syci 
since the ownership of gulf resources  inc and syci was then substantially the same  the transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  whereby we recognized the assets and liabilities of syci at their carrying amounts 
share and per share amounts stated in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on august   syci completed the construction of a new chemical production line 
it passed the examination by shouguang city administration of work safety and local fire department 
this new production line focuses on producing environmental friendly additive products  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration 
the line has an annual production capacity of  tons 
formal production of this chemical production line started on september  on october  we completed a for reverse stock split of our common stock  such that for each four shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split 
all shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split figures 
on october  our shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol gfre and on june  we changed our ticker symbol to gure to better reflection of our corporate name 
as a result of our acquisitions of schc and syci  our historical financial statements and the information presented below reflects the accounts of schc and syci 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  years ended december  december  change net revenue   cost of net revenue   gross profit   sales  marketing and other operating expense   research and development costs   exploration costs  write off impairment on property  plant and equipment  general and administrative expenses   other operating income   income from operations   other income  net   income before taxes   income taxes   net income   net revenue net revenue for the fiscal year  was  representing an increase of  or over the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to i the growth in our bromine segment  in which revenue increased from  for the fiscal year to  for the same period in  an increase of approximately  and ii the strong growth in our crude salt segment  in which revenue increased from  for the fiscal year to  for the same period in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in net revenue was partially offset by the decrease in our chemical products segment  in which net revenue decreased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
net revenue by segment vs 
year ended year ended percent change december  december  of net revenue segment percent of total percent of total bromine   crude salt   chemical products   total sales   years ended december percentage change bromine and crude salt segments product sold in tonnes increase decrease bromine excluded volume sold to syci   crude salt   years ended december percentage change chemical products segment sold in tonnes increase decrease oil and gas exploration additives   paper manufacturing additives   pesticides manufacturing additives   wastewater treatment chemical additives bromine segment the increase in net revenue from our bromine segment was mainly due to the increase in the average selling price of bromine 
the average selling price of bromine increased from  per tonne for fiscal year to  per tonne for the same period in  an increase of 
the increase in the average selling price was a result of i strong demand in the china market following the recovery of business and economic conditions and reforms in the medical industry in china  and ii expansion of bromine applications in a variety of industries 
however  we noted that the effect of the increase in the average selling price was diminished due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government which weakened the demand of bromine beginning in the second half of the average selling of bromine decreased from a high in the first quarter of  per tonne to the lowest in the third quarter of  per tonne  and kept stable in the fourth quarter of  per tonne 
we expect the average selling price of bromine will remain at current levels around  per tonne through the first half of should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remain in place 
the favorable effect of the increase in the average selling price of bromine was almost offset by a decrease in the sales volume of bromine from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
despite an increase in the number of our bromine production plants in recent years  sales volume of bromine decreased 
the reasons for the decrease in the sales volume of bromine was mainly attributable to i the drop in overall demand for bromine as a result of the recent macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government beginning in the second half of to slow down the economy  ii less bromine being extracted from brine water during the production process due to the trend of a decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted at our facilities  and iii the suspension of operations of our original factory no 
in early july to cooperate with the demolition of the factory and construction of new factory  which resumed normal production in late november the table below showed the changes in the average selling price of bromine and changes in the sales volume of bromine for fiscal year from fiscal year increase decrease in net revenue of bromine as a result of vs 
increase in average selling price  decrease in sales volume  total effect on net revenue of bromine  in an effort to address the trend of a decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted at our facilities  we carried out enhancement projects to our extraction wells in june by increasing the depth of our brine water wells to extract brine water from a lower second layer which we believe will have a higher bromine concentration 
yet  the result of the enhancement projects was not reflected in fiscal year as the overall demand of bromine decreased due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government 
crude salt segment the increase in net revenue from our crude salt segment was mainly due to the increase in the average selling price of crude salt 
the average selling price of crude salt increased from per tonne for fiscal year to per tonne for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in the average selling price was a result of increased demand for crude salt and the increase in our production capacity was a result of the additional crude salt field we acquired in late the favorable effect of the increase in the average selling price of crude salt was partially offset by a decrease in the sales volume of crude salt from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in average selling price was a result of the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government beginning in the second half of to slow down the economy  which decreased the demand for crude salt for downstream production of chlorine alkali and use in chemical  food and beverage industries 
the decrease in sales volume also was a result of the decrease in sales volume of bromine in fiscal year  which reduced the wastewater available for the production of crude salt 
the table below shows the changes in the average selling price and changes in the sales volume of crude salt for fiscal year from fiscal year increase decrease in net revenue of crude salt as a result of vs 
increase in average selling price  decrease in sales volume  total effect on net revenue of crude salt  despite the above increasing factor  we noted a trend of decrease in the average selling price of crude salt for fiscal year the average selling price decreased from per tonne in the first quarter of to per tonne in the fourth quarter of we expect the average selling price of crude salt will remain at current levels through the first half of should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remain in place 
chemical products segment product mix of chemical product segment vs 
year ended year ended percent change december  december  of net revenue chemical products percent of total percent of total oil and gas exploration additives  paper manufacturing additives   pesticides manufacturing additives  wastewater treatment chemical products  total sales   revenues from our chemical products segment decreased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the drop in demand for our oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives 
our oil and gas exploration chemicals are the most popular products within our chemical products segment and contributed  or and  or of our chemical segment revenue for fiscal years and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
net revenue from our agricultural intermediates increased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year  an increase of approximately 
we believe that as result of the recent macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  the overall demand for chemical products was reduced  which resulted in a decrease in our volume of chemical products sold 
the sales volume of chemical products decreased by from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year however  the effect of the decrease in net revenue from our chemical products segment was partially offset by the increase in the average selling price for all of our chemical products due to the continuing high level of oil prices 
the average selling price per tonne for our chemical products increased by a range of paper manufacturing additives to pesticides manufacturing additives for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year in particular  the prc government continued to support expansion of agricultural related products  which supported the growth in sales of our pesticides manufacturing additives 
also  in june we stopped production of our wastewater treatment chemical additive and in july we successfully converted the production equipment from this wastewater treatment chemical additive to pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical additives which have higher profit margins 
the table below shows the changes in the average selling price and changes in the sales volume of our major chemical products  other than wastewater treatment chemical additive  for fiscal years and increase decrease in net revenue of major chemical products  for fiscal year vs 
 as a result of oil and gas exploration additives paper manufacturing additives pesticides agricultural additives total increase in average selling price   decrease in sales volume   total effect on net revenue of chemical products  cost of net revenue cost of net revenue by segment change year ended year ended of cost of december  december  net revenue segment percent of total percent of total bromine   crude salt   chemical products   total cost of net revenue   cost of net revenue reflects mainly the raw materials consumed and the direct salaries and benefits of staff engaged in the production process  electricity  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and other manufacturing costs 
our cost of net revenue was  for fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the increase in the purchase price of raw materials  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery  mineral resource compensation fees paid for extraction of brine water in our bromine segment and price adjustment fund imposed by the local prc government to our bromine and crude salt segments 
bromine production capacity and utilization of our factories the table below represents the annual capacity and utilization ratios for our all of our bromine producing properties annual production capacity utilization ratio in tonnes fiscal year  fiscal year  adjusted included factory acquired in early fiscal year  variance of fiscal year adjusted vs 
 annual production capacities for were estimated by management  and the annual production capacity for was extracted from an appraisal report carried out by an international appraisal firm  grant sherman appraisal limited  in october utilization ratio is calculated based on the annualized actual production volume in tonnes for the year divided by the annual production capacity in tonnes 
since  we continued to acquire bromine properties to increase the production capacity to meet demand 
however  the cost of obtaining additional production capacity in recent years increased significantly due to the limited availability of suitable bromine facilities 
prior to  we acquired production facilities at costs of approximately million or  per ton production capacity  with annual production capacity increased by  tons from initially  tons 
in and  we acquired further production facilities at costs of approximately million and million for additional  tons or  per ton production capacity and  tons or  per ton production capacity annual production capacity  respectively 
in  we acquired another facility and incurred capital improvement for bromine and crude salt production in at costs of million with additional bromine annual production capacity of  tons or  per ton production capacity 
the cost per ton production capacity acquired in is comparatively lower than the factories acquired prior to because the term of lease for the newly acquired facility only lasts for years  where the lease term for factories acquired before were all year lease terms 
the latest acquired cost per ton production capacity would be increased to  if the lease term would have been years 
in view of the recent trend of a decrease in bromine concentration of brine water being extracted in shandong areas  we determined that the existing annual production capacity information previously estimated by the management at the time of acquisition of the respective factory may not accurately reflect the current production and information available 
as a result  we hired an international appraisal firm  grant sherman international limited  to reassess all of our bromine facilities in october and concluded that our optimal annual production capacity in given our current situation was  tons  a decrease of  tons annually as compared to the annual production capacity in  which included additional  tons production capacity acquired in early the decrease in our overall annual bromine production capacity was mainly attributable to active aging of bromine facilities  in particular  certain protective shells for the crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  which increased the leakage rate and directly reduced the volume of brine water available to flow into the bromine production cycle  and a trend of decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted from our existing extraction wells 
in order to reduce the leakage rate and attempt to recover the annual production capacity of bromine and crude salt to a higher level in the future  we decided to carry out large scale enhancement work to replace all the eroded protective shells within a four year timeframe  which work commenced in the second quarter of the priority of the enhancement work depends upon the rate of corrosion at each factory 
in fiscal year  we incurred costs of million for such enhancement projects  which included drilling certain existing extraction wells into deeper underground for higher bromine concentration of brine water at a cost of approximately million  and replacing certain eroded protective shells to the crude salt fields  and transmission channels and ducts with new ones at costs of approximately million and million 
the enhancement work for all of our crude salt fields protective shells was completed in  and the company is not expected to carry out such enhancement works to the fields during the course of the next years 
the table below summarizes the schedule for enhancement work to the protective shells to extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts in the next three years 
enhancement work timetable to total no 
of wells length of channels and ducts completed by end of to be done in to be done in to be done in expected costs for each year of to in extractive wells  wells protective shells for transmission channels and ducts  meters the optimal annual bromine production capacity of  tons for  as reassessed by the international appraisal firm in october  only partially reflected the enhancement work for the extraction wells  protective shells for transmission channels and ducts performed in the second quarter of nevertheless  our annual production capacity still recorded a decrease of  tons as compared with management s prior estimates 
although this decline is not insignificant  we believe that the situation would have been worse if we have not started to carry out the enhancement work in the second quarter of  as we anticipated that this trend in bromine concentration of brine water in the shandong areas will continue and the leakage rate of our aged protective shells for transmission channels and ducts would continue to adversely affect our bromine production capacity in the future 
to remedy and recover our annual bromine production capacity  we will continue to carry out the remaining enhancement work to the extraction wells  and protective shells for transmission channels and ducts in the next three years at expected annual costs of million 
the management considered that the protective shells for the crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts are individual components that can be separately identified for replacement  while the enhancement costs incurred increases the future service potential of the extraction wells  crude salts fields and transmission channels and ducts 
the original eroded protective shells were replaced and removed from the fixed assets 
the management estimated that the enhancement projects for extraction wells and protection shells for the crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts will have useful lives of and years  respectively 
as such  the company capitalized the enhancement components as separate fixed asset items and depreciated with their useful lives of to years 
our utilization ratio decreased by for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the decrease in utilization and hence the sales volume of bromine was mainly attributable to i the suspension of operations of our original factory no 
in early july to cooperate with the demolition of the factory and construction of a new factory  which was completed its construction and resumed normal operations in late november  and ii intermittent suspension of operations of some of our factories in the first half of due to the annual scheduled repair and maintenance  the increased number of environmental inspections by the local government and the restriction of the supply of electricity to all industrial factories by the local government 
we estimated that the amount of ordinary repair and maintenance expense will be million in as normal operations of our bromine and crude salt  most of our fixed assets require less daily repair and maintenance 
these kinds of plant and equipment include the crude salt fields  channels and ducts  and extraction wells 
without altering the foundation of these assets  the protective shells attached to the foundation are required to be replaced with their life cycle  which is around every to years 
the ordinary repairs and maintenance costs incurred during each year represents mainly the costs of spare parts of manufacturing machinery and pumps for bromine extraction  and salaries for repair and maintenance department 
bromine segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our bromine segment was  an increase of  or compared to  for the fiscal year the most significant components of our cost of net revenue for the bromine segment were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or for fiscal year the major components of the cost of revenue for fiscal year were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or  a similar cost structure as compared with the same in the increase in cost of net revenue was attributable to the increase in raw material prices and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the table below represents the major production cost component of bromine per ton for respective periods year ended year ended december  december  change percent of total percent of total raw materials  depreciation and amortization electricity others production cost of bromine per ton   our production cost of bromine per ton was  for the fiscal year  an increase of or as compared to the fiscal year  which attributable mainly to the components of raw material and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the cost of raw material consumed per ton increased by as compared to last comparison period mainly attributable to the increase in the purchase price of raw materials 
the significant percentage increase in depreciation and amortization per ton by was due to the enhancement projects in late june to our crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shell and transmission channels and ducts from years to years  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
since january  included in our others production cost was a price adjustment fund  a levy charged by prc government  of per tonne 
crude salt segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our crude salt segment was  representing an increase of  or  over the same period in the increase in cost was mainly due to the increase in the number of crude salt fields and enhancement projects performed in late june  which in turn increased the depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the significant costs were depreciation and amortization of  or  resource tax calculated based on the crude salt sold of  or and electricity of  or for the fiscal year the major cost components were depreciation and amortization of  or  resource tax calculated based on the crude salt sold of  or and electricity of  or for fiscal year the table below represents the major production cost component of crude salt per ton for respective periods year ended year ended december  december  change percent of total percent of total depreciation and amortization resource tax electricity others production cost of crude salt per ton our production cost of crude salt per ton was for the fiscal year  an increase of or as compared to the same period in  which attributable mainly to the components of depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and introduction of price adjustment fund since january the significant percentage increase in depreciation and amortization per ton by was due to the enhancement projects period in late june to our crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shell and transmission channels and ducts from years to years  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
since january  included in our others production cost was a price adjustment fund  a levy charged by prc government  of per tonne 
other production costs represented mainly salaries and welfare of labor worked in the crude salt fields 
chemical products segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our chemical products segment was  representing a decrease of  or over the same period in the rate of decrease for the cost of net revenue for our chemical products segment was similar to that of net revenue 
the significant costs were cost of raw material and finished goods consumed of  or and  or and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and  or for each of the fiscal years and  respectively 
as the components of our cost of net revenue are fixed levels of depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and the inflated purchase price of raw materials  the overall cost of net revenue for chemical products segment remained at a same level for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year gross profit gross profit was  or  of net revenue for fiscal year compared to  or  of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a drop in margin percentage to all of our three segments 
gross profit by segment point year ended year ended change of december  december  gross profit segment percent of net revenue percent of net revenue bromine   crude salt   chemical products   total gross profit   bromine segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our bromine segment was compared to for the fiscal year the average selling price of bromine increased from  per tonne for fiscal year to  per tonne for fiscal year  an increase of 
we do not expect that the selling price for bromine will continue to increase in as mentioned before  due to a decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted and the prc government s macro economic tightening policy  our production level and sales volume for the second half of was adversely affected 
in order to improve the quality of brine water being extracted from our wells  we completed enhancements of our facilities during the second quarter of to pump brine water from deeper underground 
we expect that the production capacity of bromine will improve in the near future as a result of these enhancements and that the gross profit margin of bromine will remain at current level through the first half of should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remains in place 
crude salt segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our crude salt segment was compared to for the fiscal year this decrease in our gross profit margin is attributable to i the increase in depreciation and amortization of manufacturing facilities as a result of the enhancement projects performed in late june to our crude fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  and ii the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shells and transmission channels and ducts from years to years 
for the fiscal year  the average selling price of crude salt increased to per ton  as compared from per ton in the fiscal year  an increase of 
as mentioned hereinbefore  the increase in average selling price was a result of increased demand of crude salt which was offset by the increase in cost of net revenue 
chemical products segment the gross profit margin for our chemical products segment for the fiscal year was compared to for the fiscal year  a decrease of 
as mentioned hereinbefore  the decrease in gross profit margin was a result of the decrease in demand for our oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives which in turn reduced the sales volume of these chemical products 
as sales of oil and gas exploration additives contributed more than of our total chemical products segment s net revenue  the decrease in demand largely reduced the gross profit margin of our chemical products segment 
however  our factory is capable of producing diversified chemical products  the selling price fluctuation of individual chemical products is not expected to have an impact on our gross profit margin for overall chemical products 
research and development costs the total research and development costs incurred for the fiscal years and were  and  respectively  with a decrease of 
included in research and development costs are costs paid to east china university of science and technology for the establishment of a co op research and development center in june to develop new bromine based chemical compounds and products to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry 
on june   syci and east china university of science and technology mutually agreed to terminate the co op research agreement due to the successful completion of the cooperative research and development tasks related to the development of bromine related chemical products for us 
the research and development costs paid pursuant to this agreement amounted to  and  for the fiscal years and  respectively 
since the second quarter of  syci conducted research for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives  the purpose of which is for the testing the manufacturing routine and samples 
the research and development expenses incurred for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives during the fiscal years and were  and  respectively 
the new production line began operations in april however  we switched the aforesaid production line to the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical intermediates in mid june as we experienced some technological limitations on extraction purity  which lead to a lower than expected gross margin for wastewater treatment chemical additives 
the converted new production line was started operation and normal production in late july with positive cash from operations 
exploration costs to explore natural brine resources in sichuan province  schc incurred exploration costs in the amount of  for the fiscal year these costs consisted of the drilling of exploratory wells and associated facilities in order to confirm and measure the brine water resources in the province 
we charged the exploration costs to the income statement as incurred 
we completed the drilling of the first exploratory well in december and announced in mid january that we have discovered underground brine water resources in daying county  and provided preliminary concentration results after the testing by a third party independent testing expert 
according to the third party independent testing report  the bromine concentration in the underground brine water resources is grams per liter  which is approximately six to seven times higher than the average bromine concentration from its brine water resources at our bromine factories in shouguang city 
we expects to continue to cooperate with daying county in and drilling in order to further determine the total brine water resources reserve and exploitable amount in the area 
write off impairment on property  plant and equipment the write off and impairment on property  plant and equipment represented i the write off on property  plant and equipment that could not be relocated to the new factory no 
in the amount of  ii the impairment loss on property  plant and equipment related to the conversion of our production line from wastewater treatment chemical additives to the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical intermediates in the amount of  iii the impairment loss on property  plant and equipment under capital leases for idle plant and machinery in the amount of  and iv the write off of certain crude salt field protective shells and transmission pipelines replaced during renovation work in the amounts of  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or compared to  for the same period in the significant increase was primarily due to non cash expenses of  for the fiscal year related to options granted to our employees in the amount of  recognition of non vested options which were cancelled in late september in the amount of  and a warrant issued to our investor relations firm in the amount of  related to a the service agreement signed in february the non cash expenses related to options and a warrant granted for the fiscal year amounted to  which resulted in an increase of  or  as compared with the fiscal year the increase in stock options was primarily for the purpose of incentivizing our employees 
other reasons for the increase in general and administrative expenses were due to i demolition and re installation expense in the amount of  for relocating factory no 
due to the chinese government taking the leased land  where our original factory no 
was situated  for civil redevelopment  ii  of depreciation of property  plant and equipment for factory no 
which were temporarily suspended operations due to the relocation  iii  of unrealized exchange loss in relation to the translation difference of inter company balances in usd and rmb  and iv  of consultancy fee paid to an unrelated prc agent for the purpose of searching suitable crude salt fields and bromine properties for acquisition 
other operating income other operating income was  for the fiscal year  a significant increase of  from  for the fiscal year such increase was primarily due to i a sum of  received from the local prc government in third quarter of as compensation for the demolition of our original factory no 
 and ii a sum of  for compensation received from a legal case 
included in other operating income for the fiscal years and were  and  income from sales of wastewater to some of our customers 
not all of our bromine production plants have sufficient area on the property to allow for evaporation of wastewater to produce crude salt 
certain of our customers who have facilities located adjacent to our bromine production plants have agreed to channel our wastewater into brine pans on their properties for evaporation 
these customers then are able to sell the resulting crude salt themselves 
we have signed agreements with three of our customers to sell them our wastewater at market prices 
income from operations income from operations was  for the fiscal year or of net revenue  a decrease of  or approximately over income from operations for the fiscal year the decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in net revenue as a result of i the macro economies tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  which in turn decrease the demand and selling price of our products  and ii a non cash expense of  related to cancellation of all non vested stock options in late september as explained hereinbefore 
income from operations by segment year ended december  year ended december  percent of total percent of total segment bromine   crude salt   chemical products   income from operations before corporate costs  corporate costs   income from operations   bromine segment income from operations from our bromine segment was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately compared to the same period in despite the effect of increase in bromine s selling price which contributed an increase of approximately million in income from operations  the overall decrease in income from operations bromine segment resulted primarily from i the decrease in sales volume contributed a decrease of approximately million as a result of the prc government s macro economies tightening policy which decrease the demand of bromine  ii the increase in cost of net revenue  in particular  cost of raw material and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery contributed a decrease of approximately million  iii the impairment losses and write off of certain property  plant and equipment contributed a decrease of approximately million  and iv the increase in exploration costs to explore natural brine resources in sichuan province contributed a decrease of approximately million 
crude salt segment income from operations from our crude salt segment was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately compared to the fiscal year this decrease was mainly due to i the impairment losses and write off of certain property  plant and equipment of approximately million  and ii the increase in exploration costs to explore natural brine resources in sichuan province of approximately million  which outweighed the increase in net revenue of approximately million 
chemical segment income from operations from our chemical products segment was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately compared to the fiscal year this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in net revenue of our oil and gas exploration chemicals and paper manufacturing additives of approximately million due to the decreased demand  and ii the impairment losses and write off of certain property  plant and equipment of approximately million  which was partially offset by i the increase in net revenue of our agricultural intermediates of approximately million  ii the net revenue from wastewater treatment chemical products of approximately million  and iii the decrease in our research and development costs incurred and paid to east china university of science and technology of approximately million as explained hereinbefore 
other income  net other income represented bank interest income  net of the capital lease interest expense 
the decrease in net other income was primarily due to the charge of capital lease interest expense since january for the acquisition of fixed assets under capital lease 
net income net income was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately compared to the fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to the impairment losses recognized for and the write off of certain property  plant and equipment of approximately million  exploration costs related to the drilling of exploratory wells in sichuan province of approximately million and recognition of non vested options which cancelled in late september of approximately million 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was  represented an increase of as compared to the same periods in the significant increase in the effective tax rate was due to the us federal net operating loss incurred by gulf during in respect of the non cash expenses of  for the fiscal year related to the recognition of non vested options granted to employees which were cancelled in late september we considered that such non cash expense is a one off item and did not anticipate this will be a recurring item in the future

the average selling price of bromine increased from  per ton for the fiscal year to  per ton for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in average selling price was a result of i strong demand for brominated flame retardants  fumigants  water purification compounds  dyes  medicines  and disinfectants in the china market following the recovery of business and economic conditions and reforms in the medical industry in china  ii expansion of bromine applications in a variety of industries for cleaning up sulfur and mercury from polluted areas and wastewater treatment  iii no major cost effective substitute for bromine in the pharmaceutical area  iv strong domestic consumption as historically limited bromine was imported into china  and v no new bromine reserves were discovered in and however  the sales volume of bromine decreased from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
despite an increase in the number of our bromine production plants in recent years  sales volume of bromine decreased 
the decrease in the sales volume of bromine was attributable to less bromine being extracted from brine water during the production process due to a trend of a decrease in bromine concentration of brine water being extracted 
in addition  during  the local government also restricted the supply of electricity to our factories and there was an increase in the number of environmental inspections of our factories made by the local government

increase in average selling price  decrease in sales volume  total effect on net revenue of bromine  crude salt segment the increase in net revenue from our crude salt segment was mainly due to the increase in both the average selling price and sales volume of crude salt 
the sales volume of crude salt slightly increased by  from  tonnes for fiscal year to  tonnes for fiscal year  and the average selling price of crude salt increased from approximately per ton to above per ton  an increase of approximately 
the increase in average selling price was a result of increased demand for crude salt for downstream production of chlorine alkali and use in chemical  food and beverage industries 
before  our sales volume was restricted by our limited production capacity 
we acquired factories factories no 
 between mid and mid  which increased our productivity  and increased the volume of crude salt we sold

the increase was mainly due to the strong demand for environmentally friendly oil and gas exploration chemicals and agricultural intermediaries 
our oil and gas exploration chemicals are the most popular products within the chemical products segment  which contributed  or and  or of our chemical segment revenue for fiscal year and  respectively  with an increase of  or 
as result of the recent macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government in second half of to slow down the economy  our overall demand for chemical additives was reduced  which slowed down our increase of revenue in oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives for the whole year in however  revenue from our agricultural intermediates increased from  for fiscal year to  for the same period in  an increase of  or approximately 
the prc government continues to support expansion of agricultural related products  which supported the growth in sales of pesticides manufacturing additives in the table below showed the changes in the average selling price of major chemical products and changes in the sales volume of crude salt for fiscal year from increase decrease in net revenue of chemical products  for fiscal year vs

cost of net revenue cost of net revenue by segment change year ended year ended of cost of december  december  net revenue segment percent of total percent of total bromine   crude salt   chemical products   total cost of net revenue   cost of net revenue reflects mainly the raw materials consumed and the direct salaries and benefits of staff engaged in the production process  electricity  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and other manufacturing costs 
our cost of net revenue was  in fiscal year  an increase of approximately million or approximately from the cost of net revenue in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the increase in purchase price in raw materials  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and mineral resources compensation fees paid for extraction of brine water in bromine segment 
the rate of increase for cost of net revenue was lower than that of net revenue because i the rate of inflation relating to cost of net revenue was lower than the percentage increase in selling price of our products and ii the leverage of bulk purchases of raw materials which partially lowered the percentage of increase in price of raw materials 
bromine production capacity and utilization of our factories the table below represents the annual capacity and utilization ratios for our bromine producing properties annual production capacity utilization ratio in tonnes fiscal year  fiscal year  variance of fiscal year vs 
 utilization ratio is calculated based on the annualized actual production volume in tonnes for the year divided by the annual production capacity in tonnes 
despite the fact that we acquired factory no 
in which increased our annual bromine production capacity by  tones  our utilization decreased by in the decrease in utilization and hence the sales volume of bromine was mainly attributable to less bromine being extracted from brine water during the production process due to a trend of decrease in bromine concentration of brine water being extracted 
in addition  during  the local government also restricted the supply of electricity to our factories and there was an increase in the number of environmental inspections of our factories made by the local government 
bromine segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for the bromine segment was  representing an increase of  or over the same period in the most significant components of our cost of net revenue for the bromine segment were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or for the fiscal year for the fiscal year  the major components of the cost of net revenue were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or  a similar cost structure as compared with the same in the increase in cost of net revenue was attributable to the increase in raw material prices 
the table below represents the major production cost component of bromine per ton for respective periods year ended year ended december  december  change percent of total percent of total raw materials depreciation and amortization electricity others production cost of bromine per ton   our production cost of bromine per ton was  for the fiscal year  an increase of or over the same period in  which attributable mainly to the components of raw materials and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the cost of raw materials consumed per ton increased by as compared to last comparison period mainly due to increase in the purchase price of raw materials 
the rate of increase for cost of net revenue was lower than that of net revenue because i the supply of raw materials is relatively stable and the rate of increase in the price of raw materials was lower compared with the rate of increase in the selling price of bromine and ii bulk purchases of raw materials partially lowered the percentage of increase in the price of raw materials 
the increase in electricity consumed and depreciation and amortization reflected our expansion of the number of production plants of bromine through acquisitions in and crude salt segment the cost of net revenue for the crude salt segment for the fiscal year was  an increase of  or compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the number of our crude salt fields for evaporation of crude salt  which increased the corresponding variable costs  such as resource taxes paid and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the significant cost components for the fiscal year were depreciation and amortization of  or  resource tax calculated based on the crude salt sold of  or and electricity of  or

the increase in electricity consumed and depreciation and amortization reflected our expansion of the number of crude salt fields through acquisitions in and other production costs represented mainly salaries and welfare of labor worked in the crude salt fields 
chemical products segment cost of net revenue for the fiscal year  was  representing an increase of  or over the same period in the significant costs were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or and  and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and  or for each of the fiscal years and  respectively 
our raw materials consumed mainly composed of chemical elements  including bromine  and their costs were increased over this year due to the strong in demand 
the rate of increase for the cost of net revenue for chemical products segment was similar to that of net revenue 
gross profit gross profit was  or  of net revenue for fiscal year compared to  or  of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a rise of margin percentage in our bromine and crude salt segments 
gross profit by segment point year ended year ended change of december  december  gross profit segment percent of net revenue percent of net revenue bromine   crude salt   chemical products   total gross profit   bromine segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our bromine segment was compared to for fiscal year the increase in gross profit margin is mainly attributable to the increase in average selling price  which is partially offset by an increase in cost of raw materials and a decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted 
for the fiscal year  the average selling price of bromine increased from  per ton to  per ton compared to the fiscal year  an increase of 
as mentioned before  due to a decrease in the bromine concentration of brine water being extracted limited our production capacity for we expect the trend will continue in crude salt segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our crude salt segment was compared to for the same period in for the fiscal year  the average selling price of crude salt increased to per ton  as compared from per ton in the fiscal year  an increase of 
as mentioned hereinbefore  the increase in average selling price was a result of increased demand of crude salt and the increase in the gross profit margin of crude salt was mainly due to the acquisition of a crude salt field in and three factories between mid and mid factories no 
to which increased our productivity of crude salt and economies of scale 
chemical products segment the gross profit margin for chemical products segment remained stable for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year as our factory is capable of producing diversified chemical products  the selling price fluctuation of individual chemical products is not expected to have an impact on our gross profit margin for overall chemical products 
research and development costs research and development costs result from the agreement that syci and east china university of science and technology entered in june to establish a co op research and development center to develop new bromine based chemical compounds and products to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry 
all research findings and patents developed by this center will belong to gulf resources 
since the second quarter of  syci conducted research for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives  the purpose of which is for the testing the manufacturing routine and samples 
the research and development expense incurred for the aforesaid new production line from outside parties and the use of schc s products during the fiscal year were  and  respectively 
the total research and development costs incurred for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately  from the general and administrative expenses of  during fiscal year this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to i the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of approximately million for the fiscal year  as compared to approximately million for fiscal year  and ii the increase in salary and welfare payments  depreciation  and land duty and franchise tax by approximately million 
during the year ended december   we incurred a loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment of approximately million fiscal year million as the equipment being disposed of was specialized equipment used in the bromine and chemical production industry which has few suppliers and an inactive second hand market  which resulted in low second hand price 
in order to take advantage of the increasing demand for environmentally friendly chemical products produced from bromine  we intend to focus our future chemical production on environmentally friendly products  and therefore  have disposed of certain machinery and equipment that has been used for other products 
also  in order to enhance our bromine production process  we disposed of certain outdated auxiliary machinery 
such increment was partly offset by the decrease in non cash expenses related to stock options granted to our employees and a warrant granted to our investor relations firm by approximately other operating income other operating income was  for the fiscal year  which represented the income from sales of wastewater to some of our customers since march wastewater is generated from the production of bromine which eventually becomes crude salt when it evaporates 
not all of our bromine production plants have sufficient area on the property to allow for evaporation of wastewater to produce crude salt 
certain of our customers who have facilities located adjacent to our bromine production plants have agreed to channel our wastewater into brine pans on their properties for evaporation 
these customers then are able to sell the resulting crude salt themselves 
we have signed agreements with three of our customers to sell them our wastewater at market prices 
income from operations income from operations was  in fiscal year or of net revenue  an increase of  or approximately over income from operations in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue and relatively lower increase in cost of net revenue as explained hereinbefore

crude salt segment income from operations of crude salt segment was  for the fiscal year or of the segment s income from operations  an increase of  or approximately compared with the fiscal year the increase in the income from operations of crude salt was mainly due to i the increase in the selling price of crude salt  which contributed an increase of million  and ii the increase in sales volume  which contributed an increase of another million 
chemical segment in fiscal year  income from operations in the chemical products segment was  a slight decrease of from  in fiscal year the decrease in income from operations of our chemical products was due to the extensive research and development costs incurred for the new production line of wastewater treatment additives for fiscal year which offset increases in revenue from our environmentally friendly oil and gas exploration chemicals and agricultural intermediaries other income  net other income was  for fiscal year  an increase of  as compared to fiscal year such increase in other income was primarily due to the increase in interest income of approximately  net income net income was  in fiscal year  an increase of  or approximately as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in selling price of bromine and crude salt 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  as of december  the components of this increase of  are reflected below 
statement of cash flows years ended december net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities  effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net cash inflow    for the fiscal years  and  we met our working capital and capital investment requirements mainly by using cash flows from operations and cash on hand 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities relating to bromine asset purchases and new bromine resource development 
net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended december   and  we had positive cash flow from operating activities of million  million and million respectively  primarily attributable to net income 
during the year ended december   cash flow from operating activities of million exceeded our net income of million  which is caused by i cash used in working capital of million for the fiscal year  mainly consisted of inventory and tax paid  and ii our net income included substantial non cash charges of million  mainly in form of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment and writ off impairment loss on property  plant and equipment 
during the year ended december   cash flow from operating activities of million exceeded our net income of million  which is caused by i cash used in working capital of million for the fiscal year  mainly consisted of inventory and accounts receivable  and ii our net income included substantial non cash charges of million  mainly in form of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment and loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment 
during the year ended december   cash flow from operating activities of million exceeded our net income of million  which is caused by i cash used in working capital of million for the fiscal year  mainly consisted of inventory and accounts receivable  and ii our net income included substantial non cash charges of million  mainly in form of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment and loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment 
accounts receivable cash collections on our accounts receivable had a major impact on our overall liquidity 
the following table presents the aging analysis of our accounts receivable as of december  and december  december  percent of total percent of total aged days   aged days   aged days  total   the overall accounts receivable balance as of december  increased by  or  as compared to those as of december  such increase is mainly attributable to the extended settlement days by customers due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by prc government to slow down the economy  which in turn lengthened the turnover days of accounts receivable from customers from days for the fiscal year to days for the fiscal year normally  a days credit period is granted to customers with a good repayment history 
we are not aware of any allowances for doubtful debts required for the fiscal year as we have policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history 
we perform ongoing credit evaluation on the financial condition of our customers 
inventory our inventory consists of the following december  december  percent of total percent of total raw materials   finished goods   allowance for obsolete and slowing moving inventory  total   the gross inventory level as of december  increased by  or  as compared to the gross inventory level as of december  raw materials slightly increased by as of december  as compared to december  all of the raw materials are basic chemical industry materials  few of which have a possibility of loss over time  or major fluctuations in their prices 
so  we concluded that all of our raw materials as of december  are fully realizable for production of finished goods without any impairment 
our finished goods are mainly composed of bromine  crude salt and chemical products 
our chemical products are similar to raw materials  as there is no loss over time and a stable market price with a positive gross profit margin of for the fiscal year therefore  we believe that the realization of the chemical products is 
similarly  as there is no depletion of bromine  we believe that the realization of it is also 
although the gross profit margin for the fiscal year decreased to  as compared with in fiscal year  we anticipated that the price in the next six months will not fluctuate significantly to impair the cost of bromine 
the annual loss of crude salt due to evaporation is around 
as the market price of crude salt is stable and the gross margin is high for the fiscal year  we believe that there will be no realizability problem for crude salt and its selling price should not be lower than its cost 
net cash used in investing activities higher capital investments partially offset by compensation received from the prc government for demolition of factory in drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales in drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to the table below detailed the cash capital investments for the fiscal years  and years ended december in million construction of new production lines  acquisition of factories  mineral rights and other assets improvement and upgrade of bromine wells  transmission pipelines and aqueducts  and conversion of syci s production line total cash capital investments in the fiscal year  we carried out improvement and upgrade of bromine wells  transmission pipelines and aqueducts  and conversion of syci s production line  in particular  we used i approximately million cash to reconstruct and renovate a subdivision of factory no 
which included bromine production facilities and brine water channels acquired under a capital lease  ii approximately million cash to carry out enhancement projects to our existing bromine extraction and crude salt production facilities  and iii approximately million cash for the conversion of a chemical production line from wastewater treatment chemical production line to bromopropane 
we also used i approximately million cash for the construction of our new factory no 
due to the taking of leased land by the prc local government for redevelopment  ii approximately million cash for acquisition of factory no 
 and iii approximately million for other new plant and machinery 
these projects were financed by opening cash balances as of december  and cash generated from operations during fiscal year net cash used in provided by financing activities in the fiscal year  we repaid approximately million cash for our capital lease obligation and used another million to repurchase  shares of common stock of the company under the approval of the board of directors 
in the fiscal year  we obtained cash of approximately million from a private placement for settlement of assets acquisition 
in the fiscal year  we raised cash of approximately million from private placements for settlement of note and loan payable  and repayment to related parties 
we believe that our available funds and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs for the next twelve months 
however we will likely need to raise additional capital in order to fund the ongoing program of acquiring unlicensed bromine properties  increasing our chemical production capacity and developing new bromine and crude salt production line in sichuan province  prc 
we expect to raise those funds through credit facilities obtained with lending institutions 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such funding  whether through the issuance of debt or equity  on terms satisfactory to management and our board of directors 
working capital was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was mainly attributable to the cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year we had available cash of approximately million at december   most of which are in highly liquid current deposits with no or little interest rate 
we intend to retain the cash for future expansion of our bromine and crude salt businesses through acquisition  enhancement works to our existing bromine and crude salt business  and exploration cost of new brine water resources in sichuan province  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in the future we intend to focus our efforts on the activities of schc and syci as these segments continue to expand within the chinese market 
we also intend to explore the possibility of cooperation with overseas large scale bromine manufacturers for expansion into overseas markets 
as a result  we may issue additional shares of our capital stock and incur new debt in order to raise cash for acquisitions and other capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
we may not be able to identify  successfully integrate or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire  or any expansion of our business 
an expansion may involve a number of risks  including possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management attention  inability to retain key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated events and the financial statement effect of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of operations 
in addition  if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase  the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially 
we may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable  under managed  or in its early stages of development or growth 
in addition  if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase  the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially 
our inability to implement and manage our expansion strategy successfully may have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
contractual obligations and commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item a of part i of this report  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity
