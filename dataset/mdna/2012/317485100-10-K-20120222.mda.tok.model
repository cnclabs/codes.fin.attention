item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of independent  technology enabled portfolio management  investment advice and retirement income services to participants in employer sponsored defined contribution retirement plans  such as k plans 
we use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of retirement plan participants on a cost efficient basis 
our business model is based on workplace delivery of our services 
we target three key constituencies in the retirement plan market plan participants  plan sponsors and plan providers 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from management fees on assets under management  or aum  as well as from platform fees  by providing portfolio management services  investment advice and retirement income services to plan participants of employer sponsored retirement plans 
we maintain two types of relationships with retirement plan providers 
in direct advisory relationships  we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary 
in subadvisory relationships  the plan provider is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary  and we act in a subadvisory capacity 
professional management we derive professional management revenue from member fees paid by or on behalf of plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service for the management of their account assets 
our professional management service is a discretionary investment management service that includes retirement income services  a retirement plan analyzing investments  contribution rate and projected retirement income  a retirement checkup designed to help plan participants develop a strategy for closing the gap  if any  between the participant s retirement goal and current retirement income forecast and retirement income services 
the services are generally made available to plan participants in a k plan by written agreements with the plan provider  plan sponsor and the plan participant 
the arrangement generally provides for member fees based on the value of assets we manage for plan participants and is generally payable quarterly in arrears 
prior to october   our professional management revenue was generally the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each quarter 
effective october   we changed our method of calculating fees for substantially all members with which we have a direct advisory relationship from quarterly to monthly  thereby calculating fees as the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each month for members 
as a result  the majority of our member fees across both advisory and subadvisory relationships are calculated on a monthly basis 
in 
table of contents general  we expect this methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on our professional management revenue  although this methodology may result in lower member fees if the financial markets are down when member fees are calculated  even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter 
pursuant to the contracts with our members  we calculate our member fees based on the asset amounts in these files as received directly from the plan providers  with no judgments or estimates on our part 
none of our member fees are based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements 
our fees generally are based on aum  which is influenced by market performance 
our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a member s account 
in some cases  our member fees may adjust downward based on overall participant or aum enrollment performance milestones over time 
our member fees are determined by the value of the assets in the member s account at the specified dates and are recognized as the services are performed 
historically  we have seen an increase in professional management revenue in the fourth quarter due to the fee structure with one of our plan providers  under which we recognize the difference between earned revenue and annual minimum contractual revenue in the fourth quarter 
effective january  we no longer expect to see this fourth quarter trend as the fee structure for this particular plan provider has been renegotiated to provide an earned revenue fee structure that eliminates the annual minimum contractual revenue provision 
as a result  the earned revenue from this plan provider could vary substantially with market performance and net enrollment  as is the case with professional management revenue from our other plan providers 
exclusive of these factors  we expect the revised contract will result in comparable economics to the prior arrangement without the exaggerated seasonality 
historically  we have seen a general preference from plan sponsors to commence campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue 
in order to encourage enrollment into our professional management service  we use a variety of promotional techniques  some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized  the timing of revenue recognition or both 
we would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue  which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance 
enrollment metrics we measure enrollment in our professional management service by members as a percentage of eligible plan participants and by aum as a percentage of assets under contract  or auc  in each case across all plans where the professional management service is available for enrollment  including plans where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not commenced 
aum is defined as the amount of retirement plan assets that we manage as part of our professional management service 
our aum is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
our members are the plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
auc is defined as the amount of assets in retirement plans under contract for which the professional management service has been made available to eligible participants 
our auc and eligible participants do not include assets or participants in plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the professional management service available 
eligible participants and assets under contract are reported by plan providers with varying frequency and at different points in time  and is not always updated or marked to market 
if markets have declined since the reporting date  or if assets have left the plan  our auc may be overstated 
if markets have risen since the reporting date  or if assets have been added to the plan  our auc may be understated 
some plan participants may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the plan participant 
certain securities within a plan participant s account may be ineligible for management by us  such as employer 
table of contents stock subject to trading restrictions  and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account 
in both of these circumstances  assets of the relevant participants may be included in auc but cannot be converted to aum 
we believe that auc can be a useful indicator of the additional plan assets available for enrollment efforts that  if successful  would result in these assets becoming aum 
we believe that total eligible participants provides a useful approximation of the number of participants available for enrollment into the professional management service 
in addition to measuring enrollment in all plans where the professional management service is available  we measure enrollment in plans where the professional management service has been available for at least months and in plans where it has been available for at least months 
all plans as of december  members as a percentage of eligible participants aum as a percentage of auc professional management available professional management available months or more professional management available months or more we receive aum data from plan providers at or near the end of each quarter and auc data from plan providers at various points in time  neither of which is marked to market as of quarter end 
in quarters with volatility as significant as the three months ended december  and particularly when the volatility occurs at the end of the quarter  the auc data we receive from plan providers can be significantly different than market values as of quarter end 
therefore  for the three months ended december   we have performed a calculation to estimate the marked to market asset enrollment rate as of december   which we believe was closer to approximately where professional management is available  approximately where professional management has been available for months or more and approximately where professional management has been available for months or more 
as of december   the approximate aggregate style exposure of the portfolios we managed was as follows cash bonds domestic equity international equity total we estimate the aggregate percentage of equity exposures have ranged from a low of approximately to a high of approximately since we began managing assets on a discretionary basis in september these percentages can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio  the demographics of our member population including the adoption of income  the number of members who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk  and  to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management  the proportion of our members for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio 

table of contents changes in aum the following table illustrates changes in our aum from over the last four quarters q q q q in billions aum  beginning of period aum from net enrollment other aum  end of period the aggregate amount of assets under management  at the time of enrollment  of new members who enrolled in our professional management service within the period less the aggregate amount of assets  at the time of cancellation  for voluntary cancellations from the professional management service within the period  less the aggregate amount of assets  as of the last available positive account balance  for involuntary cancellations occurring when the member s k plan account balance has been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the professional management service has become effective within the period 
other factors affecting assets under management include employer and employee contributions  market movement  plan administrative fees as well as participant loans and hardship withdrawals 
we cannot separately quantify the impact of these factors as the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances due to market movement 
contributions are estimated each quarter from annual contribution rates based on data received from plan providers 
contributions are estimated to have been approximately billion in q  billion in q  billion in q and billion in q these amounts are included in the other line item in the above table 
our aum increases or decreases based on several factors 
aum can increase due to market performance  by the addition of new assets as participants enroll into our professional management service  both at existing sponsors as well as at new sponsors where the services have been made available  and by the addition of new assets from employee and employer contributions into their k accounts 
aum can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of members terminating their membership  members rolling their assets out of the retirement plan  and sponsors canceling the professional management service 
historically  member cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance and  in addition  member cancellation rates are typically the highest in the three months immediately following the completion of a given promotional campaign 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  changes in fixed income or equity market performance could significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue 
platform 
we derive platform revenue from recurring  subscription based platform fees for access to either our full suite of services  including professional management  online advice service  and retirement evaluation  or to our online advice service only  and to a lesser extent  from setup fees 
online advice is a nondiscretionary 
table of contents internet based investment advisory service  which includes features such as recommendations among the investment alternatives available in the employer sponsored retirement plan  a summary of the current value of the plan account  a forecast of how much the plan account investments might be worth at retirement  whether a change is recommended to the contribution rate  risk and diversification and or unrestricted employer stock holdings  and a projection of how much the participant may spend at retirement 
plan participants may use the service as frequently as they choose to monitor progress toward their financial goals  receive forecasts and investment recommendations and access educational content at our website 
the arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor  plan provider or the retirement plan itself  depending on the plan structure 
platform revenue is generally paid annually in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity 
setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of sponsor relationships  which is estimated for accounting purposes to be five years 
other revenue 
other revenue includes reimbursement for a portion of marketing and member materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to participants from a limited number of plan sponsors 
the costs associated with these reimbursed print fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue as incurred 
in prior periods  a small portion of other revenue has been derived from a defined benefit consulting business which was discontinued as of december  costs and expenses employee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense and includes wages  cash incentive compensation expense  benefits expenses  employer payroll tax expense and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our cash incentive compensation plan is based  in part  on achieving pre determined annual corporate financial objectives and may result in an increased current period expense while the anticipated revenue benefits associated with the achievement of such corporate financial objectives may be realized in future periods 
we allocate compensation and other related expenses including stock based compensation to our cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative as well as amortization of internal use software expense categories 
while we expect our headcount to increase over time  we believe that the economies of scale in our business model can allow us to grow our compensation and related expenses at a lower rate than revenue 
other costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and plan participant data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for member accounts  marketing materials and postage  and amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support 
we anticipate granting equity awards to board members and certain of our employees each year that may result in significant non cash stock based compensation expense 
the following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data  printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which a portion are reimbursed  printed member materials  and employee related costs for technical operations  implementations  operations  advisor call center operations and portfolio management 
costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties  employee compensation and related expenses  and purchased materials 
costs for connectivity to plan and plan participant data are expected to increase proportionally with our professional management revenue  as well as by contractual increases in plan provider fees as a result of achieving certain milestones 
the expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories  and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue 
consequently  all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our statements of income 
amortization of internal use software  a portion of 
table of contents which relates to our cost of revenue  is not included in cost of revenue but is reflected as a separate line item in our statement of income 
due to a revised agreement with one of our subadvised plan providers  we expect our subadvised printed materials expenses to increase starting in approximately mid research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings  financial research  quality assurance  related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our investment research  product development and engineering personnel and associated expenses and  to a lesser extent  external consulting expenses  which relate primarily to support and maintenance of our existing services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with plan provider and plan sponsor relationship management  plan provider and plan sponsor marketing  direct sales  product marketing  public relations and printing of and postage for marketing materials for direct advisory relationships including amortization of direct response advertising 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and also include commissions  printed materials and general marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes costs for finance  accounting  legal  compliance and administration 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses and fees for consulting and professional services 
we have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of becoming a public company for  among other things  sec reporting and compliance  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  director fees  insurance  and other similar expenses 
amortization of internal use software 
amortization of internal use software expense includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal systems for tracking member data  including aum  member cancellations and other related member statistics 
associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated lives  typically three to five years  of the underlying technology 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses  and fees for external consulting services 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results  as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
direct response advertising 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns  which caused a significant amount of costs to be capitalized for the years ended december   and our advertising costs consist primarily of print materials associated with new member solicitations 
advertising costs that do not qualify as direct response advertising are expensed to sales and marketing at the first time the advertisement takes place 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns on a prospective basis as it was then determined that we had sufficient and verifiable historical patterns over a reasonable period to demonstrate probable future benefits of such campaigns 

table of contents direct response advertising costs are capitalized only if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits 
advertising costs relating to passive enrollment campaigns and other general marketing materials sent to participants do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to sales and marketing in the period the advertising activities first take place 
print fulfillment costs relating to subadvisory campaigns do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to cost of revenue in the period in which the expenses were incurred 
advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns that result in probable future benefits qualify for capitalization as direct response advertising 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the period over which the future benefits are expected to be received 
because of how we earn revenue from our professional management service  demonstrating that the direct response advertising related to our direct advisory active enrollment campaigns results in probable future benefits requires us to make several assumptions about the average period of probable future benefits  the gross revenue we will earn and costs we will incur as a result of each campaign 
we have developed forecasting methodologies that have a degree of reliability sufficient to reasonably estimate the future gross revenue stream associated with a given campaign 
the significant estimates and judgments we use in our forecasting methodologies include average period of probable future benefits  change in aum due to market performance  aum cancellation rates  net contribution rates and estimated enrollment results for campaigns that have not yet been completed 
we have estimated our period of probable future benefits by considering both the historical retention rate of our members while not exceeding the number of years over which we can accurately forecast future net revenues 
the change in aum due to market performance is an estimate of future stock market performance and its estimated relative effect on our aum 
aum cancellation rate is defined as the rate at which assets will cancel out of the professional management program due to voluntary member terminations 
a voluntary member termination is when a member contacts financial engines and terminates his or her membership in the professional management service 
involuntary cancellations such as sponsor and employee terminations or rollovers are captured in the net contribution rate 
net contribution rate is defined as the net amount assets will increase as a result of new contributions in to the k plan less the amount assets will decrease as a result of disbursements from the k plan  as a result of involuntary cancellations 
we have estimated aum cancellation and contribution rates by analyzing their respective historical rates 
we currently have assumed a probable period of future benefits of three years  no change in aum due to market performance and a zero net contribution rate for the purpose of calculating estimated gross revenue 
the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising reported as assets are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool by cost pool basis to the probable remaining future net revenues expected to result directly from such advertising 
at december   million of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active choice enrollment campaigns were reported as assets 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of direct response advertising costs 
advertising expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which direct advisory active enrollment campaign expense was million  million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  impairments to direct response advertising were immaterial 

table of contents the table below evaluates the sensitivity of two of our most significant estimates  namely average period of probable future benefits and assumed change in our aum due to market performance  on the realizability of net capitalized direct response advertising costs as of december  this sensitivity analysis considered all historic and current year campaigns with a net capitalized balance as of december  under our current assumptions of a three year average period of probable future benefits and change in aum due to market performance per year 
the sensitivity table indicates the additional expense charges that would have been recorded as of december  if  effective january   we had assumed different levels of change in aum due to market performance and assumed an estimated period of probable benefits other than years 
direct response advertising sensitivity analysis additional expense impairments to be recognized assumed change in aum due to market performance per year average period of probable future benefits year years years years years any comparable percentage change to aum due to market performance  net contribution rate and aum cancellation rate would have the same relative impact on the sensitivity analysis as they all directly impact member aum 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
prior to september   we maintained a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  since the likelihood of the realization of those assets had not become more likely than not 
we continually evaluate additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the 
table of contents deferred tax assets  including scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance 
effective september   we believed that sufficient positive evidence existed from historical operations and future income projections to conclude that it was more likely than not to fully realize our federal deferred tax assets and to partially realize our state of california deferred tax assets 
therefore  we released valuation allowances of million during the year ended december  we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million relating to the state of california as it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize these assets prior to their expiration 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through as of december   approximately million of the net operating losses will benefit additional paid in capital when realized 
as of december   we also had research credit carryforwards for federal and state of california income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income taxes  which are based on estimates of future realizability 
the federal research credit carryforwards expire through the state of california research credit carries forward indefinitely 
all tax years since inception are open and may be subject to examination in one or more jurisdictions 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation for stock option awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of stock based option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends over the expected term of the awards 
year ended december  expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield we use the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of stock options as we expect our employee exercise behavior to change resulting from our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group based on industry and market capitalization data 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  future stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share

professional management revenue and platform revenue comprised and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  professional management revenue professional management revenue increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the average aum used to calculate fees from approximately billion for the year ended december  to approximately billion for the year ended december  this increase in aum was driven primarily by increased net enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing member acquisitions  as well as market appreciation and contributions 
effective october   we changed our method of calculating fees for substantially all members with which we have a direct advisory relationship from quarterly to monthly  thereby calculating fees as the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each month for members 
effective january  due to a revised agreement with one of our subadvised plan providers  an annual minimum contractual revenue provision has been eliminated which historically resulted in an increase in professional management revenue in the fourth quarter 
as a result  the earned revenue from this plan provider could vary substantially with market performance and net enrollment  as is the case with professional management revenue from 
table of contents our other plan providers 
exclusive of these factors  we expect the revised contract will result in comparable economics to the prior arrangement without the exaggerated seasonality in the fourth quarter 
platform revenue platform revenue increased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased platform fee revenue resulting from service availability at new sponsors 
costs and expenses costs and expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million increase in cost of revenue  exclusive of amortization of internal use software  a million increase in research and development expense  a million increase in sales and marketing expense  a million increase in general and administrative expense and a million increase in amortization of internal use software for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  across functional areas  wages  benefits and payroll taxes increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to headcount growth and annual compensation increases effective april  cash incentive compensation expenses decreased due to achieving higher incentive thresholds for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was offset by increased headcount and compensation increases 
stock based compensation expense decreased due to the effect of our graded vesting attribution method which resulted in declining expenses in later periods for stock options granted in the years ended december  and we expect wages  benefits and payroll taxes to continue to increase for the year ended december  due to planned headcount growth and annual compensation increases 
we granted equity awards with an aggregate value of million to certain of our existing employees in mid november and we will recognize compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method over a four year vesting period  which will result in a greater amount of compensation costs recognized in earlier periods of the grants with declining amounts recognized in later periods 
we estimate these equity grants will incur approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for the year ended december   which is in addition to the amortization of both previously and subsequently granted stock options  including options expected to be granted in  under the accelerated expense method 
we plan to continue to grant equity awards during the fiscal year to board members  certain of our existing employees and new employees 
in order to accommodate the growth of our employee base  we entered into a lease contract in october for a new headquarters facilities space in sunnyvale  california with an estimated relocation date in mid the lease term is for eight years and expires in may  with an option to extend the lease term for years at fair market rent 
we estimate that this new lease will incur facilities related expense of approximately million and depreciation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  our current headquarters facility lease terminates in august cost of revenue cost of revenue  exclusive of amortization of internal use software  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data resulting from an increase in professional management revenue  as well as contractual increases in plan provider fees as a result of achieving certain aum milestones for the year ended 
table of contents december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  wages  benefits and payroll taxes  and related overhead expenses for the year ended december  increased million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in cash incentive and stock based compensation expenses of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  there was also an increase in printed marketing materials for subadvisory relationships and printed member materials of million  as well as an increase in equipment expenses of million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data and an increase in subadvisory campaign printed materials costs of which a portion is reimbursed by the applicable plan provider and classified as other revenue 
given significant growth in aum in recent years  as well as aum projections for  which include certain assumptions for market and enrollment performance  we expect a few plan providers will achieve aum based milestones in these aum milestone achievements are expected to result in an increase in our fees paid to those plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data 
we expect these increases  combined with a revised agreement with one of our subadvised plan providers in which we will be incurring a greater portion of the printed materials costs  and the increase in stock based compensation expense as described above  will likely modestly increase cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  for the year ended december  research and development research and development expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  there was a million increase in wages  benefits and payroll taxes  and related overhead expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  offset by a decrease in stock based compensation and cash incentive expense of million and for the year ended december   respectively 
in addition  there was a decrease in the capitalization of internal use software of million and an increase in recruiting and equipment expenses totaling million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a slower increase in employee related expenses relative to the increase in revenue during the same period 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  there was a million increase in advisory printed enrollment materials expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  additionally  there was a million increase in wages  benefits and payroll taxes  and related overhead expenses for the year ended december   as well as a million increase in amortized commission expense  offset by a decrease in cash incentive and stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
there also was a million increase in marketing expenses  including creative development and other general marketing efforts  as well as an increase in consulting  facilities and travel expenses of million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to slower increase in employee related expenses relative to the increase in revenue during the same period 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to 
table of contents an increase in costs related to supporting operations as a public company  including audit  legal and insurance expenses of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  wages  and benefits and payroll taxes expense for the year ended december  was million higher than for the year ended december   offset by a decrease in stock based compensation and cash incentive expense of million and million  respectively  as well as a decrease in related overhead expenses of million due to general and administrative headcount growing at a slower rate than other functional areas

prior to september   a full valuation allowance was maintained for our net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of the realization of those assets had not become more likely than not 
in the third quarter of  we concluded that sufficient positive evidence existed from historical operations and future projections that it was more likely than not to fully realize the federal deferred tax assets and to partially realize the state of california deferred tax assets  and therefore released all of the federal valuation allowances and a portion of the state of california valuation allowances 
we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million as of december  relating to net operating losses for the state of california as it is not more likely than not to realize these assets prior to their expiration

the quarterly results of operations include all necessary adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year and are not necessarily indicative of future results 

table of contents our professional management revenue generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented as a result of aum growth driven primarily by net new enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing member acquisitions  market appreciation and contributions 
professional management revenue decreased in the first quarter of compared to the prior quarter  due primarily to the fee structure with one of our plan providers under which we recognize the difference between earned revenue and minimum contractual revenue in the fourth quarter 
effective january  we no longer expect to see this fourth quarter trend as the fee structure for this particular plan provider has been renegotiated to provide an earned revenue fee structure that eliminates the annual minimum contractual revenue provision 
platform revenue has generally increased quarter over quarter as a result of new business 
total costs and expenses have fluctuated both in absolute dollars and percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter due primarily to employee related expenses related to headcount growth and compensation increases  including wages  cash incentive compensation  stock based compensation and benefits  fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data and professional services expenses to our support operations as a public company  offset by increased net capitalization of direct response advertising

non gaap adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share adjusted ebitda represents net income before net interest expense income  income tax expense benefit  depreciation  amortization of internal use software  amortization of direct response advertising  amortization of deferred sales commissions and amortization of stock based compensation 
adjusted net income represents net income before stock based compensation expense  net of tax and certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances 
adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding 
for all periods prior to fiscal year  the dilutive common share equivalents outstanding also include on a non weighted basis the conversion of all preferred stock to common stock  the shares associated with the stock dividend and the shares sold in the initial public offering 
this differs from the weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for purposes of calculating gaap earnings per share 

table of contents our management uses adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance  for planning purposes including the preparation of annual budgets  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda  among other factors  was used for the year ended december  and will be used for the year ended december  when determining cash incentive compensation for employees  including management 
we also present adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that these measures provide our board of directors  management and investors with additional information to measure our performance 
adjusted ebitda provides comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization of internal use software  direct response advertising and commissions  and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital structure decisions and capital market conditions 
management also believes it is useful to exclude stock based compensation expense from adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time  as well as certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances  do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time 
adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that  although adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share have limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
in particular you should consider adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect the non cash component of employee compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized generally will have to be replaced in the future by payment of cash  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
given the limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share  these financial measures should be considered in conjunction with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap and the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income 
further  management also reviews gaap measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in adjusted ebitda  such as our level of capital expenditures  equity issuance and interest expense  among other measures

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board on fair value measurement 
the guidance clarifies how a principal market is determined  addresses the fair value measurement of instruments with offsetting market or counterparty credit risks  addresses the concept of valuation premise and highest and best use  extends the prohibition on blockage factors to all three levels of the fair value hierarchy and requires additional disclosures 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
this pronouncement primarily impacts disclosures 
we do not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  this pronouncement impacts disclosures only 
we do not expect this to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as an investment manager for investor accounts for which we provide portfolio management services 
for the year ended december   of our revenue was derived from fees based on the market value of aum 
we expect this percentage to increase over time 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  any changes in fixed income or equity market performance would significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue
