for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information  you should read the notes to the financial statements included in this report 
overview crosstex energy  inc is a delaware corporation formed on april  to engage in the gathering  transmission  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls through its subsidiaries 
on july   we formed crosstex energy  lp  a delaware limited partnership  to acquire indirectly substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of its predecessor  crosstex energy services  ltd 
our assets consist almost exclusively of partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp  a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering  transmission  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls 
these partnership interests consist of i  common units  representing approximately of the limited partner interests in crosstex energy  lp as of december  and ii ownership interest in crosstex energy gp  llc  the general partner of crosstex energy  lp  which owns a general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in crosstex energy  lp our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
the partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at the end of each quarter  less reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business or to provide for future distributions 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
during  the partnership paid quarterly distributions to it common unitsholders in may  august  and november of   and related to the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively 
the partnership paid a quarterly distribution of in february related to the fourth quarter of our share of the distributions with respect to our limited and general partner interests in the partnership totaled million for the year end december  
table of contents since we control the general partner interest in the partnership  we reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with the partnership s financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries 
the interest owned by non controlling partners share of income is reflected separately in our results of operations 
we have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership  and our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
our consolidated results of operations are derived from the results of operations of the partnership and also include our gains on the issuance of units in the partnership  deferred taxes  interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income  interest income expense and general and administrative expenses not reflected in the partnership s results of operation 
accordingly  the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the partnership 
the partnership s primary focus is on the gathering  processing  transmission and marketing of ngls which it manages in regional reporting segments of midstream activity 
the partnership s geographic focus is in the north texas barnett shale ntx and in louisiana which has two reportable business segments the lig system and the south louisiana processing and ngl assets  or pngl 
the partnership manages its operations by focusing on gross operating margin because its business is generally to purchase and resell natural gas for a margin  or to gather  process  transport or market natural gas and ngls for a fee 
we define gross operating margin as operating revenue minus cost of purchased gas and ngls 
the partnership s gross operating margins are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems  processed at its processing facilities  and the volumes of ngls handled at its fractionation facilities 
the partnership generates revenues from four primary sources purchasing and reselling or transporting natural gas on the pipeline systems it owns  processing natural gas at its processing plants  fractionating and marketing the recovered ngls  and providing compression services 
the partnership generally gathers or transports gas owned by others through its facilities for a fee  or it buys natural gas from a producer  plant or shipper at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index  then transports and resells the natural gas at the market index 
the partnership attempts to execute all purchases and sales substantially concurrently  or it enters into a future delivery obligation  thereby establishing the basis for the margin it will receive for each natural gas transaction 
the partnership s gathering and transportation margins related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas 
the partnership is also party to certain long term gas sales commitments that it satisfies through supplies purchased under long term gas purchase agreements 
when the partnership enters into those arrangements  its sales obligations generally match its purchase obligations 
however  over time the supplies that it has under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes and the partnership may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by buying additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments 
in the partnership s purchase sale transactions  the resale price is generally based on the same index at which the gas was purchased 
however  on occasion the partnership has entered into certain purchase sale transactions in which the purchase price is based on a production area index and the sales price is based on a market area index  and it captures the difference in the indices also referred to as basis spread  less the transportation expenses from the two areas  as margin 
changes in the basis spread can increase or decrease the margins 

table of contents one contract the delivery contract has a term to that obligates the partnership to supply approximately  mmbtu d of gas 
at the time that the partnership entered into the delivery contract in it had dedicated supply sources in the barnett shale that exceeded the delivery obligations under the delivery contract 
the partnership s agreements with these suppliers generally provided that the purchase price for the gas was equal to a portion of its sales price for such gas less certain fees and costs 
accordingly  the partnership was initially able to generate a positive margin under the delivery contract 
however  since entering into the delivery contract  there has been both a reduction in the gas available under the supply contracts and the discovery of other shale reserves  most notably the haynesville and the marcellus shales  which has increased the supplies available to east coast markets and reduced the basis spread between north texas area production and the market indices used in the delivery contract 
due to these factors  the partnership has had to purchase a portion of the gas to fulfill its obligations under the delivery contract at market prices  resulting in negative margins under the delivery contract 
the partnership has recorded a loss of approximately million during the year ended december  on the delivery contract 
the partnership expects that it will record a loss of approximately million to million on the delivery contract for the year ending december  this estimate is based on forward prices  basis spreads and other market assumptions as of year end these assumptions are subject to change if market conditions change during  and actual results under the delivery contract in could be substantially different from year end estimates  which may result in a greater loss than currently estimated 
the partnership also realizes gross operating margins from its processing services primarily through three different contract arrangements processing margins margin  percentage of liquids pol or fixed fee based 
under margin contract arrangements the partnership s margins are higher during periods of high liquid prices relative to natural gas prices 
gross operating margin results under pol contracts are impacted only by the value of the liquids produced with margins higher during periods of relatively high liquids prices 
under fixed fee based contracts the partnership s margins are driven by throughput volume 
see commodity price risk 
operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset 
among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision  property insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  measurement and utilities 
these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges  and therefore do not normally decrease or increase significantly in the short term with decreases or increases in the volume of gas moved through the asset 
business strategy the partnership s business strategy consists of three overarching objectives which are to maximize earnings and growth of its existing businesses  to enhance the scale and diversification of its assets and to continue its focus on operational excellence 
the partnership believes it was successful in executing its business strategy during  and it will continue to pursue these objectives in maximize earnings and growth of existing businesses 
the partnership intends to leverage its franchise position  infrastructure and customer relationships by expanding existing systems to meet new or increased demand for its gathering  transmission  processing and marketing services 
enhance scale and diversification of our assets 
the partnership looks to grow and diversify by acquiring and or building assets in new areas to serve as a platform for growth with a focus on areas with emerging shale plays and by expanding its ngl and crude oil infrastructure to provide services in new regions 

table of contents continue to focus on operational excellence 
the partnership continues to operate its existing asset base to maximize cost efficiencies  provide flexibility for its customers and provide reliable capacity for its customers 
the partnership will continue to focus on safety  environmental integrity  innovation and customer service 
impact of federal income taxes we are a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as such  we are subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law and are also subject to state income tax 
while we have historically been allocated losses from our investment in the partnership s units  we expect that in the future we will be allocated taxable income as the level of tax depreciation and amortization deductions allocated to us from the partnership diminishes relative to the income allocated to us from the partnership s operations 
as of december  we have a net operating loss carry forward of million for federal tax purposes 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations to utilize these net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
once these net operating loss carry forwards are fully utilized  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law 
our use of this net operating loss carry forward will be limited if there is an ownership change in our common stock generally  cumulative stock ownership changes in our common stock exceeding during a three year period  as determined under section of the internal revenue code 
commodity price risk the partnership s business is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
its exposure to these risks is primarily in the gas processing component of its business 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s processed gas arrangements  based on gross operating margin  was processed under percent of liquids pol contracts 
a significant volume of inlet gas at the partnership s south louisiana and north texas processing plants is settled under pol agreements 
under these contracts the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered and the producer bears all the costs of the natural gas volumes lost shrink 
accordingly  the partnership s revenues under these contracts are directly impacted by the market price of ngls 
the partnership also realizes processing gross margins under processing margin margin contracts and spot purchases 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s processed gas arrangements  based on gross operating margin  was processed under margin contracts and spot purchases 
the partnership has a number of margin contracts on the plaquemine  gibson  eunice  bluewater  and pelican processing plants 
under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas shrink and the cost of fuel used in processing 
the shrink and fuel losses are referred to as plant thermal reduction or ptr 
the partnership s margins from these contracts can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
the partnership is also indirectly exposed to commodity prices due to the negative impacts on production and the development of production of natural gas and ngls connected to or near the assets and on its margins for transportation between certain market centers 
low prices for these products will reduce the demand for the partnership s services and volumes on its systems 

table of contents in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile and the partnership expects this volatility to continue 
for example  prices of natural gas in were below the market price realized throughout most of while prices for oil and ngls were higher than market prices 
crude oil prices based on the new york mercantile exchange the nymex futures daily close prices for the prompt month in ranged from a low of per bbl in october to a high of per bbl in april weighted average ngl prices in based on the oil price information service opis napoleonville daily average spot liquids prices ranged from a low of per gallon in february to a high of per gallon in may natural gas prices based on gas daily henry hub closing prices during ranged from a high of per mmbtu in june to a low of per mmbtu in november changes in commodity prices may also indirectly impact the partnership s profitability by influencing drilling activity and well operations  and thus the volume of gas the partnership gathers and processes 
the volatility in commodity prices may cause the partnership s gross operating margin and cash flows to vary widely from period to period 
partnership hedging strategies may not be sufficient to offset price volatility risk and  in any event  do not cover all of the partnership s throughput volumes

accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and commodity risk management 
the partnership recognizes revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or ngls are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
it generally accrues one month of sales and the related gas purchases and reverses these accruals when the sales and purchases are actually invoiced and recorded in the subsequent months 
actual results could differ from the accrual estimates 
the partnership utilizes extensive estimation procedures to determine the sales and cost of gas purchase accruals for each accounting cycle 
accruals are based on estimates of volumes flowing each month from a variety of sources 
the partnership uses actual measurement data  if it is available  and will use such data as producer shipper nominations  prior month average daily flows  estimated flow for new production and estimated end user requirements all adjusted for the estimated impact of weather patterns when actual measurement data is not available 
throughout the month or two following production  actual measured sales and transportation volumes are received and invoiced and used in a process referred to as actualization 
through the actualization process  any estimation differences recorded through the accrual are reflected in the subsequent month s accounting cycle when the accrual is reversed and actual amounts are recorded 
actual volumes purchased  processed or sold may differ from the estimates due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to actual wellhead production or customer requirements being higher or lower than the amount nominated at the beginning of the month  liquids recoveries being higher or lower than estimated because gas processed through the plants was richer or leaner than estimated  the estimated impact of weather patterns being different from the actual impact on sales and purchases  and pipeline maintenance or allocation causing actual deliveries of gas to be different than estimated 
the partnership believes that its accrual process for sales and purchases provides a reasonable estimate of such sales and purchases 

table of contents the partnership engages in price risk management activities in order to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and ngls 
it also manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas and ngl prices 
the partnership uses derivatives to hedge against changes in cash flows related to product prices  as opposed to their use for trading purposes 
fasb asc requires that all derivatives and hedging instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the partnership conducts off system gas marketing operations as a service to producers on systems that it does not own 
it refers to these activities as part of energy trading activities 
in some cases  the partnership earns an agency fee from the producer for arranging the marketing of the producer s natural gas 
in other cases  the partnership purchases the natural gas from the producer and enters into a sales contract with another party to sell the natural gas 
the revenue and cost of sales for these activities are included in revenue on a net basis in the statement of operations 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for energy trading activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance future commitments and significantly reduce risk related to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counter party risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
our energy trading contracts qualify as derivatives  and it uses mark to market accounting for both physical and financial contracts of the energy trading business 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to energy trading activities are recognized in earnings as gain or loss on derivatives immediately 
sales of securities by subsidiaries 
prior to  we recognized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations resulting from subsidiary sales of additional equity interest  including the partnership s limited partnership units to unrelated parties 
pursuant to new accounting guidance adopted effective january   we reflect changes in our ownership interest in the partnership as equity transactions 
the carrying amount of the non controlling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in our ownership interest in the partnership 
any difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the amount by which the non controlling interest is adjusted is recognized in additional paid in capital 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with fasb asc  the partnership evaluates the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
when determining whether impairment of one of the partnership s long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the purchase and resale margins on natural gas  volume of gas available to the asset  markets available to the asset  operating expenses  and future natural gas prices and ngl product prices 
the amount of availability of gas to an asset is sometimes based on assumptions regarding future drilling activity  which may be dependent in part on natural gas prices 

table of contents projections of gas volumes and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  the partnership s ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers  producers  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect the partnership s cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
depreciation expense and cost capitalization 
the partnership s assets consist primarily of natural gas gathering pipelines  processing plants  and transmission pipelines 
the partnership capitalizes all construction related direct labor and material costs  as well as indirect construction costs 
indirect construction costs include general engineering and the costs of funds used in construction 
capitalized interest represents the cost of funds used to finance the construction of new facilities and is expensed over the life of the constructed assets through the recording of depreciation expense 
the partnership capitalizes the costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life  while it expenses the costs of repairs  replacements and maintenance projects as incurred 
the partnership generally computes depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
certain assets such as land  ngl line pack and natural gas line pack are non depreciable 
the computation of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage value of assets 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates may be reviewed to determine if any changes are needed 
such changes could involve an increase or decrease in estimated useful lives or salvage values  which would impact future depreciation expense 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow presented in the liquidity discussions below includes cash flow from discontinued operations for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income before non cash income and expenses and changes in working capital for  and were as follows in millions years ended december  income before non cash income and expenses changes in working capital the primary reason for the increase in cash flow from income before non cash income and expenses of million from to relates to payments made in for settlement of interest rate swaps  make whole payments and pik notes combined with an increase in gross operating margin and a decrease in interest expense 
the primary reason for the decreased cash flow from income before non cash income and expenses of million from to relates to payment for settlement of interest rate swaps  make whole payments and pik notes in

we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  changes in working capital may fluctuate significantly between periods even though the partnership s trade receivables and payables are typically collected and paid in to day pay cycles 
a large volume of its revenues are collected and a large volume of its gas purchases are paid near each month end or the first few days of the following month so receivable and payable balances at any month end may fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of these receipts and payments 
in addition  although the partnership strives to minimize natural gas and ngls in inventory  these working inventory balances may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to operational reasons and due to changes in natural gas and ngl prices 
the changes in working capital during the years ended december  and are due to the impact of the fluctuations discussed above

potential changes in use of sabine plant during currently  its sabine plant has a contract with a third party to fractionate the raw make ngls produced by the plant 
the partnership has been unsuccessful in renewing this contract  which expires on march  the partnership has an interim solution to continue to provide for fractionation of the ngls produced by the sabine plant 
ultimately  the partnership plans to connect the sabine gas supply to its eunice plant  which can process the gas 
table of contents and fractionate the produced ngls 
if this processing change is made  the partnership will likely cease operating the sabine plant 
although the partnership does not have specific plans at this time to relocate the sabine plant once it is idled  the partnership may consider it for utilization elsewhere in its operations 
the net book value of the sabine plant was million as of december  if the plant is idled on a long term basis as contemplated above  an impairment may be recorded to expense the non recoverable costs associated with the plant s current location  which are estimated to be less than million based on the net book value as of december  capital projects for the partnership s capital budget includes approximately million of identified growth projects and capital interest

credit risk risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the partnership s customers are a major concern in its business 
the partnership is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers and other counterparties  such as lenders and hedging counterparties 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect the results of operations and reduce the partnership s ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years in the economy as a whole 
the midstream natural gas industry experienced an increase in labor and material costs during  but and remained relatively unchanged 
these increases did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees

contingencies on june   formosa plastics corporation  texas  formosa plastics corporation america  formosa utility venture  ltd  and nan ya plastics corporation  america filed a lawsuit against crosstex energy  inc  crosstex energy  lp  crosstex energy gp  lp  crosstex energy gp  llc  crosstex energy services  lp  and crosstex gulf coast marketing  ltd 
in the th judicial district court of calhoun county  texas  asserting claims for negligence  res ipsa loquitor  products liability and strict liability relating to the alleged receipt by the plaintiffs of natural gas liquids into their facilities from facilities operated by the partnership 
the amended petition alleges that the plaintiffs have incurred approximately million in damages  including damage to equipment and lost profits 
the partnership has submitted the claim to its insurance carriers and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
the partnership believes that any recovery would be within applicable policy limits 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter  the partnership does not expect that an award in this matter will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
at times  the partnership s gas utility subsidiaries acquire pipeline easements and other property rights by exercising rights of eminent domain provided under state law 
as a result  the partnership or its subsidiaries is a party to a number of lawsuits under which a court will determine the value of pipeline easements or other property interests obtained by the partnership s gas utility subsidiaries by condemnation 
damage awards in these suits should reflect the value of the property interest acquired and the diminution in the value of the remaining property owned by the landowner 
however  some landowners have alleged unique damage theories to inflate their damage claims or assert valuation methodologies that could result in damage awards in excess of the amounts anticipated 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters  the partnership does not expect that awards in these matters will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the partnership or its subsidiaries is defending a number of lawsuits filed by owners of property located near processing facilities or compression facilities constructed by the partnership as part of its systems

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the partnership s primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
in addition  it is also exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on floating rate debt 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act into law  a part of which relates to increased regulation of the markets for derivative products of the type the partnership uses to manage areas of market risk 
while the commodity futures trading commission has not yet completed its expected series of new regulations to implement the act  dodd frank may result in increased costs to the partnership to implement our market risk management strategy 
commodity price risk the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
its exposure to these risks is primarily in the gas processing component of its business 
the partnership currently processes gas under three main types of contractual arrangements processing margin contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink and the cost of fuel used in processing 
the shrink and fuel losses are referred to as plant thermal reduction or ptr 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
however  the partnership mitigates its risk of processing natural gas when margins are negative primarily through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable for the partnership  or by contracts that revert to a minimum fee for processing if the natural gas must be processed to meet pipeline quality specifications 
percent of liquids contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of liquids contracts  but do decline during periods of low ngl prices 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure and are paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is processed 

table of contents the gross operating margin presentation in the table below is calculated net of results from discontinued operations 
gas processing margins by contract types and gathering and transportation margins as a percent of total gross operating margin for the comparative year to date periods are as follows years ended december  gathering and transportation margin gas processing margins processing margin percent of liquids fee based total gas processing total the partnership has hedges in place at december  covering a portion of the liquids volumes it expects to receive under percent of liquids pol contracts 
the hedges done via swaps are set forth in the following table 
the relevant payment index price is the monthly average of the daily closing price for deliveries of commodities into mont belvieu  texas as reported by the oil price information service opis 
period underlying notional volume we pay we receive fair value asset liability in thousands january december ethane mbbls index gal january december propane mbbls index gal january december normal butane mbbls index gal january december natural gasoline mbbls index gal weighted average the partnership has hedged its exposure to declines in prices for ngl volumes produced for its account 
the ngl volumes hedged  as set forth above  focus on pol contracts 
the partnership hedges its pol exposure based on volumes it considers hedgeable volumes committed under contracts that are long term in nature versus total pol volumes that include volumes that may fluctuate due to contractual terms  such as contracts with month to month processing options 
the partnership has hedged of its hedgeable volumes at risk through december of total volumes at risk through december 
the partnership also has hedges in place at december  covering the fractionation spread risk related to its processing margin contracts as set forth in the following table period underlying notional volume we pay we receive fair value asset liability in thousands january december ethane mbbls index gal january december propane mbbls index gal january december normal butane mbbls index gal january december natural gasoline mbbls index gal january december natural gas  mmbtu d mmbtu index  weighted average 
table of contents in relation to its fractionation spread risk  as set forth above  the partnership has hedged of its hedgeable liquids volumes at risk through december of total liquids volumes at risk and of the related hedgeable ptr volumes through december of total ptr volumes 
the partnership is also subject to price risk to a lesser extent for fluctuations in natural gas prices with respect to a portion of its gathering and transport services 
approximately of the natural gas the partnership markets is purchased at a percentage of the relevant natural gas index price  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the natural gas at a percentage of the index price  the partnership s resale margins are higher during periods of high natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of natural gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of natural gas bought or sold under either basis  which leaves the partnership with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and ngls using over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
as of december   outstanding natural gas swap agreements  ngl swap agreements  swing swap agreements  storage swap agreements and other derivative instruments were a net fair value liability of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical increase in gas and ngl prices would result in an increase of approximately million in the net fair value liability of these contracts as of december  to a net fair value liability of approximately million 
interest rate risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate bank credit facility 
at december   the partnership had million outstanding borrowings under this facility 
a increase or decrease in interest rates would change our annual interest expense by approximately million for the year 
at december  and  the partnership had total fixed rate debt obligations of million and million  respectively 
the balances at december  and are substantially related to the partnership s senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 
the fair value of these fixed rate obligations was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt the senior unsecured notes by million based on the debt obligations as of december
