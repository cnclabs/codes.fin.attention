overview the howard hughes corporation s mission is to be the preeminent developer and operator of master planned communities and mixed use properties 
we create timeless places and memorable experiences that inspire people while driving sustainable  long term growth and value for our shareholders 
we specialize in the development of master planned communities  the redevelopment or repositioning of real estate assets currently generating revenues  also called operating assets  and other strategic real estate opportunities in the form of entitled and unentitled land and other development rights 
our assets are located across the united states 
we expect to drive income and growth through entitlements  land and home site sales and project developments 
we are focused on maximizing value from our assets  and we continue to develop and refine business plans to achieve that goal 
we operate our business in three segments master planned communities mpc s  operating assets and strategic developments 
unlike real estate companies that are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as real estate investment trusts  we have no restrictions on our operating activities or types of services that we can offer  which we believe provides us with flexibility for maximizing the value of our real estate portfolio 
master planned community development has a significant impact to our business 
the cash flows and earnings from the business can be much more variable than from our operating assets because the mpc business generates revenues from land sales rather than recurring contractual revenues from operating leases 
we believe many of our assets require re positioning to maximize their value 
in addition  we are pursuing development opportunities for a number of our assets that were previously postponed due to lack of liquidity resulting from deteriorating economic conditions  the credit market collapse and the bankruptcy filing of our predecessors 
we are also developing plans for other assets for which no formal plans had been previously developed 
the development and re development process for each specific asset can be complex and take from several months to several years prior to the commencement of actual construction 
each local market must be studied  the highest and best use of the land and improvements determined  entitlements and permits obtained  architectural designs made  construction drawings and plans completed  tenant commitments secured  and sources of capital committed 
during this period  these activities generally have very little impact on our financial statements relative to the activity and effort involved in the pre development process 
during  we assessed our assets to identify the best repositioning opportunities  conducted pre development activities for many of those opportunities and  in certain cases  partnered with local developers to conduct 
table of contents development activities for the related asset 
we are also in the process of creating development plans for several of our assets  determining how to finance their re development or completion and how to maximize their long term value potential 
in addition  we implemented leasing strategies that preserve the flexibility to re develop operating assets that currently generate cash flows and are re development candidates  such as ward centers  the south street seaport and riverwalk marketplace 
to preserve flexibility  we frequently do not sign long term leases or we otherwise require provisions allowing us to terminate the leases prior to their expiration 
these restrictions are typically unattractive to retailers and may negatively impact our rental revenues during this period 
significant operating and development milestones achieved during include the following we generated a million increase in mpc land sales revenue for  a increase compared to on a same store basis assuming the woodlands was consolidated by us during both periods  we acquired our former partner s economic interest in the woodlands 
the transaction enabled us to internalize and leverage the woodlands well regarded master planned community development team  access attractive commercial development activities in the woodlands town center and control of unsold residential and commercial land and cash flowing commercial real estate assets  we accelerated lot sales and realized price increases at bridgeland 
lot sales and average price per lot for increased by to lots and to  per lot  respectively  compared with  we closed on new or renewal leases totaling  square feet of space  excluding leases with terms of one year or less  for certain of our retail operating properties  while maintaining the flexibility to redevelop these properties  we completed leasing of waterway square  a  square foot office building in the woodlands 
average net rent per square foot is  we pre leased over of waterway square  a  square foot office building that will be constructed in at average net rents per square foot of and at a total cost to build estimated to be million exclusive of land value and pre existing garage allocation  we completed a stall parking garage at ward centers and delivered a  square foot adjacent retail shell to a new tenant  we entered into a letter of intent with the economic development corporation of the city of new york to modify the ground lease to permit the redevelopment of pier and the option to pursue a mixed use development of the uplands area of south street seaport  we partnered with a local development team to explore the construction of an approximately unit condominium tower above the nordstrom parking garage at ala moana center in honolulu  hi 
we equally own the venture with our partner 
the venture values our condominium rights at million  which is a premium to our million book value at december   we entered into a joint venture with a local developer to construct an approximate unit class a apartment building with  square feet of retail space on a acre site we own at the columbia town center 
this site is named columbia parcel d 
we equally own the venture with our partner 
the venture values our land at approximately million  which is a premium to our aggregate million book value at december   we formed a joint venture and entered into a development agreement with the owner of land adjacent to our bridges at mint hill site to explore development of a shopping center on our combined properties 
the project is entitled for million square feet of retail development  and we closed on an aggregate million of non recourse mortgage financings generating approximately million of liquidity and future borrowing capacity 
this amount includes a million financing for ward centers which repaid three separate securitized mortgages totaling 
table of contents approximately million 
this new five year financing will provide flexibility to redevelop ward centers in phases and also created million of excess proceeds capacity that can be drawn down and reinvested into the property  subject to cash flow coverage tests 
we obtained a million first mortgage loan which refinanced approximately million of mortgage debt and is secured by the waterway square and new trails office buildings 
the excess proceeds were used to repay credit facility debt and for working capital 
we also refinanced million of mortgage debt secured by the n 
wacker office building with a million mortgage maturing in results of operations our revenues primarily are derived from the sale of individual lots at our master planned communities to home builders and from tenants at our operating assets in the form of fixed minimum rents  overage rent and recoveries of operating expenses 
the woodlands operating results for historical periods when this investment was a real estate affiliate are now presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of this management discussion and analysis and segment reporting  in order to provide comparability between periods for analyzing operating results 
we continue to reconcile the segment presentation to reported ebt as defined below 
our other real estate affiliates  including equity investments owned by the woodlands  primarily represent entities that are accounted for using the equity or cost method as appropriate 
we use a number of operating measures for assessing operating performance of our communities  assets  properties and projects within our segments  some of which may not be common among all three of our segments 
we believe that investors may find some operating measures more useful than others when separately evaluating each segment 
one common operating measure used to assess operating results for our business segments is real estate property earnings before taxes ebt 
management believes that ebt provides useful information about our operating performance 
we define ebt as net income loss from continuing operations excluding general and administrative expenses  corporate interest income and depreciation expense  investment in real estate basis adjustment  benefit from income taxes  warrant liability gain loss  reorganization items and the effects of the previously mentioned items within our equity in earnings loss from real estate affiliates 
we present ebt because we use this measure  among others  internally to assess the core operating performance of our assets 
we also present this measure because we believe certain investors use it as a measure of a company s historical operating performance 
we believe that the inclusion of certain adjustments to net income loss from continuing operations to calculate ebt is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because ebt therefore excludes certain non recurring and non cash items  including reorganization items related to the bankruptcy  which we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance 
ebt should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income loss attributable to common stockholders or gaap net income loss from continuing operations  as it has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of the limitations of this metric are that it does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  does not reflect income taxes that we may be required to pay  does not reflect any cash requirements for replacement of depreciated or amortized assets or that these assets have different useful lives  and does not reflect limitations on  or costs related to  transferring earnings from our real estate affiliates to us 

table of contents see note of our audited financial statements for additional information about our segments and a reconciliation of ebt to net income loss attributable to common stockholders 
operating assets net operating income we believe that net operating income noi is a useful supplemental measure of the performance of our operating assets 
we define noi as property specific revenues rental income  tenant recoveries and other income less expenses real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  marketing and other property expenses and excluding the operations of properties held for disposition 
noi also excludes straight line rents  market lease amortization  impairments  depreciation  ground rent and other amortization expense 
because noi excludes general and administrative expenses  interest expense  impairments  depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from property dispositions  allocations to non controlling interests  reorganization items  strategic initiatives  provision for income taxes  discontinued operations and extraordinary items  the company believes that it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  and operating costs 
the company uses noi to evaluate its operating performance on a property by property basis because noi allows the company to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure  lease rates and tenant base  which vary by property  have on the company s operating results  gross margins and investment returns 
in addition  we believe that noi provides useful information to the investors about the performance of our operating assets 
however  due to the exclusions noted above  noi should only be used as an alternative measure of the financial performance of such assets and not as an alternative to gaap operating income loss or net income loss available to common stockholders 
for reference  and as an aid in understanding our computation of noi  a reconciliation of noi to ebt has been presented in the operating assets segment discussion below and a reconciliation of ebt to consolidated operating income loss from continuing operations as computed in accordance with gaap has been presented in note year ended december   and master planned communities segment mpc revenues vary between years based on economic conditions and several factors such as location  development density and commercial or residential use  among others 
reported gaap earnings results may differ significantly from actual cash flows generated principally because cost of sales for gaap purposes is a reduction from earnings and is derived from margins calculated using carrying values  projected future improvements and other capitalized costs in relation to future land sale revenues 
carrying values generally represent acquisition costs and improvements incurred by us and our predecessors in prior periods and may also have been previously written down through impairment charges 
expenditures for improvements in the current period are capitalized and therefore generally would not be reflected in the income statement in the current year

table of contents total segment land sales have increased to million for the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for bridgeland  summerlin and the woodlands have increased each year since columbia is nearly sold out  and has just remaining saleable acres as of december  excluding a million land sale transaction during  columbia s sales have also increased each year since in  we sold residential acres compared to and in and  respectively 
acres sold in include the bulk sale of acres at our fairwood project in columbia 
this transaction represented nearly all of the remaining saleable land at fairwood 
these acreage sales represented approximately  lot sales for  compared to  and excluding fairwood for the years ended december  and  respectively

during  residential lot sales for the woodlands and bridgeland increased and  respectively  over  while residential lot sales in increased by and  respectively  over in  the woodlands average lot prices increased by to  and bridgeland s average price per lot increased by to  over this same period 
the woodlands average lot price decreased by for the year ended december  compared to  and bridgeland s average lot prices increased by during the same period 
commercial land sales at the woodlands decreased by to million for compared to while commercial sales in increased by as compared to the decrease principally reflects a change in strategy for the woodlands since we acquired a controlling interest in in prior years  ownership favored generating cash from commercial land sales to deliver dividends to the parent companies 
we believe that the commercial land  especially within and surrounding the woodlands town center  is poised for strategic growth and we may develop and hold properties in this desirable area 
we believe that through controlling a greater share of the commercial development within the woodlands  we can better serve our customers and generate premium rents by doing so 
bridgeland had no commercial land sales during we expect minimal commercial sales until new home sales generate a critical mass of demand for local commercial retail  office and lodging properties 
the houston  texas area has benefitted from a strong energy sector 
according to the bureau of labor statistics bls  the area s unemployment rate at the end of was approximately  nearly one percentage point lower than the national average 
exxonmobil is constructing a large corporate campus on a acre site just south of the woodlands 
the site is expected to include approximately buildings  representing million square feet of space 
according to several reports  exxonmobil expects to begin relocating employees into this new location starting in and ending in we believe that the direct and indirect jobs related to this relocation will have a significantly positive impact on the woodlands and bridgeland due to increased housing demand  as well as commercial space needs for companies servicing exxonmobil 
as of december  the woodlands has approximately  residential lots remaining  which represents approximately six years of expected future sales 
bridgeland  which is in its early stages of development  has approximately  lots remaining to be developed  representing an estimated years of expected future sales 
our acquisition of our partner s interest in the woodlands has allowed us to integrate the woodland s operations into our company 
we also consolidated the management teams of the woodlands and bridgeland and expect that we can leverage the woodlands plus years of development experience to bridgeland s benefit 
residential land sales at our summerlin community improved to million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the las vegas residential market continues to be challenging 
according to the bls  the las vegas  nv area unemployment rate was approximately at the end of  four percentage points higher than the national average 
new home closings in the overall market were down approximately in compared to and 
table of contents increased in compared to the increase from to was caused primarily by the federal tax incentive for first time homebuyers 
the housing market has been burdened by foreclosures  short sales  downward price pressures and a significant percentage of the population in their current homes having negative equity 
a total of  home closings were recorded in  the lowest in years  down from its peak of nearly  units in additionally  the median price for a new home was  in  down from over  at the top of the market 
due to uncertain local economic conditions and the continued challenging housing market  it remains difficult to predict homebuilder demand 
from september to december  we had two builders that did not close on contracts representing million of potential revenues for lots in  and million of potential revenues representing lots in the builders forfeited approximately million of deposits to us for not closing on the lots 
in early builder activity at summerlin has begun to increase 
year to date through february   summerlin has entered into residential lot sale contracts with four homebuilders for lots and two superpad sites representing approximately million of revenues if all of the sales are completed 
approximately million of the sales are scheduled to occur in  with the remaining million scheduled for major items of revenues and expenses year ended december  in thousands master planned communities land sales builder price participation other land sale revenues total revenues cost of sales land land sales operations provisions for impairments depreciation and amortization interest  net total expenses venture partner share of the woodlands ebt mpc ebt our master planned communities segment includes revenues and expenses related to the woodlands at 
on july   we acquired our partner s equity interest 
as a result of the acquisition  we now consolidate the woodlands operations 
prior to the acquisition  the woodlands was accounted for using the equity method 
for a detailed breakdown of ebt  refer to note land sales increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  as compared to was million 
these year to year increases were due to factors described more fully above 
builder price participation represents the contractual percentage we collect from builder home settlements 
generally the percentage ranges from one to two percent of the home price  but can vary by contract and by community 
builder price participation has declined in each year as home settlements have slowed in summerlin and home sales in bridgeland and summerlin are at lower price points producing lower builder price participation 
the decline is also impacted by a change in strategy at the woodlands 
during land sales contracts were restructured to eliminate price participation in exchange for a greater fixed lot sale price 
participation amounts collected at lot closing are considered to be a part of land sales revenue 
other revenue for the year ended december  is million 
it is comprised of million of ground maintenance revenue and million of energy easement fees from the woodlands 
also included are million of home owner s association fees and million of income from contract defaults from summerlin and 
table of contents million in revenue recognized as a result of a reduction in a contingent purchase price obligation to a former owner at bridgeland 
the balance is made up of several income items from all of our communities 
some of these items are transfer fees  advertising fees  ground rent and interest income 
other revenue for the year ended december  increased million as compared to primarily because of the million collected from contract defaults from summerlin and million of revenue recognized as a result of a reduction in a contingent purchase price obligation at bridgeland 
these items were not present in the amount for the year ended december  as compared to is consistent 
land sales margins were  and for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the margin as compared to was principally caused by higher cost percentage attributed to the woodlands sales in the third and fourth quarters of the majority of the woodlands third and fourth quarter cost of sales reflected the finished lots at the fair value established in connection with our july  acquisition of our partner s interest 
once the approximately acquired finished lots are sold  the woodlands margins are expected to return to levels approximating 
also  summerlin sales  which have a lower margin than bridgeland and the woodlands  comprised a larger portion of total sales for than in the decline in the margins from to was due to the majority of our sales occurring in bridgeland  columbia and the woodlands in summerlin sold one custom lot and one commercial lot in costs of land sales is based on carrying values of the lots sold and varies by community based on historical purchase price of the land and improvements made  and to be made  by us  less any impairment charges previously recorded on the land 
land sales operations costs decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in as compared to is principally due to approximately million of real estate tax savings in our summerlin project as a result of a successful tax appeal  in addition to approximately million of reduced net legal costs related to development matters in our summerlin and bridgeland communities 
during  we collected approximately million of settlements which reduced our overall net legal costs 
the decrease in land sales operations costs from to is primarily related to management efforts to reduce payroll and overhead costs  marketing and other land related costs during a sluggish economy 
master planned communities recorded impairment charges of million for summerlin south and million for columbia and gateway in  and million for fairwood in there were no impairment charges in the detail of these impairment charges are described below 
interest  net reflects the amount of interest that is capitalized at the project level 
the decrease is related to lower company interest costs for the year ended december  due to our current debt structure as compared to our predecessors for the years ended december  and in addition to ebt for the master planned communities  management believes that certain investors measure the value of the assets in this segment based on their annual contribution to liquidity and capital available for investment 
accordingly  the following table sets forth mpc net contribution for the years ended  and mpc net contribution is defined as mpc ebt  plus mpc cost of sales  provisions for impairment and depreciation and amortization  and reduced by mpc development and acquisition expenditures 

table of contents mpc net contribution year ended december  in thousands mpc ebt plus cost of sales land provisions for impairments depreciation and amortization less mpc land residential development and acquisitions expenditures mpc net contribution our master planned communities segment includes revenues and expenses related to the woodlands partnerships 
on july   we acquired our partner s equity interest 
as a result of the acquisition  we now consolidate the woodlands operations into our consolidated financial statements 
prior to such acquisitions  we accounted for the woodlands using the equity method 
for a detailed breakdown of ebt  refer to note the improvement in mpc net contribution during compared to and is primarily attributable to increased land sales and the results of efforts to reduce operational costs 
although mpc net contribution can be computed from gaap elements of income and cash flows  it is not a gaap based operational metric and should not be used to measure operating performance of the mpc assets as a substitute for gaap measures of such performance 
a reconciliation of ebt to consolidated operating income loss from continuing operations as computed in accordance with gaap has been presented in note operating assets segment we view noi as an important measure of the operating performance of our operating assets 
these assets typically generate rental revenues sufficient to cover their operating costs  and variances between years in net operating income typically results from changes in rental rates  occupancy  tenant mix and operating expenses

e adjustments to noi include straight line and market lease amortization  depreciation and amortization and non real estate taxes 
retail properties ward centers noi for decreased by approximately million compared to primarily due to lower rental revenue of million principally as a result of a bankrupt tenant  higher compensation  legal  travel and other non recoverable costs of million and higher energy costs of million 
these negative variances were partially offset by lower bad debt expense of million due to the collection of aged receivables 
the million increase in noi for compared to is primarily due to new specialty leasing tenants taking occupancy in late and early south street seaport noi for increased by million compared to the increase was primarily the result of new leasing and new kiosk cart rental revenue of approximately million in addition to million of tenant receivable collections for which a reserve was established in prior years  partially offset by approximately million of higher expenses  including million higher professional and legal fees in as compared to rio west mall s noi for decreased by million as compared to primarily due to the bankruptcy of two major tenants  as well as increased overhead and property management costs 
some leasing terms were adjusted to a gross rents basis resulting in excess occupancy costs being absorbed by the property and not passed on to the tenants 
riverwalk marketplace s noi for decreased by million compared to primarily due to a one time tenant settlement of million received during this decrease was partially offset by higher specialty leasing revenues and higher tenant recoveries in landmark mall s noi for decreased by million primarily because of increased vacancies and a change from base minimum rents to percent lieu for certain tenants who are having financial difficulties 
occupancy costs for tenants on percent in lieu of rents leases are generally not recoverable  resulting in our absorbing a greater percentage of the property s operating costs 
the million decrease in noi for the year ended december  compared to resulted from one of the mall s anchor tenants vacating 
park west s noi for improved by million over principally as a result of lower property taxes from lower assessed property values in this operating asset continues to suffer from a weak market and its occupancy was at december  we are focused on attracting tenants who can drive increased traffic during the day and evening  such as entertainment concepts 
if we are unsuccessful at increasing occupancy and traffic  many of our existing tenants may be unable to continue to occupy their leased spaces because their sales volumes will likely be inadequate to support their operating costs 

table of contents and waterway avenue and waterway garage retail were completed in and  respectively and are located at the woodlands 
as of december   and waterway avenue are leased and are expected to reach stabilized annual noi of approximately million in the first quarter of waterway garage retail is leased 
before retail properties are fully leased and have stabilized  we do not think yearly comparisons are informative 
office properties all of the office properties listed in the noi schedule  except for n 
wacker and the columbia office properties  are located in the woodlands 
n 
wacker noi increased in primarily due to an increase in the tenant s rental rate effective in november waterway square was completed in and is leased as of december  the asset is expected to reach stabilized annual noi of million in the second quarter of before office properties are fully leased and have stabilized  we do not think yearly comparisons are informative 
new trails is leased as of december  the asset is expected to reach stabilized annual noi of million in the second quarter from november through january  we occupied a portion of the office space ranging from  square feet to  square feet  which represents and respectively  of the total building square footage  however  we moved into another third party owned asset in january other the woodlands resort and conference center s million increase in noi for compared to is due primarily to higher overall revenue per available room which is the average daily room rate multiplied by average occupancy  which increased to compared to for the same period in the prior year 
increased business activity and improving economic conditions at the woodlands and surrounding areas  including higher commercial occupancies  are driving increased revenue and noi as compared to revenue per available room also increased by in from in  but the increased revenues were more than offset by higher fixed costs in the club at carlton woods the club is a hole golf and country club at the woodlands with total members as of december  we estimate the club requires approximately members to achieve break even noi  and therefore we expect to incur noi losses into the foreseeable future 
the club s noi loss increased by million to million for the year ended december   however  noi includes approximately million of income relating to inactive lot incentives 
the incentives were built into the total sales price of the lots and purchasers of homes at the club  and the purchasers of such lots receive credit toward membership initiation fees at the club 
they have days after closing on the home purchase to do so 
the inactive lot incentive amount represents unused credits that had accumulated over the years 
excluding these credits  noi loss would have been million

table of contents capacity for future commercial development 
woodloch forest garage has approximately  total spaces with spaces available for future adjacent office development 
until such development is undertaken  we anticipate the excess capacity to generate losses 
noi decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily because the waterway square garage was put into service in the fourth quarter of prior to being put into service no costs would have been expensed

other property operating costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to  and decreased by million in compared to the year ended december  these costs generally include recoverable and non recoverable costs relating to our properties  with the exception of real estate taxes and maintenance costs which are shown separately 
the principal reasons for the increase in 
table of contents compared to were  a million increase related to certain insurance costs million of increased legal costs recorded at our properties  million of higher utilities costs  and million related to increased operating costs at the club 
the million decrease in other property operating costs from to was primarily attributable to lower building lease back rent for the woodlands of million which expired in depreciation expense decreased million at riverwalk and million at landmark as a result of impairment charges in prior years offset somewhat by increased depreciation expense at ward centers of million  principally relating to putting the new parking garage in service during depreciation expense for the woodlands operating assets decreased by million due to the assets being remeasured at fair value as of the date of acquisition 
the million decrease in depreciation expense from to is primarily a result of impairment taken during and the provision for bad debts in included million relating to a single tenant at south street seaport 
in  the tenant agreed to a payment plan which requires payment of current amounts when due and payment of past due balances 
as of december  the tenant has substantially complied with the agreement resulting in a favorable variance for as compared to in  interest expense decreased from prior year primarily due to the refinancing at ward centers 
in  ggp allocated interest expense of million to ward centers as part of their corporate allocations 
additionally  the early extinguishment of debt amount of million in resulted from the debt refinancing at ward centers in the third quarter 
we received distributions of million from our summerlin hospital cost investment in the first quarter of we did not receive a distribution in dividends by summerlin hospital are typically made one time per year  however  no dividends were paid in principally due to a capital project at the hospital 
approximately million of the amount received in the first quarter of relates to calendar year the remaining million relates to periods prior to which were deferred pending completion of the capital project 
strategic developments segment our strategic development assets generally require substantial future development to achieve their highest and best use 
most of the properties in this segment generate no revenues 
our expenses relating to these assets are primarily related to carrying costs  such as property taxes and insurance  and other ongoing costs relating to maintaining the assets in their current condition 
if we decide to redevelop a strategic development asset  we would expect that  upon completion of redevelopment  the asset would be reclassified to the operating assets segment and noi would become an important measure of its operating performance

this loss was partially offset by other income from various strategic development properties 
rental and other property operations decreased in as compared to primarily due to a million property tax refund resulting from a tax protest associated with our elk grove development which occurred in the first quarter of rental property operations increased million in as compared to  as certain costs such as overhead that were previously capitalized were expensed as development efforts on all of the properties in our strategic developments segment were postponed 

table of contents certain significant consolidated and combined expenses the following table contains certain significant expenses on a consolidated and combined basis that are not otherwise included within the segment analyses 
variances related to income and expenses included in noi or ebt are explained within the segment variance discussion contained within this item using the combined consolidated and proportionate share of our non consolidated real estate affiliates revenues and expenses associated with the related segment 
significant variances for combined expenses not included in noi or ebt are described below 
year ended december  in thousands general and administrative provisions for impairment depreciation and amortization interest income interest expense early extinguishment of debt warrant liability gain loss investment in real estate affiliate basis adjustment benefit for income taxes equity in earnings from real estate affiliates reorganization items we did not become a public company and did not operate as an entity separate from ggp until november   therefore  our and financial results reflect allocations made by ggp for general and administrative expenses based on actual costs incurred  or are based upon our percentage of ggp s total assets and revenues 
since our separation from ggp  we have been operating as an independent public company and have been building our organization to analyze  create and implement development plans for our assets 
on july   we consolidated the operations of the woodlands  increasing our employee base from employees to employees at december  for these reasons  we do not believe that current year general and administrative expenses are comparable to prior year amounts 
our general and administrative costs for totaled million  of which million was attributable to the woodlands 
general and administrative expenses of million  excluding the woodlands  increased by million over  principally due to infrastructure growth and our becoming an independent public company on november  non equity based compensation costs totaled approximately million and non cash stock compensation costs totaled million for the year ended december  if all corporate personnel employed as of december  and whose compensation is included in general administrative expenses had been employed as of january   we estimate our cash compensation costs would have been approximately million for for  our consulting  transitional services  recruiting and temporary staffing costs were approximately million 
many of these costs relate to our transition to an independent public company and the building of infrastructure 
we expect these costs to be significantly lower in legal  accounting  internal audit and other professional services totaled million for the remaining million of costs primarily represent occupancy  travel  it infrastructure and public company costs 
reorganization items under the bankruptcy filings are expense or income items that were incurred or realized as a result of the bankruptcy filings under chapter these items include professional fees and similar types of expenses incurred directly related to the bankruptcy filings  gains or losses resulting from activities of the reorganization process  including gains related to recording the mortgage debt at fair value upon emergence from bankruptcy and interest earned on cash accumulated by the debtors 
due to the consummation of the reoganization plan in november  no items were classified as reorganization items in see note reorganization items for additional detail 

table of contents emergence initiatives  included in general and administrative costs  for the year ended december  consist of professional fees for restructuring that were incurred prior to the filing for protection under the bankruptcy code of certain of our subsidiaries 
similar costs incurred after filing for protection under the bankruptcy code are recorded as reorganization items 
impairments we evaluate our real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability in this context means that the expected cumulative undiscounted future cash flows of an asset are less than its carrying value 
the recoverability analysis  as an accounting concept  considers hold periods  but ignores when the future cash flows are expected to be received within that hold period and whether we currently expect to receive an above or below market rate of return over our anticipated holding period 
if expected cumulative undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  then we are required to record the asset at the lower of its carrying value or fair value 
the process for deriving fair value involves discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate of return that we believe an investor would require based on the risk profile of the cash flows and returns available in the market for other investments having similar risk 
we may also use other inputs such as appraisals and recent transactions for comparable properties  if appropriate 
book value for assets that have been recently impaired from an accounting perspective may more likely reflect market value than book values of assets that have not been impaired  consequently  unimpaired assets may be expected to generate above or below market returns relative to their respective book values 
the lower book basis resulting from an impairment charge increases reported profitability from the asset in future periods  but has no impact on cash flow 
as of december  we evaluated whether impairment indicators existed at all of our assets 
in most instances  we concluded no impairment indicators were present 
when indicators of impairment were present  we reconsidered expected cash flows and concluded that there were no impairments 
we recorded million and million of impairment charges for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are focused on maximizing value for stockholders 
to achieve this  we seek to implement strategies that increase the value of an asset  not necessarily the aggregate of its future undiscounted cash flows 
as such  a given strategy may result in an accounting impairment charge even though we believe that such strategy will maximize the value of the asset 
master planned communities impairments impairment charges to our master planned communities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no impairments recorded for the year ended december  large master planned community assets by their nature have characteristics that may create a wider range of outcomes in an impairment analysis compared to other types of real estate such as office  retail and industrial facilities 
unlike operating real estate  master planned community assets have extended life cycles that may last to years and have few long term contractual cash flows such as operating lease revenue 
further  the majority of the master planned community assets generally have minimal to no residual values because of their liquidating characteristics and development periods often occur through several economic cycles 
subjective factors such as the expected timing of property development and sales  optimal development density and sales strategy impact the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and fair value 
our master planned communities comprise thousands of acres that include distinct communities 
our management team may implement development strategies for those communities that are different than those planned by our predecessors 
such strategies vary from those of our predecessors and may warrant separate impairment evaluation for regions or projects within a single master planned community if we believe the cash flows for those assets are independent from other regions or projects within the community 
separating master planned communities into multiple entities for impairment testing may result in a different accounting conclusion than if the community was evaluated as a whole  however  the accounting has no impact on economic value or fair value 

table of contents our two remaining developable summerlin regions south and west are separated for impairment testing because their characteristics and future business plans are distinct 
in december  we modified our business plans for summerlin south based on our expectation to replace high density product with low density product  change the strategy from developing and selling finished lots to the sale of undeveloped pads  and reduce saleable acre assumptions for a high end village having significant topography and development challenges 
as a result  projected undiscounted future cash flows for summerlin south were less than its then carrying value and this asset was impaired as of december  we recorded a million pre tax charge to write down summerlin south to its estimated million fair value at december  at december   we also recorded million and million pre tax impairment charges for the columbia and gateway  maryland properties  respectively 
columbia was written down to a million fair value based on a ten year land sale program for the future mixed use development of million square feet 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment charge for the fairway  maryland property 
operating assets impairments there were no impairments recorded for the year ended december  operating property pre tax impairments within our operating assets segment totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
riverwalk marketplace and landmark properties were impaired by million and million  respectively  and their estimated fair values were million and million  respectively  as of december  riverwalk was evaluated based on our current plan to reposition and hold the asset for an year period  and we applied an discount rate to the estimated future cash flows and derived a residual value on the leasehold interest using a capitalization rate 
the landmark property impairment is based on an appraisal which incorporates many factors including  but not limited to  physical condition  location  demographics and retail market condition 
for the year ended december   we took a million pre tax impairment charge relating to the landmark property 
we have not yet created a specific re development plan for this asset 
strategic developments impairments there were no impairments recorded for the year ended december  strategic developments properties pre tax impairments totaled million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
century plaza mall birmingham  al and nouvelle at natick natick  ma properties were impaired by million and million  respectively  and their estimated fair values are million and million  respectively  as of december  century plaza mall is a vacant property for which we do not currently have a re development plan  and the impairment is based upon our best estimates utilizing  among other things  a broker s opinion of value 
nouvelle is a condominium development for which the estimated fair value is based on discounted cash flow analysis of the remaining units available for sale 
the impairments for the year ended december  relate to ten strategic development assets 
elk grove promenade and the shops at summerlin centre were the largest two impairments at million and million  respectively 
two regions within our master planned communities had impairment indicators and carrying values in excess of estimated fair value at december  aggregate undiscounted cash flows for such master planned communities projects significantly exceeded their respective aggregate book values and therefore no impairment provisions were required with respect to such projects at december  the significant assumptions in our master planned communities segment relate to future sales prices of land and future development costs needed to prepare land for sale  over the planned life of the project  which are based  in part  on assumptions regarding sales pace  timing of related development costs  and the impact of inflation and other market factors 
with respect to operating properties within our operating assets segment at december   there were three operating properties which had impairment indicators 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows for such operating properties exceeded their book values by 
a significant assumption for these operating properties is our 
table of contents future revenue assumption 
the combined book value of the three properties is million 
a reduction of the estimated undiscounted cash by would result in the impairment of park west 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the years ended december  and  primarily resulted from the decrease in the carrying amount of buildings and equipment due to the impairment charges recorded in and all interest expense for was capitalized as part of the development costs within the master planned community and strategic developments segments in accordance with our capitalized interest policy 
we recognized a loss of million during the third quarter of related to the debt refinancing at ward centers 
the million represented the unamortized market rate adjustment as of the date of refinancing 
interest expense increased during the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in the amortization of debt market rate adjustments  partially offset by a million decrease in the amortization of deferred finance costs 
the increase in the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the creation of certain deferred tax assets prior to separation from ggp as a result of the transfer of certain of our predecessors reit assets to taxable entities for more information see note and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities due to our impairments  partially offset by a significant increase in valuation allowances compared to the year ended december  the million increase in our equity in income loss of real estate affiliates in was primarily due to the recognition of million of impairment on our investment in circle t as well as the recognition in by the circle t venture of impairment of million  of which our share was million 
see note for additional information on our real estate affiliates 
reorganization items under the bankruptcy filings are expense or income items that were incurred or realized by our predecessors as a result of their bankruptcy 
these items include professional fees and similar types of expenses incurred directly related to the bankruptcy filings  gains or losses resulting from activities of the reorganization process  including gains related to recording the mortgage debt at fair value upon emergence from bankruptcy and interest earned on cash accumulated by the our predecessors 
see note reorganization items for additional detail 
our net loss in reflects our operations prior to and subsequent to the spin off from ggp 
income for the period prior to the spin off  as detailed in the accompanying statement of equity  was attributable to ggp and reflects significant income tax benefits from restructuring 
for more information see note the loss subsequent to the spin off of million is primarily attributable to the impairment charges and warrant liability expense described above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash for include cash flow from land sales in our master planned communities segment  cash generated from our operating assets  condominium sales proceeds  net proceeds from asset sales and first mortgage financings secured by our assets 
our primary uses of cash include working capital  overhead  debt repayment  property improvements  pre development and development costs 
we believe that our sources of cash  including existing cash on hand and available credit  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing contracted obligations  and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next twelve months 
the pursuit of development and re development opportunities in our operating assets and strategic developments segments are capital intensive and will require significant additional funding 
we intend to raise this additional funding with a mix of construction  bridge and long term financings  by entering into joint venture arrangements and the sale of non core assets at the appropriate time 

table of contents the negative operating cash flows prior to presented in this annual report on form k primarily were the result of reorganization items of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as well as costs associated with land residential development and acquisitions expenditures in our master planned communities segment of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the funds for these expenditures came from ggp and are reflected in our consolidated and combined statement of cash flows in change in ggp investment  net

on december   we secured a million loan for waterway square and new trails 
proceeds from the loan were partially used to refinance a million mortgage secured by new trails 
the excess proceeds were used to partially repay the credit facility at the woodlands and to increase cash 
the loan matures on december  and has a fixed interest rate of 
on september   we closed on a million first mortgage financing secured by the ward centers in honolulu  hawaii  which bears interest at libor plus 
the loan matures on september   and we entered into an interest rate swap pursuant to which million of the principal balance was fixed at a interest rate for the term of the loan 
initial loan proceeds of approximately million were used to repay approximately million of mortgage debt and to fund closing costs 
we were advanced an additional million in the fourth quarter of also  the loan may be drawn to a maximum million to fund capital expenditures at the property  provided that maximum leverage cannot exceed the lesser of of the property s appraised value and a debt yield 
at december   the loan had a million outstanding balance 
in march  the woodlands refinanced a portion of its debt by entering into a million credit facility which matures in and a million financing which has an initial maturity in at december   there was approximately million of undrawn borrowing availability under the credit facility 
the following table summarizes our net debt on a segment basis 
net debt is defined as our share of mortgages  notes and loans payable  at our ownership share  reduced by short term liquidity sources to satisfy obligations such as our ownership share of cash and cash equivalents and special improvement district receivables 
although net debt is not a recognized gaap financial measure  it is readily computable from existing gaap information and we believe  as with our other non gaap measures  that such information is useful to our investors and other users of our financial statements

see note for more detail on this entity s ability to remain qualified as a reit 
seasonality revenues from development  redevelopment or sale of property in our master planned communities segment and strategic developments segment are not subject to seasonal variations 
rental income recognized  including overage rent  is higher during the second half of the year for some of our operating assets 
as a result  rental revenue production in the operating assets segment is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
additionally  some of the retail properties in our operating assets segment are subject to seasonal variations  with a significant portion of their sales and earnings occurring during the last two months of the year 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for example  significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to the fair value of assets for measuring impairment  valuation of debt of emerged entities  useful lives of assets  capitalization of development and leasing costs  provision for income taxes  recoverable amounts of receivables and deferred taxes  initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles  and cost ratios and completion percentages used for land sales 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the following impairment properties  developments in progress and master planned communities assets we review our real estate assets  including operating assets  land held for development and sale and developments in progress  for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to impairment of long lived assets 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates 
impairment indicators for our master planned communities segment are assessed separately for each community and in certain circumstances  regions or projects within the community  and include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in sales pace and decreasing average selling prices 
we also monitor local economic conditions and other factors that may relieve demand expectation 
impairment indicators for pre development costs  which are typically costs incurred during the beginning stages of a potential development  and developments in progress are assessed by project and include  but are not limited to  significant changes in projected completion dates  revenues or cash flows  development costs  market factors and the feasibility of development projects 
impairment indicators for our operating assets segment are assessed separately for each property and include  but are not limited to  significant decreases net operating income  significant decreases in occupancy or low occupancy and significant net operating losses 
impairment indicators for our strategic developments segment are assessed separately for each property and include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in comparable property sale prices 
if an indicator of potential impairment exists  the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow 
significant assumptions used in the estimation of future undiscounted cash flow include  for the master planned communities  estimates of future lot sales  costs to complete and sales pace  and for properties in our operating assets segment and strategic developments segment  future market rents  renewals and capital expenditures 
historical experience in such matters and future economic projections were used to establish such factors 
these factors are subject to uncertainty 
a real estate asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount cannot be recovered through estimated future 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows and the carrying value is less than the fair value 
to the extent an impairment provision is necessary  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to operations 
in addition  the impairment is allocated proportionately to adjust the carrying amount of the asset 
the adjusted carrying amount for operating assets  which represents the new cost basis of the asset  is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the adjusted carrying amount for master planned communities is recovered through future land sales 
recoverable amounts of receivables and deferred tax assets we make periodic assessments of the collectability of receivables including those resulting from the difference between rental revenue recognized and rents currently due from tenants and the recoverability of deferred taxes based on a specific review of the risk of loss on specific accounts or amounts 
the receivable analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history and financial condition of the payee  the basis for any disputes or negotiations with the payee and other information which may impact collectability 
for straight line rents receivable  the analysis considers the probability of collection of the unbilled deferred rent receivable given our experience regarding such amounts 
for deferred tax assets  an assessment of the recoverability of the tax asset considers the current expiration periods of the prior net operating loss carry forwards or other tax attributes and our estimated future taxable income generated by deferred tax liabilities 
the resulting estimates of any allowance or reserve related to the recovery of these items is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on such payees 
capitalization of development and leasing costs we capitalize the costs of development and leasing activities of our properties 
these costs are incurred both at the property location and at the regional and corporate office levels 
the amount of capitalization depends  in part  on the identification and justifiable allocation of certain activities to specific projects and leases 
differences in methodologies of cost identification and documentation  as well as differing assumptions as to the time incurred on projects  can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized and  as a result  the amount of depreciation recognized 
revenue recognition and related matters revenues from land sales are recognized using the full accrual method provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the transactions and our subsequent involvement with the land sold are met 
revenues relating to transactions that do not meet the established criteria are deferred and recognized when the criteria are met or using the installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  in the circumstances 
in addition  in certain land sale transactions  we also share in a percentage of the builders finished home sales revenue  which we term builder s price participation 
for land sale transactions in which we are required to perform additional services and incur significant costs after title has passed  revenues and cost of sales are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
cost ratios for land sales are determined as a specified percentage of land sales revenues recognized for each master planned community project 
the cost ratios used are based on actual costs incurred and estimates of development costs and sales revenues through completion of each project 
the ratios are reviewed regularly and revised for changes in sales and cost estimates or development plans 
significant changes in these estimates or development plans  whether due to changes in market conditions or other factors  could result in changes to the cost ratio used for a specific project 
the specific identification method is used to determine cost of sales for certain parcels of land  including acquired parcels we do not intend to develop or for which development is complete at the date of acquisition 
minimum rent revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
minimum rent revenues also include amounts collected from tenants to allow the termination of their leases prior to their 
table of contents scheduled termination dates and accretion related to above and below market tenant leases on acquired properties 
straight line rents receivable represent the current net cumulative rents recognized prior to when billed and collectible as provided by the terms of the leases 
overage rent is recognized on an accrual basis once tenant sales exceed contractual tenant lease thresholds 
recoveries from tenants are established in the leases or computed based upon a formula related to real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses and are generally recognized as revenues in the period the related costs are incurred 
purchase price allocation upon the acquisition of real estate properties  we recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest as of the acquisition date  measured at their fair values 
in allocating the purchase price of each of our properties  management makes assumptions and uses various estimates  including  but not limited to  the estimated useful lives of the assets  the cost of replacing certain assets  discount rates used to determine present values  market rental rates per square foot and the period required to lease the property up to its occupancy at acquisition if it were vacant 
many of these estimates are obtained from independent third party appraisals 
however  management is responsible for the source and use of these estimates 
a change in these estimates and assumptions could result in the various categories of our real estate assets and or related intangibles being overstated or understated which could result in an overstatement or understatement of depreciation and or amortization expense and or rental revenue 
these variances could be material to our financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements and developments new accounting pronouncements have been issued which impact or could impact the prior  current or subsequent years 
see note for additional information about new accounting pronouncements 
inflation revenue from our operating assets may be impacted by inflation 
in addition  materials and labor costs relating to our development activities may significantly increase in an inflationary environment 
finally  inflation poses a risk to us due to the possibility of future increases in interest rates in the context of loan refinancings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed rate financing in that changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of our fixed rate financing and with respect to our floating rate financings in that increases in interest rates could adversely affect cash flow 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding of which million has been swapped to a fixed rate 
annual interest expense would increase approximately million for every increase in interest rates on this balance 
generally  our interest expense is capitalizable  therefore  the impact on our statement of income loss is expected to be minimal 
for additional information concerning our debt  and management s estimation process to arrive at a fair value of our debt as required by gaap  reference is made to item  the liquidity and capital resources discussion above and to notes and we seek to manage a portion of our floating rate interest exposure by using interest rates swaps and caps
