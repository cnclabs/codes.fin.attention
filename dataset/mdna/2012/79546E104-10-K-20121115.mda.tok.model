overview description of business we operate primarily through two business units  sally beauty supply and beauty systems group  or bsg 
through sally beauty supply and bsg  we operated a multi channel platform of  company operated stores and supplied franchised stores  primarily in north america  south america and selected european countries  as of september  we are the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
within bsg  we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in north america 
we provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third party branded and exclusive label professional beauty supplies  including hair color products  hair care products  styling appliances  skin and nail care products and other beauty items 
sally beauty supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals  while bsg exclusively targets salons and salon professionals 
for the year ended september   our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were  million and million  respectively 
we believe sally beauty supply is the largest open line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
as of september   sally beauty supply operated  company operated retail stores   of which are located in the us  with the remaining company operated stores located in puerto rico  canada  mexico  chile  the united kingdom  ireland  belgium  france  germany  the netherlands and spain 
sally beauty supply also supplied franchised stores located outside the us in the us and canada  our sally beauty supply stores average approximately  square feet in size and are located primarily in strip shopping centers 
our sally beauty supply stores carry an extensive selection of professional beauty supplies for both retail customers and salon professionals  with between  and  skus of beauty products across product categories including hair color  hair care  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and electrical appliances 
sally beauty supply stores carry leading third party brands such as clairol  revlon and conair  as well as an extensive selection of exclusive label merchandise 
store formats  including average size and product selection  for sally beauty supply outside the us and canada vary by marketplace 
for the year ended september   sally beauty supply s net sales and segment operating profit were  million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses and share based compensation expenses  respectively 
we believe bsg is the largest full service distributor of professional beauty supplies in north america  exclusively targeting salons and salon professionals 
as of september   bsg had  company operated stores  supplied franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately  professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in all states in the us  in 
table of contents portions of canada  and in puerto rico  mexico and certain european countries 
company operated bsg stores  which primarily operate under the cosmoprof banner  average approximately  square feet in size and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers 
bsg stores provide a comprehensive selection of between  and  beauty product skus that include hair color and care  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and electrical appliances 
through bsg s large store base and sales force  bsg is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented us salon channel 
bsg stores carry leading third party brands such as paul mitchell  wella  sebastian  goldwell  joico and aquage  intended for use in salons and for resale by the salons to consumers 
certain bsg products are sold under exclusive distribution agreements with suppliers  whereby bsg is designated as the sole distributor for a product line within certain geographic territories 
for the year ended september   bsg s net sales and segment operating profit were  million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and consolidated operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses and share based compensation expenses  respectively 
industry and business trends we operate primarily within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in consumer demand for hair color  hair loss prevention and hair styling products 
we believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward high level of marketplace fragmentation 
the us salon channel is highly fragmented with nearly  salons and barbershops 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting and frequent stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
in addition  booth renters  who comprise a significant percentage of total us salon professionals  are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals  and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
we expect that these factors will continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of exclusive label professional beauty products 
as our lines of exclusive label products have matured and become better known in our retail stores  we have seen an increase in sales of these products 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins for us than the leading third party branded products and  accordingly  we believe that the growth in sales of these products will likely enhance our overall gross margins 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
we expect the aging baby boomer population to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends largely on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
we continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the 
table of contents marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
please see risk factors we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and buying trends or manage our product lines and inventory commensurate with consumer demand 
international growth strategies 
a key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in the international marketplace and to grow our current level of non us operations 
for example  in november  we acquired the floral group  a distributor of professional beauty products then with stores located in the netherlands  in december  we acquired sinelco group bvba sinelco  a wholesale distributor of professional beauty products located in belgium with sales throughout europe  and  in september  we acquired distribuidora intersalon limitada intersalon  a distributor of premier beauty supply products then with stores located in chile 
these acquisitions furthered our expansion plans in europe and latin america  key targets of the company s international growth initiative 
we intend to continue to identify and evaluate non us acquisition and or organic international growth opportunities 
our ability to grow our non us operations  integrate our new non us acquisitions and successfully pursue additional non us acquisition and or organic international growth opportunities may be affected by business  legal  regulatory and economic risks 
please see risk factors we may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates or successfully complete desirable acquisitions  if we acquire any businesses in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal  regulatory and economic risks 
continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including the evaluation of opportunities to shift business from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic  value added acquisitions which complement our long term growth strategy 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with a broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  l oreal has acquired distributors that compete with bsg in the midwest  southeast and west coast regions of the us and  as a result  l oreal directly competes with bsg in certain geographic areas 
if l oreal or any of our other suppliers acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with bsg  we could lose related revenue 
there can be no assurance that bsg will not lose further revenue over time including within its franchise based business due to potential losses of additional products both from l oreal and from other suppliers as well as from the increased competition from distribution networks affiliated with l oreal or any of our other suppliers 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating and we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
relationships with suppliers 
sally beauty supply and bsg  and their respective suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell 
we purchase our products from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is typical in distribution businesses particularly in our industry  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines 
since we purchase products from many manufacturers on an at will basis  under contracts which can generally be terminated 
table of contents without cause upon days notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal  such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period 
some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements 
in such cases  we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and vendors may change the terms upon which they sell 
infrequently  a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
we expect to continue to expand our product line offerings and to gain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiation with suppliers or by acquisitions of existing distributors 
although we focus on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships  there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply stores  professional only beauty supply stores  salons  mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as sellers on the internet and salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating 
economic conditions 
we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of professional beauty products sold directly to retail consumers  and salons and salon professionals 
historically  these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
however  a downturn in the economy  especially for an extended period of time  could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  particularly affecting our electrical products category and our full service sales business 
in addition  higher freight costs resulting from increases in the cost of fuel  especially for an extended period of time  may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
please see risk factors the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs  especially in our bsg business segment  by right sizing the business and maximizing the efficiency of our business structure 
for example  we completed a million capital spending program to consolidate warehouses and reduce administrative expenses related to bsg s distribution network which has resulted in annualized cost savings of at least million 
please see risk factors we are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful 
opening new stores 
our future growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas 
the capital requirements to open a us based sally beauty supply or bsg store  excluding inventory  average approximately  and  respectively  with the capital requirements for international stores costing less 
table of contents or substantially more depending upon the marketplace 
we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors if we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes to our information technology systems 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
for example  we are in the process of designing and implementing a standardized enterprise resource planning erp system internationally  which we anticipate will be completed over the next few years 
in addition  we are currently implementing a point of sale system upgrade program in a number of our divisions primarily in our sally beauty supply operations in the us  which we anticipate will provide significant benefits  including enhanced tracking of customer sales and store inventory activity 
these and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology or new technology  now or in the future  will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in completion of these projects 
many of our systems are proprietary  and as a result our options are limited in seeking third party help with the operation and upgrade of those systems 
there can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades  service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology and customer issues therewith  or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting  business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors we may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems

our separation from alberto culver in november  sally beauty separated from the alberto culver company  which we refer to as alberto culver  and its consumer products focused business and became an independent company listed on the new york stock exchange hereafter  the separation transactions 
sally beauty is a holding company and does not have any material assets or operations other than its ownership of equity interests of its subsidiaries 
in connection with the separation transactions  cdrs acquisition llc or cdrs and cd r parallel fund vii  lp  investment funds associated with clayton  dubilier rice  llc together with cdrs  the cdr investors acquired of our common stock on an undiluted basis 
during the fiscal year ended september   the cdr investors sold all of their shares of our common stock through a series of underwritten public offerings and a share repurchase  pursuant to which we repurchased and subsequently retired million shares of our common stock from the cdr investors at a price equal to per share 
the company funded this million stock repurchase primarily with borrowings in the amount of million under the abl facility and with cash from operations

other significant items derivative instruments as a multinational corporation  we are subject to certain market risks including changes in market interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
we may consider a variety of practices in the ordinary course of 
table of contents business to manage these market risks  including  when deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency options  collars and forwards hereafter  foreign exchange contracts 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency derivative instruments we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries including intercompany notes not permanently invested and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the chilean peso  and the mexican peso 
our various foreign currency exposures at times offset each other  sometimes providing a natural hedge against foreign currency risk 
in connection with the remaining foreign currency risk  the company from time to time uses foreign exchange contracts to effectively fix the foreign currency exchange rate applicable to specific anticipated foreign currency denominated cash flows  thus limiting the potential fluctuations in such cash flows resulting from foreign currency market movements 
the company uses foreign exchange contracts including  at september   foreign currency forwards with an aggregate notional amount of million to manage the exposure to the us dollar resulting from certain of our sinelco group subsidiaries purchases of merchandise from third party suppliers 
sinelco s functional currency is the euro 
these foreign currency forwards enable sinelco to buy us dollars at a contractual exchange rate of  are with a single counterparty and expire ratably through september the company also uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with certain intercompany balances not permanently invested
