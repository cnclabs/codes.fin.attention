the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview pennantpark investment corporation is a bdc  whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments primarily in us middle market companies in the form of senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments 

table of contents we believe the middle market offers attractive risk reward to investors due to the limited amount of capital available for such companies 
we seek to create a diversified portfolio that includes senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments by investing approximately million to million of capital  on average  in the securities of middle market companies 
we use the term middle market to refer to companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
we expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base 
the companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged  and  in most cases  are not rated by national rating agencies 
if such companies were rated  we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade between bb and ccc under the standard poor s system from the national rating agencies 
in addition  we expect our debt investments to generally range in maturity from three to ten years 
our investment activity depends on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
turmoil in the credit markets over the last several years has adversely affected each of these factors and has resulted in a broad based reduction in the demand for  and valuation of  middle market debt instruments 
these conditions have presented us with and may continue to offer attractive investment opportunities  as we believe that there are many middle market companies that need senior secured and mezzanine debt financing 
we have used  and expect to continue to use  our credit facility  the sba debentures  proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives 
organization and structure of pennantpark investment corporation pennantpark investment corporation was organized under the maryland general corporation law in january we are a closed end  externally managed  non diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to hold at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of us private companies or thinly traded public companies  public companies with a market capitalization of less than million  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for tax purposes we intend to continue to be treated as a ric and qualify annually under the code 
our wholly owned subsidiary  sbic lp  was organized as a delaware limited partnership in may and received a license from the sba to operate as an sbic  under section c of the act  in july sbic lp s objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments generally by investing with us in sba eligible businesses that meet the investment criteria used by pennantpark investment 
our investment activities are managed by the investment adviser 
under our investment management agreement  we have agreed to pay our investment adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance 
pennantpark investment  through the investment adviser  provides similar services to sbic lp under its investment management agreement 
the sbic lp investment management agreement does not affect the management and incentive fees on a consolidated basis 
we have also entered into the administration agreement with the administrator 
under our administration agreement  we have agreed to reimburse the administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
pennantpark investment  through the administrator  provides similar services to sbic lp under its administration agreement with us 
our board of directors  a majority of whom are independent of us  and the investment adviser  supervise our activities 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold 
capital gains  if any  are recorded on a trade basis on investments held in our portfolio 
our debt investments  whether in the form of senior secured loans or mezzanine debt  typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments and pik interest 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of amendment  commitment  oid origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees to our investment adviser  our allocable portion of overhead under our administration agreement and other operating costs as detailed below 
our management fee compensates our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  consummating and monitoring our investments 
additionally  we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt we accrue under our credit facility and sba debentures 
we bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including the cost of calculating our net asset value  including the cost of any third party valuation services  
table of contents the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities  fees payable to third parties relating to  or associated with  making investments  including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complimentary businesses  expenses incurred by the investment adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts  federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees  federal  state and local taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  brokerage commissions  fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums  direct costs such as printing  mailing  long distance telephone and staff  fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs  costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the act  the act and applicable federal and state securities laws  and all other expenses incurred by either the administrator or us in connection with administering our business  including payments under our administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead  and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
during periods of asset growth  we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above 
portfolio and investment activity as of september   our portfolio totaled million and consisted of million of senior secured loans  million of second lien secured debt  million of subordinated debt and million of preferred and common equity investments

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions 
references to the asc serve as a single source of literature 
subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments our investments generally consist of illiquid securities including debt and equity investments 
our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available 
we obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers  if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
if our board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment  it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
investments of sufficient credit quality purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value in the absence of any unusual events that may indicate such basis for deriving fair value is no longer valid 
we expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments which are or will be in our portfolio  and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy described in this report and a consistently applied valuation process 
with respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value  the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include  as relevant  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the price used in an actual transaction may differ from our valuation and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our investment adviser  our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment 
the independent valuation firms review management s preliminary valuations in light of its own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service  broker  dealer or market maker  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our investment adviser and those of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments  and our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith  based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
fair value  as defined under asc  is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability 
asc emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  including assumptions about risk 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date 

table of contents asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies level inputs that are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by us at the measurement date 
level inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term  if applicable  of the financial instrument 
level inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
generally  most of our investments and our credit facility are classified as level due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material 
a review of fair value hierarchy classifications in conducted on a quarterly basis 
in addition to using the above inputs in cash equivalents  investments and our credit facility valuations  we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with asc consistent with our valuation policy  we evaluate the source of inputs  including any markets in which our investments are trading  in determining fair value 
the carrying value of our selected financial liabilities approximates fair value 
we adopted asc  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and made an irrevocable election to apply asc to our credit facility 
we elected to use the fair value option for the credit facility to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes 
due to that election and in accordance with gaap  we incurred up front fees of million which represents transaction costs and expenses related to the amended credit facility 
asc establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
asc also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and changes in fair value of the credit facility are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we elected not to apply asc to any other financial assets or liabilities  including the sba debentures 
for the fiscal year ended september  and  our credit facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation of million and million  respectively 
as of september  and  net unrealized depreciation on our credit facility totaled million and million  respectively 
we use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of our credit facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value investments 
revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt investments with contractual pik interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will generally not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  oid  market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on our debt are capitalized  and we then amortize such amounts as interest income or expense  as applicable  using the effective interest method 
we record contractual prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  using the specific identification method  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
payment in kind interest we have investments in our portfolio which contain a pik interest provision 
pik interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income 
for us to maintain our status as a ric  substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not collected any cash with respect to pik securities 

table of contents federal income taxes we operate so as to qualify to maintain our election to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code and intend to continue to do so 
to maintain ric tax benefits  we must  among other requirements  meet certain source of income and quarterly asset diversification requirements as described below 
we also must annually distribute dividends of at least of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  in order to preclude the imposition of a nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on rics  we may distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our net ordinary income for the calendar year  of the sum of our realized net capital gains for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and the sum of any net ordinary income plus net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
in addition  although we may distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above  we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or net ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity 
because federal income tax regulations differ from gaap  distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes 
differences may be permanent or temporary 
permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character 
temporary differences arise when certain items of income  expense  gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future 
differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes 
recent tax developments recently enacted legislation may require certain non corporate us holders to pay a medicare tax on  among other things  interest on and capital gains from the sale  exchange  redemption or retirement of our common stock 
this legislation would apply for taxable years beginning after december  us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect  if any  of this legislation

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of security offerings  our credit facility  sba debentures and cash flows from operations  including investment sales and repayments  and income earned 
our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur 
we have used  and expect to continue to use  our credit facility  sba debentures  proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives 
in february  we amended and restated our multi currency credit facility  which increased the size of the credit facility to million  with certain lenders and suntrust bank  acting as administrative agent and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as syndication agent for the lenders 
as of september  and  there was million including a temporary draw of million and million  respectively  in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  with a weighted average interest rate at the time of and  exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments of and  respectively 
the credit facility is a four year revolving facility with a stated maturity date of february  and a one year term out period following its third year 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at basis points over libor 
as of september  and  we had million and million of unused borrowing capacity  respectively  subject to the regulatory restrictions that the act imposes on us as a bdc 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding assets held by our sbic lp 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum shareholders equity of the sum of a million plus b of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in us and our subsidiaries after the closing date of the credit facility and maintenance of a ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness of not less than before any exemptive relief granted by the sec with respect to the indebtedness of our sbic subsidiary 
in addition to the asset coverage ratio described in the preceding sentence  borrowings under our credit facility and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt are subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the company s portfolio 
for a complete list of covenants contained in the credit facility  see our form k filed on february  and the credit facility agreement filed as an exhibit to our form q filed on may  as of september   we were in compliance with the terms of our credit facility 
we may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration and private offerings of securities  by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrowing from the sba  among other sources 
any future additional debt capital we incur  to the extent it is available  may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than our current credit facility 
furthermore  our credit facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions 
the primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness  investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our shareholders or for other general corporate or strategic purposes 
in accordance with the act  with certain limited exceptions  pennantpark investment is only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is met after such borrowing 
as of september   we excluded the principal amounts of our sba debentures  from our asset coverage ratio pursuant to an sec exemptive relief resulting in an asset coverage ratio of 
as a result of this exemptive relief  our asset coverage ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis  including the principal amount of our sba debentures  to outstanding indebtedness may be less than  which while providing increased investment flexibility  also increases our exposure to risks associated with leverage 
for the fiscal year ended september  we sold million shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on september   we raised net proceeds of million from selling million shares 
this compares to selling million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of million for the fiscal year ended september  any decision to sell shares below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock is subject to shareholder approval and a determination by our board of directors that such issuance and sale is in our and our stockholders best interests 
any sale or other issuance of shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share results in immediate dilution to our stockholders interests in our common stock and a reduction in our net asset value per share 
sbic lp has borrowed funds from the sba against regulatory capital which approximates equity capital that is paid in and is subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not limited to an examination by the sba 
as of september   we committed and funded sbic lp with million of equity capital  and had sba debentures outstanding of million 
sba debentures are non recourse to us  have a year maturity and may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the interest rate of sba debentures is fixed at the time of issuance  often referred to as pooling date  at a market driven spread over year us treasury notes 
sba current regulations limit the amount that sbic lp may borrow to a maximum of million  which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital 
sbic lp has accessed the maximum borrowing permitted by the sba with its million in regulatory capital 

table of contents as of september  and  our million in debt commitments were fully drawn with a weighted average interest rate of exclusive of the in upfront fees after upfront fees 
the sba debentures upfront fees of consist of a commitment fee of and an issuance at a discount to face 
both fees will be amortized over the lives of the loans 
our fixed rate sba debentures as of september  and are as follows issuance dates maturity all in coupon rate principal balance september  september   march  march   september  september   weighted average rate total excludes of upfront fees 
the sbic program is designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses 
under sba regulations  sbic lp is subject to regulatory requirements  including making investments in sba eligible businesses  investing at least of regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses  as defined under the act  placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments  prohibiting investment in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us  and is subject to periodic audits and examinations of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than gaap for example  fair value  as defined under asc  is not required to be used for assets or liabilities for such compliance reporting 
as of september   sbic lp was in compliance with all sba regulatory requirements 
on june   we received exemptive relief from the sec allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude the sba debentures from the calculation 
accordingly  our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding indebtedness may be less than  which while providing increased investment flexibility  would also increase our exposure to risks associated with leverage 
our net asset value may decline as a result of economic conditions in the united states 
our continued compliance with the covenants under our credit facility and sba debentures depend on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
material net asset devaluation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could require us to reduce our borrowings under our credit facility and sba debentures in order to comply with certain covenants  including the asset coverage ratio 
our operating activities used cash of million for the fiscal year ended september   and our financing activities provided cash proceeds of million for the same period

if any of our contractual obligations discussed above is terminated  our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase 
in addition  we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently engage in no off balance sheet arrangements  including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices 
dividends and distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to not be subject to corporate level tax on income  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute annually dividends of at least of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  in order to preclude the imposition of a nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on rics  we may distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our net ordinary income for the calendar year  of our realized net capital gains for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any net ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
in addition  although we may distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may retain such net capital gains or ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  we elected to retain a portion of our calendar year income and incurred an excise tax of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended september   and  we declared dividends of  and per share  respectively  for total dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
we monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for taxation purposes may occur for the fiscal year 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a return of capital to our common stockholders 
tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on form div after the end of the calendar year 
we intend to continue to make quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
our quarterly dividends  if any  are determined by our board of directors 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a bdc under the act and or due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions at a particular level 

table of contents we may distribute our common stock as a dividend of our taxable income and a shareholder could receive a portion of the dividends declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash 
a shareholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend 
we have not elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so 
recent developments on october   we sold an additional  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share generating gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us  from the underwriters partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares we granted to them in connection with the offering that closed on september  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
as of september   our debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate and variable rate investments including with a libor  or prime floor 
the variable rate loans are usually based on a libor rate and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
variable rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor 
in regards to variable rate instruments with a floor  we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter we benefit from market rates above any such floor 
in contrast  our cost of funds  to the extent it is not fixed  will fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
assuming that the most recent statement of assets and liabilities were to remain constant  and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates may affect net income by more than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds as well as our level of leverage 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates 
during the periods covered by this report  we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
