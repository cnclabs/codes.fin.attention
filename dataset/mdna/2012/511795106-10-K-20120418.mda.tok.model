item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the global industrial protective clothing markets 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over  north american safety and mill supply distributors and end users and distributors internationally 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers  such as integrated oil  utilities  chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as international hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments domestically and internationally  such as municipal fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the military  the department of homeland security and the centers for disease control and state and privately owned utilities and integrated oil companies 
our net sales from continuing operations attributable to customers outside the united states were million and million in fy and fy  respectively 
our american sales of disposables  which had been mainly dupont tyvek  a non woven fabric  declined approximately for the year ended january   which continue a long term declining trend for the last five years 
the company has partially replaced these sales with increased sales of hi visibility clothing domestically and increased international sales of our products  particularly our fire protective apparel 
this decline is a result of at first aggressive pricing from dupont on tyvek garments and then the loss of the tyvek license in july in  dupont ceased selling us tyvek fabric  but rather sold us finished tyvek garments 
thereafter  the disposables segment showed a decrease in gross margins  mainly as a result of changes in the product mix  resulting from reselling finished tyvek garments purchased from dupont 
between  dupont increased our prices of tyvek fabric while engaging in aggressive pricing and rebates to customers designed to encourage them to leave lakeland and go to dupont  the only other source of tyvek in north america 
in  dupont stopped selling us tyvek fabrics and in july notified us that as of september they would stop selling us finished goods with no explanation 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since  in china since  in india since now discontinued and in brazil since may beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we have completed the moving of production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and completed this process by the second quarter of fy as a result  we have seen cost improvements for these particular product lines as well 
our r d expenses are projected to increase in fy to approximately  an increase of  over fy the increase in r d expenses will go in large part toward continuation of existing certifications  development of new products  product certifications necessary to enter markets that we do not currently participate in  and expansion of existing product lines into new markets around the world 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company derives its sales primarily from its limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from its sales of high end chemical protective suits  firefighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped  at which time title and the risk of loss pass to the customer 
some sales in brazil may be sold on terms with fob destination  which are recognized when received by the customer 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts customer creditworthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
past due balances over days and other less creditworthy accounts are reviewed individually for collectability 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based on management s assessment  the company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance 
balances that remain outstanding after the company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
income taxes and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
uncertain tax positions 
the company adopted the guidance for uncertainty in income taxes effective february  this guidance prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under this guidance  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived  intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually  however  these tests may be performed more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by us gaap 
factors that the company considers important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company measures any potential impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires the company s management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
foreign currency risks 
the functional currency for the brazil operation is the brazil real  the united kingdom  the euro  the trading company in china  the renminbi  the canada real estate  the canadian dollar  and the russia operation  the russian ruble and kazakhstan tenge 
all other operations have the us dollar as its functional currency 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth our historical results of continuing operations for the years ended january   and  as a percentage of our net sales from continuing operations 
year ended january  net sales from continuing operations cost of goods sold from continuing operations gross profit from continuing operations operating expenses from continuing operations operating profit from continuing operations interest expense  vat tax charge and other income  net income tax expense benefit from continuing operations net income from continuing operations significant balance sheet fluctuation january   as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million is primarily the result of normal fluctuations in cash management 
the increase in borrowings of million under the term loan agreement and in brazil is principally due to the funding of the capital expansion in brazil and mexico and an increase in inventories in brazil 
trade payables decreased in fy due to our brazilian subsidiary paying down its trade payables to a lower level than the prior year 
also  current liabilities in fy reflected a stock buyback in the amount of million  which was traded on january  but not settled until february year ended january   compared to the year ended january  for the year for the three months ended january  ended january  net sales from continuing operations gross profit from continuing operations operating expenses from continuing operations operating profit loss from continuing operations income loss before tax from continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations net sales 
net sales from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  the net decrease was mainly due to a million decrease in domestic sales  partially offset by a million increase in foreign sales 
the net decrease in the us was comprised mainly of a decrease in us disposables sales  resulting from the loss of the tyvek license from dupont 
this decrease in us sales was offset by significant increases in foreign sales  including million increase in sales of qualytextil  sa in brazil  a million increase in european sales  or  and million growth in combined chile and argentina sales 
external sales from china were flat for the full year but were up in the fourth quarter fy over the fourth quarter fy for purposes of the management s discussion  the reference to q shall mean quarter 
thus q means the second quarter of the applicable fiscal year 
the sales in brazil in q  q and q of this year had no large bid sales  while q last year had large bid sales 
in qfy  operations reflected disposables division year end reversal of rebates accrued earlier in the year due to many customers not meeting their year end targets for rebates 
in qfy  disposables issued a new rebate program which impacted operations in q by approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the major factors driving the changes in gross margins were changes in the mix of foreign vs 
domestic 
foreign sales tend to have much higher margins than us sales 
disposables gross margin decreased by percentage points in fy compared with fy this decrease was mainly due to changes in the product mix with significant reductions in the margins in fy resulting from the resales of dupont products purchased as finished goods from dupont at a much lower margin than sales of dupont products in the prior year largely manufactured by lakeland  partially offset by sales of higher margin lakeland branded products 
disposables margins in q fy were decreased by a revised rebate program in qfy brazil gross margin was for this year compared with last year  resulting from higher margin large bid contracts in the previous year 
reflective margins were higher than the prior year mainly due to higher volume in the current year largely resulting from a contract with a large utility 
canada gross margin increased by percentage points primarily from more favorable exchange rates and local competitive pricing climate 
uk and europe margins increased by percentage points primarily from exchange rate differentials 
argentina margins increased by percentage points largely from higher volume 
operating expenses 
operating expenses from continuing operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january   from for the year ended january  the increase in operating expenses in the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   included million in increased foreign exchange costs  mainly in brazil where we had million in foreign exchange losses in the current year compared with gains of million in the prior year 
million increase in sales travel and trade shows expenses  mainly in canada  russia  the uk and argentina 
million increase in administrative payroll  resulting from a million increase in brazil  offset by a million reduction in canada from severance pay in the prior year and other reductions 
million increase in us sales salaries due to hiring additional sales people in the us million increase in rent  mainly due to new facilities in the uk and sales and warehousing space in brazil 
million increase in r d expenses  resulting from product development 
million increase in bad debt expenses resulting from one account in chile 
million decrease in equity compensation resulting from the cumulative change in the performance level designated by the board of directors  which in turn resulted in a cumulative change for the restricted stock plan in the prior year 
million decrease in medical insurance resulting from several employees with serious illnesses in the prior year 
million freight out decreased  mainly resulting from higher volume and use of air freight and more frequent partial shipments resulting from stock out conditions prevailing during much of fy million reduction in bank charges  mainly from fewer credit card payments from customers 
million in professional fees decreased resulting from the prior year management terminations in brazil 
operating profit 
operating profit from continuing operations decreased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january   from for the year ended january   primarily due to sharply lower volumes and margins in disposables in the us due to the termination of the company s tyvek and tychem supply agreement by dupont  and weak volume in brazil  mainly due to lack of large bid contracts in q interest expense 
interest expense increased by million for the year ended january   compared to the year ended january   because of term loan borrowing in to fund capital expansion in brazil and mexico and also borrowing in brazil at higher rates prevailing in brazil 
other income net 
the decrease in other expenses resulted mainly from the million charge in from vat taxes in brazil in the prior year 
income tax expense 
income tax expenses from continuing operations consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was meaningless for the years ended january  and our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the million vat tax charge in brazil  which did not get a tax benefit and goodwill write off in brazil in the prior year 
our income taxes in the current year were benefited by losses in the us and a check the box us tax benefit from the losses in india at a higher rate than most of the foreign income  a work opportunity credit in the us and goodwill write offs in brazil 
net income 
net income from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  the decrease in net income was primarily a result of reduced operating profit from the us disposables division offset by the million vat tax charge in brazil in the prior year and various tax credits in the current year 
fourth quarter results continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fy  the company sustained a net loss from continuing operations of  this was due to several factors a  charge for shut down of our plant in missouri  startup costs for the new sales office in mexico loss of  on foreign exchange in brazil 
as we have disclosed  we do not hedge in brazil 
we had foreign exchange gains in all of fy and for the first half of fy  reserves for final disposition of inventory of tyvek low volume in disposables for q reflecting a drop of of sales from q last year representing loss in volume of approximately million caused in large part due to the termination of our tyvek and tychem supply agreement with dupont brazil sales in q had no large bids and were down from q last year 
we have received several large bid purchase orders for q into q of fy  so the sales in brazil are expected to be strong in fy due to the low volume in q  some of our china plants had low volume of orders and accepted orders at a loss to keep the plants busy we instituted a revised rebate program in q for our disposables customers in the us resulting in an  additional expense before taxes 
discontinued operations in q fy  the company commenced its efforts to market its property in india 
based on the preliminary results  the company decided it was prudent to take a further markdown of  net of taxes on its assets to reflect market value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  a decrease of million and million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by used in operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash used in continuing operating activities of million for the year ended january   was due primarily to net loss of million  a decrease in receivables of million and decreased payables of million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended january  of million was primarily due to net income of million and an increase in inventories of million  but we paid down our payables by approximately million and our accruals by million 
credit facilities net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to the purchases and improvements to property and equipment in both years and in fiscal mainly due to capital expansions in brazil and mexico 
net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily new borrowings under the term loan facility in fy to fund the brazilian and mexican expansions  borrowings in brazil  and cash used in investing resulted from the repurchase of stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
we currently have one revolving credit facility a million revolving credit facility  of which we had borrowings outstanding as of january  amounting to million  expiring in june  and a million term loan facility expiring june  of which we had million outstanding as of january  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  our credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities  as amended in april see note to the financial statements 
as amended  we had million of availability under this facility as of january  we expect to be borrowing up to million additional in brazil to handle working capital needs 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations  along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility and borrowing in brazil  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of building and equipment in brazil and mexico  manufacturing equipment  computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
we anticipate fy capital expenditures to be approximately million for plant expansion in china to be funded out of current cash in china and approximately million elsewhere 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and  thus  chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
there are no further specific plans for material capital expenditures in the fiscal year contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period total one year or less years years years years after years canada facility loan    term loans td bank    new term loan    borrowings in brazil    operating leases     other liabilities   revolving credit facility   total     the td facility is reflected as amended in april see note to the financial statements included in this form k contingent commitment pursuant to the share purchase agreement relating to the company s purchase of qualytextil  sa in may  there is a provision dealing with a supplementary purchase price  based on a multiple of qualytextil s ebitda in  which is currently in arbitration in brazil 
see further description in note to the financial statements included in this form k 
seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to moderate spring temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between december and may coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
recent accounting developments the company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates asu s 
asu s not listed below were determined to either not be applicable or to have a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance  effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted  requires presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the company chose to early adopt this guidance 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to defer the presentation on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for annual and interim financial statements 
the company chose to defer the implementation of this guidance 
when implemented  this will only affect the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued revised guidance related to the annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance permits companies to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying basis 
if the results of that assessment do not indicate that there is a greater than fifty percent probability that the fair value is less than the carrying basis  no further calculations related to goodwill impairment are required until the next annual evaluation or unless events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value 
as permitted by the fasb  management elected to implement the provisions related to this asu as of january item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which had been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government and  therefore  we have been exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese raw material and component purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in brazil  canada and europe and  to a smaller extent  in other south american countries and dollar denominated payables in brazil 
our sales to customers in brazil are denominated in brazilian reals  in canada in canadian dollars and in europe in euros and british pounds 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  the real  the pound or the euro  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange 
the largest supplier of raw materials to brazil is an american company  and these payables are denominated in us dollars 
if the brazilian real weakened against the us dollar  it would make our costs higher and trigger a loss on foreign exchange on the payables 
our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  however  our sales there were not affected this last year due to a steady exchange rate between the chinese rmb  euro  british pound and the usd 
we did experience some losses between the chinese yuan and the euro  but we have since stepped up our hedging program to include this risk 
we manage the foreign currency risk through the use of rolling day forward contracts against the canadian dollar and chilean peso and through longer term cash flow hedges in china against the usd and euro 
we do not hedge other currencies at this time 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased by approximately million
