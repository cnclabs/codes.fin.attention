item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we returned to profitability in for the first time since the severe downturn of our industry experienced a decline of unprecedented magnitude and is still struggling to return to more normal times 
we are fortunate that the luxury segment of the market  which we serve  appears to be performing better than the market in general 
since the trough  the industry has grown less than while we have experienced growth in carpet sales 
in  we had sales growth in all of our brands which  we believe  further indicates that the upper end business is in the process of recovering from the historic downturn 
our carpet sales increased approximately see reconciliation of net sales to net sales as adjusted below and respectively in the and compared to prior year periods 
although we continue to anticipate a slow recovery in the united states housing sector and new commercial construction  we believe our business is driven more by resale and remodeling of existing homes and commercial facilities 
while our business was more deeply affected by the downturn as it reached the higher end markets where our business is concentrated  we believe our position in the upper end of the markets has permitted us to benefit from improved conditions and grow our sales at a rate that exceeds the rate of growth of the carpet industry 
the positive acceptance of a number of our higher end products and the organizational realignment and cost reduction initiatives we implemented have resulted in more positive operational performance 
debt refinancing on september   we entered into a new five year  secured revolving credit facility the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility provides increased borrowing availability  greater borrowing flexibility and more favorable rates compared with our predecessor senior borrowing arrangement 
additionally  we terminated an existing mortgage loan and entered into a new five year mortgage loan the mortgage loan agreement 
the refinancing of our senior credit facility and the mortgage loan provided borrowing capacity to facilitate the exercise of our option to redeem all of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures pursuant to the provisions of the indenture dated may  the debentures were originally set to mature on may  the details related to our refinancing are more fully discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
facility consolidations and cost reduction plans during the fourth quarter of  in response to the difficult economic conditions  we began consolidating certain manufacturing facilities and operations and made organizational and other changes designed to reduce staff and expenses throughout the company 
all substantive actions associated with this plan were complete by the end of with the exception of ongoing contractual obligations related to a leased facility in california that was part of this initiative 
in may of  the landlord sold the facility to a third party at which time we paid thousand to fulfill our obligations under the lease that was set to expire in december upon settlement of our obligations under the lease  we recorded a gain of thousand reflecting a reduction in our previously accrued estimated net obligations 
including the thousand lease termination gain recognized in the second quarter of  expenses incurred for the consolidation and organizational changes associated with the facilities consolidation and cost reduction plan were million since inception in the third quarter of cost recognized included million of costs to consolidate facilities  million of severance and employee relocation expenses and million of costs associated with the exit of our leased facility in santa ana  california 
these exit costs exclude certain long lived asset impairment charges related to the realignment and are discussed separately below 
in addition to the consolidation plan initiated in  we developed and began implementing a plan in the third quarter of to realign our organizational structure 
under this plan  we combined our three residential carpet units into one business with three distinct brands 
as a result  our residential business is organized much like our commercial carpet business and more like the rest of the industry 
costs related to the organization realignment include severance costs  associate relocation expenses and costs related to the migration of certain computer applications necessary to support the realignment 
the realignment was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of and all costs have been recorded including an expense reduction of thousand in related to previously accrued associate relocation expenses 
total costs incurred under this realignment plan were million 
these actions had a positive impact on our results and we believe have resulted in additional improvements in operational capabilities  increased fixed cost absorption and further facilitated other cost reductions 

table of contents page long lived asset impairments long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of million for long lived asset impairments primarily related to leasehold improvement assets in the california leased facility that  subsequent to the exit of the leased facility  no longer provided future economic benefit to us  other manufacturing related assets that were no longer used as a result of the california facilities consolidation and additional computer software taken out of service in the systems consolidation process 
goodwill impairment under our policy  goodwill was tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated that the carrying value of goodwill associated with a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable see note c of our consolidated financial statements related to our goodwill assessment process 
because economic conditions in the carpet industry deteriorated significantly in the first quarter of  we performed impairment testing of the remaining goodwill associated with our fabrica reporting unit 
the measurement resulted in the impairment of the remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc in  accordingly  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment loss of million in the first quarter of there is no goodwill remaining subsequent to that date 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles 
our second through fourth quarters of and each quarter in contained operating weeks 
our first quarter of contained operating weeks  therefore  contained operating weeks compared with operating weeks in discussions below related to percentage changes in net sales for the annual periods have been adjusted to reflect the comparable number of weeks in the first quarter reporting period and are qualified with the term net sales as adjusted 
we believe net sales as adjusted will assist our financial statement users in understanding the rate of growth in our business in the comparative periods 
see reconciliation of net sales to net sales as adjusted in the table below

we will continue to aggressively pursue inventory management  maintain tight cost controls and limit capital expenditures 
however  deterioration in our markets or significant additional cash expenditures above our normal liquidity requirements could require supplemental financing or other funding sources 
there can be no assurance that such supplemental financing or other sources of funding can be obtained or will be obtained on terms favorable to us

the applicable margin is determined based on availability under the senior credit facility with margins increasing as availability decreases 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  and was at december  under the terminated facility 
we also pay an unused line fee on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed utilization of the senior credit facility equal to per annum

off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  or december  income tax considerations 
during the third quarter of  we agreed upon a settlement of approximately million associated with an internal revenue service audit for the tax years of through the settlement is related to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of those assets  accordingly the settlement resulted in an increase in deferred taxes and had no significant impact on tax expense 
we expect to pay the settlement in the first quarter of excluding the settlement payment  we anticipate cash outlays for income taxes to differ from our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
we anticipate our cash outlay to be below our tax provision in and to exceed our tax provision in and the differences in each of the three years are associated with timing differences between the book basis and tax basis of long lived  depreciable assets 
such differences could be in the range of million in each of the periods  although there are many factors that could alter the actual experience 
at december   we are in a net deferred tax asset position of million 
we performed an analysis  including an evaluation of certain tax planning strategies available to us  related to the net deferred tax asset and believe that the net tax asset is recoverable in future periods  including a thousand federal income tax credit carry forward and federal net operating loss carry forward 
during  we increased our tax valuation reserve related to future benefits for state net operating loss carry forwards by thousand because the underlying tax assets increased 
discontinued operations environmental contingencies 
we have reserves for environmental obligations established at five previously owned sites that were associated with our discontinued textile businesses 
each site has a corrective action plan cap with the applicable authoritative state regulatory body responsible for oversight for environmental compliance 
the cap for four of these sites involves natural attenuation degradation of the contaminants through naturally occurring events over periods estimated at to years and the cap on the remaining site involves a pump and treat remediation process  estimated to occur over a period of to years 
additionally  we have a reserve for an environmental liability on the property of a facility and related business that was sold in the cap has a specified remediation term estimated to be years subsequent to the total costs for remediation for all of these sites was thousand  thousand for normal ongoing remediation costs and thousand for remediation specific to a special initiative in we expect normal remediation costs to approximate thousand annually 
we have a reserve of million for environmental liabilities at these sites as of december  certain related party transactions 
during the fiscal year ended december   we purchased a portion of our requirements for polyester fiber from engineered floors  an entity controlled by robert e 
shaw 
mr 
shaw reported holding approximately of our common stock  which as of year end represented approximately of the total vote of all classes of our common stock 
engineered floors is one of our suppliers of fiber  but is our principal supplier of polyester fiber 
our total purchases from engineered floors for were approximately million  or approximately of all the company s comparable purchases in our purchases from engineered floors are based on market value  negotiated prices 
we have no contractual arrangements or commitments with mr 
shaw associated with our business relationship with engineered floors 
transactions with engineered floors were reviewed and approved by our board as arms length and on terms no less favorable to the company than similar purchases form other fiber suppliers 

table of contents page critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer takes title to products  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
accounts receivable allowances 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  aged or obsolete inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we routinely assess our exposure related to legal matters  environmental matters  product liabilities or any other claims against our assets that may arise in the normal course of business 
if we determine that it is probable a loss has been incurred  the amount of the loss  or an amount within the range of loss  that can be reasonably estimated will be recorded 

table of contents page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates  among other factors 
it is our policy to minimize our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding our company with debt 
we address this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of interest rate swap agreements see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
at december    or approximately of our total debt  was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact of approximately
