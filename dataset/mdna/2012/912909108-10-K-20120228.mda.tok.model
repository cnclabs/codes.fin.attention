many nations have adopted or are considering regulation of carbon dioxide co emissions 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions 
this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken in the future by the current or a new session of congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
such regulations may entail substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production  and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
some foreign nations such as china and india are not aggressively pursuing regulation of co and integrated steel producers in such countries may achieve a competitive advantage over u

blast furnace injection of coal  natural gas and self generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage 
the increase in coke production in was mainly due to the inclusion of production at lake erie works and hamilton works for the entire year following the ussc acquisition in the decrease in coke production in resulted from the temporary idling of cokemaking facilities at the clairton plant  granite city works  hamilton works and lake erie works for part of the year as well as the permanent shut down of three coke batteries at the clairton plant

during  about percent of our natural gas purchases in flat rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors  the remainder was made daily or with term agreements or with fixed price forward physical purchase contracts 
we believe that supplies adequate to meet usse s needs are normally available at competitive market prices  although it experienced a supply curtailment of more than ten days in january related to russia s suspension of natural gas shipments to europe 
since that time  we have taken steps to mitigate the effects of a future disruption including adding storage capacity in the slovak republic and the ability to have reverse flow gas from the czech republic to slovakia 
both flat rolled and usse use self generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas 
industrial gases u

in approximately percent  percent and percent of sales by flat rolled  usse and tubular  respectively  were contract sales 
some contract pricing agreements include fixed price while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components 
u

environmental matters u 
s 
steel maintains a comprehensive environmental policy 
the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of u 
s 
steel officers  meets regularly to review environmental issues and compliance 
both the board of directors and the corporate governance and public policy committee receive regular updates on environmental matters 
the compensation and organization committee has made annual improvement one of four performance measures for short term incentive compensation for our officers 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute  the canadian steel producers association  the world steel and european confederation of iron and steel industries eurofer  is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air  water  waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local  state  national and international levels 
u 
s 
steel s businesses in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in 
table of contents certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
ussc is subject to the environmental laws of canada  which are comparable to environmental standards in the united states 
environmental regulation in canada is an area of shared responsibility between the federal government and the provincial governments  which in turn delegate certain matters to municipal governments 
federal environmental statutes include the federal canadian environmental protection act  and the fisheries act 
various provincial statutes regulate environmental matters such as the release and remediation of hazardous substances  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and air emissions 
as in the united states  canadian environmental laws federal  provincial and local are undergoing revisions and becoming more stringent 
ussk is subject to the environmental laws of slovakia and the eu 
a related law of the eu commonly known as registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals  regulation reach requires the registration of certain substances that are produced in the eu or imported into the eu 
although ussk is currently compliant with reach  this regulation is becoming increasingly stringent 
slovakia is also currently considering a law implementing an eu waste framework directive that would more strictly regulate waste disposal and increase fees for waste disposed of in landfills including privately owned landfills 
the intent of the waste legislation is to encourage recycling and we cannot estimate the full financial impact of this prospective legislation at this time 
the eu s industry emission directive will require implementation of eu determined best available techniques bats to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with bat associated emission levels 
it contains operational requirements for air emissions  waste water discharges  solid waste disposal and energy conservation  dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits 
slovakia is required to adopt the directive by january  and is allowed only very limited discretion in implementing the legislation 
ussk will be required to be in full compliance within four years after the eu publishes the bat standards 
we are currently evaluating the costs of complying with bat  but expect it will involve significant capital expenditures and increased costs 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations which in recent years have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations and similar obligations in europe and canada 
in the future  compliance with carbon dioxide co emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances  restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems 
since it is difficult to predict what requirements will ultimately be imposed in the united states and canada  it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on u 
s 
steel  but it could be substantial 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u 
s 
steel believes that our major north american and many european integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  if the final requirements do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co emissions  our competitive position relative to mini mills will be adversely impacted and our competitive position regarding producers in developing nations  such as china and india  will be harmed unless such nations require comensurate reductions in co emissions 
competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted 
the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
many of our competitors  including north american producers  or their successors  that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such matters 
greenhouse gas emissions regulation the current and potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions remains a significant issue for the steel industry  particularly for integrated steel producers such as u 
s 
steel 
the regulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide co emissions has either become law or is being considered by legislative bodies of many nations  including countries where we have operating facilities 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements as further described below 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate

steel facilities were filed by september  the us epa intends to make this information publicly available from all facilities 
on may  the epa published its final greenhouse gas tailoring rule establishing a mechanism for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from facilities through the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting process 
u 
s 
steel reported its emissions under these rules in accordance with the regulation and its deadlines 
starting january   new projects that increase greenhouse gas emissions by more than  tons per year  have new psd requirements based on best available control technology bact  but only if the project also significantly increases emissions of at least one non greenhouse gas pollutant 
only existing sources with title v permits or new sources obtaining title v permits for non greenhouse gas pollutants will also be required to address greenhouse gas emissions 
starting july  new sources not already subject to title v requirements that emit over  tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions  or modifications to existing permits that increase greenhouse gas emissions by more than  tons per year  will be subject to psd and title v requirements 
on november  the epa issued its psd and title v permitting guidance for greenhouse gases and available and emerging technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the iron and steel industry 
through this guidance  the epa intends to help state and local air permitting authorities identify greenhouse gas reduction options and bact for greenhouse gases under the caa 
u 
s 
steel is currently evaluating the cost of compliance with these regulations 
the european commission ec has created an emissions trading system ets 
under the ets  the ec establishes co emissions limits for every eu member state and approves grants of co emission allowances to individual emitting facilities pursuant to national allocation plans that are proposed by each of the member states 
the allowances can be bought and sold by emitting facilities to cover the quantities of co they emit in their operations 
in july  slovakia granted ussk co emission allowances as part of the national allocation plan for the to trading period nap ii approved by the european commission 
based on actual co emissions to date  we believe that ussk will have sufficient allowances for the nap ii period without purchasing additional allowances 
u 
s 
steel entered into transactions to sell and swap a portion of our emissions allowances and recognized gains related to these transactions of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in december  slovakia enacted an percent tax on excess emission allowances registered in and although ussk believes this tax is unconstitional and unlawful and may contest it  based on the current implementing regulations  u 
s 
steel recorded expense of million for the year ended december  for the period after  the eu s emissions trading scheme ets will employ centralized allocation rather than national allocation plans 
the new ets also includes a cap designed to achieve an overall reduction of greenhouse gases for the ets sectors of in compared to emissions and auctioning as the basic principle for allocating emissions allowances  with some transitional free allocation provided on the basis of benchmarks for manufacturing industries under risk of carbon leakage 
manufacturing of sinter  coke oven products  basic iron and steel  ferro alloys and cast iron tubes have all been recognized as exposing companies to a significant risk of carbon leakage  but the new ets is still expected to lead to additional costs for steel companies in europe 
because we do not know what the market value of co credits will be after  we cannot reliably estimate the cost of complying with the new ets at this time 
in  canada s federal government announced a framework climate change plan that involved mandatory reduction targets for all major greenhouse gas producing industries 
to date  federal greenhouse gas regulations have been adopted for canada s transportation and electricity sectors only 
the federal government has indicated that it is committed to reducing canada s total greenhouse gas emissions by percent from levels by  
table of contents but also stated that this target is subject to adjustment in order to remain aligned with the united states 
at this point  it is unclear when canadian federal regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for other major emitting sectors will be developed and whether they will reflect the targets or approach of the previously announced plan 
on june   canada s federal government also released for comment two draft guides related to the establishment of an offset system in canada 
these draft documents propose rules and provide guidance on the requirements and processes to create offset credits and the requirements and processes to verify the eligible greenhouse gas reductions achieved from an offset project 
canada s federal government has stated that  once in place  the offset system will compliment the proposed cap and trade system and help in generating greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the country 
on december   the government announced that canada was exercising its legal right to formally withdraw from the kyoto protocol 
u 
s 
steel does not know what impact  if any  this action may have on greenhouse gas emission regulations and its canadian operations 
if federal greenhouse gas reduction legislation for the steel sector becomes law in canada  it could have economic and operational consequences for u 
s 
steel 
it is impossible to estimate the timing or impact of these or other future government actions on u 
s 
steel 
in december  the ontario government announced its own action plan on climate change the ontario action plan 
the ontario action plan targets reductions in ontario greenhouse gas emissions of six percent below levels by  percent below levels by and percent below levels by in december  ontario launched a consultation process towards the development of a cap and trade system and in may  the ontario government released a discussion paper regarding cap and trade 
the ontario government has amended the environmental protection act in order to provide the regulatory authority to set up a greenhouse gas cap and trade system  however  such a system has not yet been developed 
the ontario government also passed a greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulation the regulation on december  the regulation is intended to provide the foundation for ontario to implement a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases 
the regulation requires facilities that emit more than  tons of coe or more per year to annually report their emissions  starting with emissions 
the ontario government has stated that it is working with four other canadian provinces and seven us states to design a broad based cap and trade system

air the caa imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions 
the caa requires  among other things  the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
the epa has developed various industry specific mact standards pursuant to this requirement 
the caa requires epa to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of hazardous air pollutants 
epa must also conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to mact standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks 
the principal impact of the mact standards on u 
s 
steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking  ironmaking  steelmaking and iron ore processing 
in addition  the epa is expected to repromulgate boiler mact regulations in  which are expected to impose standards and limitiations for fuels  including possibly coke oven gas  used in boilers and process heaters and their resulting emissions at us steel facilities 
the current boiler mact rule is subject to an administrative stay 
the impact of the anticipated boiler mact rule upon us steel can not be estimated since the new boiler mact rule is not yet finalized 
in september  epa sent us steel s integrated steel facilities information collection requests for information regarding emissions from various iron and steel operations to be used in a new iron and steel mact rule 
the current or existing iron and steel mact rule is subject to a legal challenge by sierra club 
in june  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted epa s motion for voluntary remand of the iron and steel mact 
as a result  while the existing standards are still in effect  epa anticipates promulgating new iron and steel mact rules in response to the challenge by the sierra club 
the impact of the new iron and steel mact cannot be estimated at this time since the epa is just beginning its information collection part of the rulemaking process 

table of contents u 
s 
steel s cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of mact standards 
the first category applies to pushing and quenching 
the epa was required to make a risk based determination for pushing and quenching emissions  but the epa is working on an information request to determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary and expects to issue guidance to coke making facilities early in since the epa has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards from these operations  the impact if any  cannot be estimated at this time 
the second category of mact standards applying to coke facilities applies to emissions from charging  coke oven battery tops and coke oven doors 
with regard to these standards  u 
s 
steel chose to install more stringent controls than mact on some of its batteries  called lowest achievable emissions reductions laer 
such laer batteries are not required to comply with certain residual risk standards until because the scope of these anticipated changes are distant and relatively uncertain  the magnitude of the impact of these anticipated changes cannot be estimated at this time 
u 
s 
steel s iron ore processing operations are subject to the taconite iron ore processing mact standards 
these standards may change if epa revises the mact standards in response to a petition filed by an environmental advocacy group 
epa has yet to publish or propose any revisions to the taconite iron ore processing mact or conduct any residual risk analysis from these operations  therefore  the impact of any possible changes cannot be estimated at this time 
the caa also requires the epa to develop and implement national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria pollutants  which include  among others  particulate matter consisting of pm 
and pm  lead carbon monoxide  nitrogen dioxide  sulfur dioxide  and ozone 
in  epa established hour and annual standards for fine particles that are less than micrometers in size and in  epa tightened the hour standard but retained the annual standard 
these standards were challenged and the us court of appeals for the district of columbia  in american farm bureau federation and national pork producers council et al 
v 
epa  f 
rd dc cir 
 remanded the annual standards to the epa for further consideration but allowed the hour standard to remain in effect 
in october  the epa advised members of congress that it intended to retain the pm 
standard in the anticipated rule making  but indicated that it is still evaluating the latest evidence and assessments with regards to any revisions to the pm standard 
if the pm standards are lowered as expected  us steel could face increased capital  operating and compliance costs related to reductions of pm from affected sources 
states were required to demonstrate compliance with the fine particle standard by april  unless epa granted the state or local jurisdiction an extension 
extensions may be granted through april many states and jurisdictions in which u 
s 
steel operates received a five year extension  requiring that the area demonstrate compliance by april in addition  the annual standard could change based upon the remand noted above 
if the standard is changed  states will be required to modify their state implementation plans sips to meet the new standard 
on december   epa designated areas in which u 
s 
steel operates as nonattainment and unclassified attainment for the fine particle standard 
sips for the hour standard are due december   with attainment demonstrations with the standard expected to be made by or  with extensions 
it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of any costs associated with the sips for the hour standard or the remand of the annual standard since the state and federal agencies are still developing regulations for the programs and implementation for the hour standard 
demonstrating attainment with the hour standard is not expected until sometime between and and no new standard or associated timeline has been established for the annual standard 
effective may  epa lowered its ground level ozone air quality standards  which could affect sources of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds  including coke plants  and iron and steel facilities 
however  in response to a legal challenge of the ground level ozone naaqs  epa proposed to lower the naaqs from what was promulgated in as a result  the court held the legal challenge abeyance 
in july   epa proposed to lower the ozone standard from the current parts per million to a value in the range of parts per million 
while epa stated that it would promulgate a final rule with a lower naaqs for ozone in september  president obama advised epa that his administration did not support the proposed rule and directed epa to withdraw the rule and to reconsider the standard again in as it is compelled to do pursuant to the caa 
as a result  the legal challenge to the standard is no longer in abeyance and is again moving 
table of contents forward 
since epa previously stayed attainment designations  epa also advised the regulated community that it would move forward with implementation of the standard  starting with designating areas in the first half of states must submit sips outlining how they will reduce pollution to meet the standards by a date that is no later than three years after epa s final designations 
if epa issues designations in as it has indicated  these plans would be due no later than states are required to meet the standards by deadlines that may vary based on the severity of the problem in the area 
it is anticipated that the ozone naaqs revisions could result in significant costs to u 
s 
steel  however  it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of these costs at this time since any implementation requirements will not be known until after areas are designated and sips are developed 
in  epa retained the annual nitrogen dioxide naaqs standard  but created a new hour naaqs and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements 
while it is expected that compliance with the new standard could result in additional capital expenditures in the coming years  since epa has not yet made area designations with regards to the new hour naaqs for nitrogen oxide and states have not yet begun preparing implementation plans  the impact on current operations at u 
s 
steel facilities cannot be estimated at this time 
also in  the epa revised the primary sulfur dioxide standard by establishing a new hour standard at a level of parts per billion 
in the rulemaking  the epa also revoked the two previously existing primary standards of parts per billion for hour periods  and the annual standard of parts per billion 
while it is expected that compliance with the new standard could result in additional capital expenditures in the coming years  since the epa has not yet made area designations with regards to the new hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide and states have not yet begun preparing implementation plans  the impact on current operations at u 
s 
steel facilities cannot be estimated at this time

risk factors risk factors related to the difficult economic conditions all segments of our business continue to be impacted by the difficult economic conditions that began with the global economic recession in and such effects have created certain risks and have also affected the other risks set forth below 
u 
s 
steel cannot predict the duration of the difficult economic conditions and the trajectory of the recovery but both will have a significant impact on u 
s 
steel 
u 
s 
steel and its end product markets continue to be impacted by challenging economic conditions 
the global economic recession that began in resulted in significantly lower demand and decreased profitability across all of our segments and major markets 
while the united states and canada have shown an improved  but somewhat uneven recovery  europe remains stagnant with continued economic and financial challenges 
overall  the current demand for steel products is lower when compared to the period prior to the global economic downturn 
while some of our end customer markets supplied by our flat rolled and usse segments  such as automotive  saw modest recoveries during and  others  such as construction  remain severely depressed 
any decrese in oil and gas drilling activity could result in lower customer demand for the products of our tubular segment 
our operating levels and prices may remain at depressed levels until our customers demand increases 
the ongoing eu debt crisis and economic declines in eu markets have affected product demand and prices for usse 
should conditions worsen in these markets  or additional markets suffer similar sovereign debt challenges  product demand and pricing may further deteriorate 
while usse does not directly or indirectly hold any sovereign debt investments  dissolution and replacement of the euro currency and the potential reintroduction of individual eu currencies could further adversely impact usse and expose usse to increased foreign exchange risk 
china and certain other steel markets were affected less by the global recession and rebounded more quickly in some cases to and even beyond levels 
as a result  steel production serving these markets has increased  which has caused prices for iron ore  metallurgical coal and other raw materials to increase 
this development has caused  and will continue to cause  our costs to increase regardless of the state of recovery in our end markets 
u 
s 
steel may face increased risks of customer and supplier defaults 
there is an increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of our customers and suppliers  including their need to increase working capital as their businesses improve 
we believe some of our customers and suppliers may not have sufficient credit available to them  which could delay payments from customers  result in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling  or to be unable to fill  our needs 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity investees are also being affected by ongoing challenging economic conditions 
u 
s 
steel s joint ventures and other equity affiliates are also engaged in the production of steelmaking raw materials and finishing of flat rolled and tubular products 
as such  they face many of the same issues we do 
since these entities are smaller than u 
s 
steel  they may have fewer resources available to them to respond to ongoing challenging economic conditions 

table of contents risk factors concerning the steel industry steel consumption is highly cyclical  and worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry and the availability of alternative products have resulted in intense competition  which may have an adverse effect on profitability and cash flow  especially during periods of economic weakness 
steel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets 
the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess global supply  which has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
as the overall north american economy has recovered  we have experienced shorter business cycles with durations measured in weeks or months rather than the traditional multi year cycles 
this volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with our steel production and customer product demand 
rapidly growing supply in china and other developing economies may grow faster than real demand in those economies  which may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years  steel consumption in china and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by rapidly increasing steel production capability in those countries and published reports state that further capacity increases are likely 
steel production capability  especially in china  now appears to be well in excess of china s home market demand 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any excess chinese supply could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if this excess and subsidized production is exported to other markets 
since the chinese steel industry is largely government owned  it has not been as adversely impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions  and it can make production and sales decisions for non market reasons 
increased imports of steel products into north america and europe could negatively affect steel prices and demand levels and reduce our profitability 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the us steel market in and and percent in foreign competitors may have lower labor costs  and some are owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
imports of tubular products to the united states increased significantly beginning in oil country tubular goods octg imports accounted for a large share of the growth  as they have more than doubled over levels 
imports of octg from china registered the most dramatic increase as they grew from thousand tons in to nearly million tons in the us market experienced a surge in tubular imports in the second half of that resulted in record octg inventories by the end of the year  which affected demand in chinese imports of seamless standard line and pressure pipe increased by more than percent in the three months after the filing of antidumping and countervailing duty petitions in september  as compared to the three months prior to the filing 
imports of flat rolled steel to canada accounted for an estimated percent of the canadian market for flat rolled steel products in  percent in and percent in total imports of flat rolled carbon steel products to the eu the countries currently comprising the eu were percent of the eu market in  percent in and percent in increases in future levels of imported steel to north america and europe could reduce future market prices and demand levels for steel products produced in those markets 
imports into the united states  canada and the eu have often violated the international trade laws of these jurisdictions 
while in some cases u 
s 
steel and others have been successful in obtaining relief under these laws  in other circumstances relief has not been received 
when received  such relief is generally subject to 
table of contents automatic or discretionary recision or reduction 
there can be no assurance that any such relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief as obtained will be adequate 
there is also a risk that international bodies such as the world trade organization or judicial bodies in the united states  canada or the eu may change their interpretations of these laws in ways unfavorable to u 
s 
steel such as a recent united states court ruling rejecting the applicability of countervailing duty laws to non market economies such as china 
limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays  defaults or force majeure events by suppliers  shortages or transportation problems such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or disruption of rail lines  waterways or natural gas transmission lines  resulting in production curtailments 
as a result  we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties 
usse purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources 
usse is also dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in russia and transported through ukraine 
usse experienced natural gas supply curtailments during russia s suspension of natural gas shipments to europe in january  resulting in steel production curtailments  escalated costs and reduced profit margins 
since that time  we have taken steps to mitigate the effects of a future disruption including adding storage capacity in the slovak republic and the ability to have reverse flow gas from the czech republic to slovakia 
any future curtailments and escalated costs may further reduce profit margins 
if we do not complete the ongoing projects to construct new coke batteries and the carbon alloy facility  or if these projects do not produce the anticipated quality or volume of products  we will become increasingly dependent upon purchased coke as some of our existing batteries are approaching the end of their useful lives 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
steel producers in the united states are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the eu  canada and japan are generally comparable to us standards  other nations  particularly china  have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
greenhouse gas policies could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create co this distinguishes integrated steel producers from mini mills and many other industries where co generation is generally linked to energy usage 
in the united states  the environmental protection agency epa has published rules for regulating greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities and has implemented various reporting requirements 
in the last congress  legislation was passed in the house of representatives and introduced in the senate 
we do not know what action  if any  may be taken in the future by the current or a new session of congress 
the eu has established greenhouse gas regulations and canada has published details of a regulatory framework for greenhouse gas emissions 
for a discussion of these  see part i business environmental matters 
we cannot predict the final requirements that may be adopted in the united states and canada  or the form of future actions that may be taken by the eu  however  such limitations could entail substantial costs for emission allowances restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal  natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems  which could have a negative effect on results of operations and cash flows 
since mini mill production does not involve the same chemical reactions as integrated production  mini mills may have a competitive advantage 
also  since china and many other developing nations have not instituted greenhouse gas regulations  and since past international agreements such as the kyoto protocol provided 
table of contents exemptions and lesser standards for developing nations  we may also be at a competitive disadvantage with certain foreign steel producers 
many of our customers in the united states  canada and europe may experience similar impacts  which could result in decreased demand for our products 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations our retiree health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  and our pension plan costs in north america are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering most of our north american employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current employees  retirees and beneficiaries are participating in the plans to receive pension and or medical benefits 
at december   on an accounting basis  u 
s 
steel s retiree medical and life insurance plans were underfunded by billion and our pension plans were underfunded by billion 
most of our employee benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans other than contributions to the steelworkers pension trust spt described below are regulated under erisa and the pension protection act of the ppa 
minimum contributions to u 
s 
steel canada ussc pension plans are governed by an agreement entered into by stelco inc stelco and the province of ontario that u 
s 
steel assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of stelco 
this unique agreement requires ussc to fund annually a c million flat dollar contribution plus special contributions for cost of living adjustments cola indexing and other amendments adopted since for the four main ussc pension plans through after this time  the minimum contribution requirements for ussc s plans are subject to ontario canada provincial rules for funding defined benefit plans which generally require the funding of solvency deficiencies over a five year period and may require significantly more annual contributions than is currently required under a stelco now u 
s 
steel agreement 
the turmoil in financial markets during led to significant declines in the value of equity investments that are held by the trusts under our pension plans and the trust to pay for retiree health care and life insurance benefits 
while some of the losses were recovered in and  poorly performing global equity markets in negatively impacted our underfunded positions at december  additionally  certain corporate bond rates are utilized in determining the discount rate used to measure our pension and other benefit obligations for both us gaap and funding purposes 
the federal reserve board has continued to suppress interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the broader american economy  which has had the direct effect of lowering the bond rates used in the determination of the appropriate discount rate 
a lower discount rate reduces the funded position of these plans 
if there is significant underfunding of the liabilities in our defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel  may be required or may choose to make substantial contributions to these plans  which may divert committed capital to satisfy funding requirements related to these obligations and delay or cancel projects that we believe would increase our ability to meet our customers needs as well as our profitability 
u 
s 
steel contributes to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan domestically for usw represented employees formerly employed by national steel and represented employees hired after may called the steelworkers pension trust spt 
we have legal requirements for future funding of this plan should the spt become significantly underfunded or we decide to withdraw from the plan 
either of these scenarios may negatively impact our future cash flows 
the collective bargaining agreements with the usw entered into effective september  the cbas increased our required contributions to this plan from to per hour for most steelworker employees 
collectively bargained company contributions to the plan could increase as a result of future changes agreed to by the company and the usw 
despite the global recession  domestic health care costs continue to increase each year  and could accelerate due to inflationary pressures on the overall health care trend rates 
these pressures may in part stem from requirements legislated by the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in this may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents many domestic and international competitors do not provide retiree health care and life insurance or defined benefit pension plans  and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored retirement and health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
benefit obligations under our plans are not tied to operating rates  therefore  our costs do not change to reflect general economic conditions 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our results of operations and cash flows 
u 
s 
steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
for example  we recorded a charge of million in related to a component of the gary works rcra corrective action program  and we recorded a charge of million in in connection with the expanded scope of remediation at our former geneva works 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
many us competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
competitors that have obtained relief under bankruptcy laws may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters  hot strip mills and various structures and operations that support them 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers 
for example  we experienced a structural failure at gary works in that disrupted operations for several weeks 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
we are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future 
production at usse was curtailed in january due to the suspension of natural gas deliveries to europe from russia transported through ukraine and we remain vulnerable to this risk 
since that time  we have taken steps to mitigate the effects of a future disruption including adding storage capacity in the slovak republic and the ability to have reverse flow gas from the czech republic to slovakia 
availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions such as shortages of barges  ocean vessels  rail cars or trucks  or unavailability of rail lines or of locks on the great lakes or other bodies of water 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in prices for raw materials  energy  and steel 
in  approximately percent of u 
s 
steel s flat rolled segment sales in the united states are based on sales contracts with volume commitments and durations of at least one quarter  while lesser percentages of tubular and usse segment sales are made pursuant to such contracts 
these contracts generally have a fixed price or a price that will fluctuate with changes in a defined index and do not always have firm volume commitments 
during periods of rapid escalation of raw materials  energy and other costs such as was experienced in  u 
s 
steel may not be able to recover these cost increases from customers with existing fixed price agreements 
conversely  some purchase contracts require annual commitments  or we may elect to make multi year commitments  and in periods of rapid decline  such as  u 
s 
steel may be faced with having agreed to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that are above the then current market price or in greater volumes than required 
if steel prices decline  our profit margins on market based indexed contracts and spot business will be reduced 

table of contents declines in the production levels of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
we sell to the automotive  service center  converter  energy and appliance and construction related industries  all of which have been signficantly impacted by the ongoing difficult economic conditions 
low demand from customers in these key markets may adversely affect our results of operations 
we face risks concerning new technologies  products and increasing customer requirements 
technologies such as direct iron reduction and carbon substitution may be more cost effective than our current production methods 
however  we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies and may from time to time  incur cost over runs and difficulties adapting and fully integrating these technologies into our existing operations 
we may also encounter control or production restrictions  or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations to our current production processes 
customers such as the automotive industry are demanding stronger and lighter products 
tubular customers are increasingly requesting pipe producers to supply connections and other ancillary parts as well as inspection and other services 
we may not be successful in meeting these technological challenges and there may be increased liability exposures connected with the supply of additional products and services 
events such as well failures  line pipe leaks  blowouts  bursts  fires and product recalls could result in claims that our products or services were defective and caused death  personal injury  property damage or environmental pollution 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate  available to protect us in the event of a claim  or its coverage may be limited  canceled or otherwise terminated  or the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on our enterprise value after a loss 
the terms of our indebtedness contain provisions that may limit our flexibility 
the amended credit agreement is secured by a lien on a majority of our domestic inventory and certain of our accounts receivable and includes a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that applies to the most recent four consecutive quarters when availability under the amended credit agreement is less than the greater of of the total aggregrate commitments and million 
because the amended credit agreement was undrawn throughout  this covenant was not applicable 
the value or levels of inventory may decrease or we may not be able to meet this covenant in the future  and either or both of these situations would limit our ability to borrow under the amended credit agreement 
we also amended our rpa during to increase the maximum amount of receivables eligible for sale by million to million 
as of december   we have sold million of our receivables to third party commercial paper conduits to fund our working capital requirements 
reductions in accounts receivable would reduce the amount of receivables available for sale 
in general  availability under the amended credit agreement is limited to a monthly borrowing base for certain eligible domestic inventory 
inventory reductions could limit availability to less than the potential million 
if availability under the amended credit agreement is less than the greater of of the total aggregate commitments and million  we would also be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
in addition  beginning on february  and extending until the repayment or conversion of the senior convertible notes  we must maintain minimum liquidity of at least million if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the senior convertible notes is million or greater  or minimum liquidity of million  if the outstanding principal amount is lower than million 
the minimum liquidity as further defined in the amended credit agreement must include at least million of availability under the amended credit agreement 
this may be a particular problem as market conditions and order levels continue to improve and u 
s 
steel needs the liquidity to build working capital 
we have granted the lenders under the amended credit agreement a secured position in our most liquid assets  which may be a detriment to other creditors 
the amended credit agreement  our senior convertible notes issued in and our billion of senior notes issued in and also contain covenants limiting our ability to create liens and engage in sale leasebacks 
additionally  the repayment of amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement and repurchase of the senior convertible notes and senior notes is required upon a change of control under specified circumstances  as well as other customary provisions 
the amended credit agreement  the senior convertible notes and the rpa have provisions that certain defaults under a material debt obligation could cause a default under the amended credit agreement or the senior convertible notes or termination of the rpa 
these terms may affect our liquidity  our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 

table of contents rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult  may increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings  may affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 
change in control clauses in our financial and labor agreements grant the other parties to those agreements rights to accelerate obligations and to terminate or extend our labor agreements 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  amended credit agreement  senior convertible notes and various other contracts and leases  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately repurchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
additionally  the cbas give the usw the right to either terminate or extend the collective bargaining agreements for an additional four years 
among other things  these provisions may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
a change of control is generally defined to include any of the following a the acquisition by a person or group of at least percent of our common stock  b a merger in which holders of our common stock own less than a majority of the equity in the resulting entity  or c replacement of a majority of the members of our board of directors by persons who were not nominated by our current directors 
our operations expose us to uncertainties and risks in the countries in which we operate  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our us operations are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the united states  which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  inflation  increased regulation  limitations on exports of energy and raw materials  and trade remedies 
actions taken by the us government could affect our results of operations and cash flow 
ussk  located in slovakia and ussc  located in canada  constitute percent of our global raw steel production capability 
both of them are subject to economic conditions and political factors in the countries in which they are located  and ussk is additionally subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the eu and the euro currency 
changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  government instability  civil unrest  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
any future foreign acquisitions or expansions could expose us to similar risks 
we are subject to significant foreign currency risks  which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows 
our foreign operations accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in the financial condition and results of operations of ussk and ussc are reported in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the appreciation of the us dollar against these foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  international cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans  creating intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved  which can have a non cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period 
a billion us dollar denominated intercompany loan from a us subsidiary to a european subsidiary was the primary exposure at december  if the eu abandons the euro  or if one or more members withdraw  the re introduction of individual currencies  would expose us to foreign exchange rate risks for each currency 

table of contents any future foreign acquisitions or expansions may increase such risks 
our business requires substantial expenditures for debt service  obligations  capital investment  operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund 
with billion of long term debt outstanding as of december   we have significant debt service requirements 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
at december   our contractual commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  steelmaking and steel finishing facilities 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million and contractual purchase commitments  including take or pay arrangements  totalling approximately billion 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient  to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund capital expenditures and other liquidity needs 
the limitations under our amended credit agreement and rpa  described above  may limit our availability to draw upon these facilities 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states  however  if we need to repatriate funds in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs  the tax consequences would reduce income and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
our insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insured retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
most hourly employees of u

steel s flat rolled  tubular  cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the united states are covered by the cbas  which expire on september  these agreements contain provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the usw  grant the usw a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the cbas  require us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities and require mandatory pre funding of a trust for retiree health care and life insurance 
these agreements also restrict our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further require that the ratio of non usw employees to usw employees at our domestic facilities not exceed one to five 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the usw  non union producers are not subject to such requirements 
in europe  most represented employees at ussk are represented by the oz metalurg union and are covered by an agreement that expires in march we are at risk of labor stoppages 
our collective bargaining agreements covering most of our domestic employees expire september  and our ussk labor agreement expires in march we are at risk for work stoppages thereafter or if unauthorized job actions occur 

table of contents we are exposed to potential impairment of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
our acquisitions of lone star technologies  inc lone star and stelco  inc stelco created goodwill on our balance sheet which totaled billion as of december   and which exposes us to the risk of future impairment charges 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco and lone star acquisitions in and our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined based on consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or compound annual growth rate  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
the assumptions used will have a large impact on the conclusions reached in future tests 
as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by approximately billion and million  respectively 
there are risks associated with future acquisitions 
the success of any future acquisitions will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms  to finance such acquisitions and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
our acquisitions in involved purchase prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our acquisitions in such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
antitrust and other laws in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from completing acquisitions 
future acquisitions may result in additional goodwill 
there are risks associated with existing and potential accounting and tax requirements 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for pre tax losses in jurisdictions where we have recorded a full valuation allowance for accounting purposes 
as a result  the pre tax losses associated with ussc do not provide any tax benefit for accounting purposes 
significant changes in the mix of pre tax results among the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
similarly  our use of intercompany loans has and in the future may have significant impacts on our financial statements as a result of foreign currency accounting remeasurement effects 
potential future accounting changes could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
even if the impacts are non cash they may materially impact perceptions and judgments about us by rating agencies and investors 
changes in tax law could also negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we may be subject to litigation  the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period 
our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future

if we are unable to hire sufficient qualified replacements for those leaving  our future performance may be adversely impacted 
with respect to our represented employees  we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retired or obtained other employment during the time they were laid off or subject to a work stoppage 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning erp system 
we continue to deploy an erp system at our various locations to help us operate more efficiently 
this is a complex project  which is expected to be implemented in several phases over the next few years 
we may not be able to successfully implement the erp program without experiencing difficulties 
in addition  the expected benefits of implementing the erp system  such as increased productivity and operating efficiencies  may not be fully realized or the costs of implementation may outweigh the realized benefits 
we modified the implementation schedule in early to reduce near term costs 
this action will delay the realization of benefits from this project and may add to final project costs

steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
certain of these matters are included below in this discussion 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the financial statements 
however  management believes that u

steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably 
general litigation in a series of lawsuits filed in federal court in the northern district of illinois beginning september   individual direct or indirect buyers of steel products have asserted that eight steel manufacturers  including u

the cases are filed as class actions and claim treble damages for the period to present  but do not allege any damage amounts 
u

as of december   u 
s 
steel was a defendant in approximately active cases involving approximately  plaintiffs 
during  settlements and dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately claims and u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
new filings added approximately claims 

table of contents about  or approximately percent  of these claims are currently pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
most of the claims filed in  and involve individual or small groups of claimants 
historically  these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel  and claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of former operations of u 
s 
steel 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises and the plaintiff s exposure to other sources of asbestos 
in general  the only insurance available to u 
s 
steel with respect to asbestos claims is excess casualty insurance  which has multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has received minimal payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises  however  with the decline in mass plaintiff cases the incidence of claimants actually alleging a claim against u 
s 
steel is increasing 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or our products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
historically  approximately percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to  u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing our potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where we believe litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
the following table shows activity with respect to asbestos litigation year ended december  opening number of claims claims dismissed  settled and resolved new claims closing number of claims amounts paid to resolve claims in millions the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
the vast majority of pending claims against us allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s 
table of contents current or former premises 
these claims may be made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers

steel settings  the relative periods of exposure between u 
s 
steel and non u 
s 
steel settings vary with each claimant  and the strength or weakness of the causal link between u 
s 
steel exposure and any injury vary widely as do the nature and severity of the injury claimed 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  although the resolution of such matters could significantly impact results of operations for a particular period 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are the generally declining trend in the number of claims  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals 
the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements

environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of  environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites where liability is not resolved 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cercla cleanup and remediation costs will be less than  for sites  between  and million for sites  between million and million for sites and over million for site 
one site is known as the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pennsylvania 
in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources placed the site on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel is essentially complete with the remedial action at this site 
the other site is the former duluth works  which was listed by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca under the 
table of contents minnesota environmental response and liability act on its permanent list of priorities 
the us environmental protection agency epa has included the duluth works site with the st 
louis river interlake duluth tar site on epa s national priorities list 
the duluth works cleanup has proceeded since u 
s 
steel has prepared a conceptual habitat enhancement plan hep that includes measures to address contaminated sediments in the st 
louis river estuary 
mpca on behalf of epa has completed its second five year review for the site 
as a result  additional data collection will be required to address data gaps identified in the five year review and corrective measures will be required to address the recently discovered areas of contamination on the upland property 
study  investigation and oversight costs along with implementation of corrective measures on the upland property and implementation of the hep are currently estimated at million 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million per site 
as described below  costs for remediation  investigation  restoration or compensation are estimated to be in excess of million per site at sites 
potential costs associated with remediation at the remaining sites are not presently determinable 
gary works on march  the epa notified u

steel are general economic conditions in north america  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other benefits costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc  tin and other metallic additions and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
following several years of strong performance  the steel industry and u 
s 
steel were quickly and severely impacted in the latter part of by the global recession 
in response to these economic conditions  our strategy has been to enhance or maintain our liquidity  maintain a solid capital structure  focus capital investments on key projects of long term strategic importance and position ourselves for success in the longer term 
we continue to monitor the impact of the economic situation on our customers and to adjust our operations to efficiently meet their requirements 
our raw steel capability utilization rate in was for flat rolled operations and for usse operations 
excluding usss  the raw steel capability utilization rate was for usse 
on january   u 
s 
steel sold usss to the republic of serbia for a purchase price of one dollar 
in addition  ussk received a million payment for certain intercompany balances owed by usss for raw materials and support services 
u 
s 
steel expects to record a total non cash charge of approximately million in the first quarter of  which includes the loss on the sale and a charge of approximately million to recognize the cumulative currency translation adjustment related to usss 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to earn a competitive return on capital employed by implementing our strategy to be a world leader in safety and environmental performance  to continue to increase our value added product mix  to further expand our global business platform  to maintain a strong capital structure and liquidity position  to continue to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to employee benefits liabilities and assets held in trust relating to such liabilities  the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations and potential litigation claims and settlements 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  current business and market conditions  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
lifo last in  first out is the predominant method of inventory costing for inventories in the united states and fifo first in  first out is the predominant method used in canada and europe 
the lifo method of inventory costing was used for percent and percent of consolidated inventories at december  and december   respectively 
changes in us gaap rules or tax law  such as the elimination of the lifo method of accounting for inventories  could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
equity method investments investments in entities over which u 
s 
steel has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at u 
s 
steel s share of net assets plus loans  advances and our share of earnings less distributions 
differences in the basis of the investment and the underlying net asset value of the investee  if any  are amortized into earnings over the remaining useful life of the associated assets 
income from investees includes u 
s 
steel s share of income from equity method investments  which is generally recorded a month in arrears  except for significant and unusual items which are recorded in the period of occurrence 
gains or losses from changes in ownership of unconsolidated investees are recognized in the period of change 
intercompany profits and losses on transactions with equity investees have been eliminated in consolidation subject to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
u 
s 
steel evaluates impairment of its equity method investments whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value below carrying value is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  we would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value  which then becomes its new carrying value 
pensions and other benefits the recording of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pensions and other benefits is based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 

table of contents u 
s 
steel s investment strategy for its us pension and other benefits plan assets provides for a diversified mix of public equities  high quality bonds and selected smaller investments in private equities  investment trusts  timber and mineral interests 
for its us pension and other benefit plans  u 
s 
steel has a target allocation for plan assets of percent and percent in equities  respectively  with the balance primarily invested in corporate bonds  treasury bonds and government backed mortgages 
u 
s 
steel believes that returns on equities over the long term will be higher than returns from fixed income securities as actual historical returns from u 
s 
steel s trusts have shown 
returns on bonds tend to offset some of the shorter term volatility of stocks 
both equity and fixed income investments are made across a broad range of industries and companies to provide protection against the impact of volatility in any single industry as well as company specific developments 
u 
s 
steel will use a percent assumed rate of return on assets for the development of net periodic cost for the main defined benefit pension plan and domestic opeb plans in this assumed rate of return reflects a decline from the percent used for domestic expense and was determined by taking into account the intended asset mix and some moderation of the historical premiums that fixed income and equity investments have yielded above government bonds 
actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this percent rate and while some recent annual returns have not  it is u 
s 
steel s expectation that rates will return to this level in future periods 
for ussc defined benefit pension plans  u 
s 
steel s investment strategy is similar to its strategy for us plans  whereby the company seeks a diversified mix of large and mid cap equities  high quality corporate and government bonds and selected smaller investments with a target allocation for plan assets of percent equities 
u 
s 
steel will use a percent assumed rate of return on assets for the development of net periodic costs for the ussc defined benefit expense in this is lower than the us pension plan assumption as subcategories within the asset mix are from a more limited investment universe and  as a result  have a lower expected return 
the assumed rate of return reflects a decline from the percent used for ussc expense 
to determine the discount rate used to measure our pension and other benefit obligations  certain corporate bond rates are utilized for both us gaap and funding purposes 
as a result of lower interest rates at december  and the continued volatility in the financial markets  u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate used to measure both domestic pension and other benefits obligations to percent from percent 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which we estimate the pension and other benefits liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting the domestic rates  we utilize several aaa and aa corporate bond rates as an indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also consider an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
for canadian benefit plans  a discount rate was selected through a similar review process using canadian bond rates and indices and at december   u 
s 
steel decreased the discount rate to percent from percent for its canadian based pension and other benefits 
u 
s 
steel reviews its own actual historical rate experience and expectations of future health care trends to determine the escalation of per capita health care costs under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
about two thirds of our costs for the domestic united steelworkers usw participants retiree health benefits in the company s main domestic insurance plan are limited to a per capita dollar maximum calculation based on base year actual costs incurred under the main u 
s 
steel insurance plan for usw participants the cost cap that was negotiated in the effective date of the cost cap was deferred under the collective bargaining agreement cba until after  the company s costs for a majority of usw retirees and their beneficiaries are expected to remain fixed with the application of the cost cap and as a result  the cost impact of health care escalation on the company is projected to be limited for this group see footnote to the financial statements 
for measurement of its domestic retiree medical plans where health care cost escalation is applicable  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
for measurement of its canadian retiree medical plans  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  including multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in compared to million in the decrease in expected expense in is primarily a result of the natural maturation of our pension plans whereby benefit payments paid out to retirees exceed the amount of new 
table of contents unfunded liabilities generated and a higher market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior year deferred gains partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate and expected rate of return year over year 
total other benefits costs in are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in the decrease in expected expense in is primarily a result of medicare program changes related to the adoption of the new employer group waiver plan structure  elimination of most non union medicare coverage  the natural maturation of the plans and favorable claims cost experience in a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percentage point change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and other benefits calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension costs for discount rate incremental increase decrease in net periodic pension other benefits costs for pension other benefits liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in service and interest costs components changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for accounting purposes do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
however  the discount rates required for minimum funding purposes are also based on corporate bond related indices and as such  the same general sensitivity concepts as above can be applied to increases or decreases to the funding obligations of the plans assuming the same hypothetical rate changes 
for further cash flow discussion see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed from businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we have two reporting units that have a significant amount of goodwill 
our flat rolled reporting unit was allocated goodwill from the stelco  inc stelco and lone star technologies  inc 
lone star acquisitions in these amounts reflect the benefits we expect the flat rolled reporting unit to realize from expanding our flexibility in meeting our customers needs and running our flat rolled facilities at higher operating rates to source our semi finished product needs 
our texas operations reporting unit  which is part of our tubular operating segment  was allocated goodwill from the lone star acquisition  reflecting the benefits we expect the reporting unit to realize from the expansion of our tubular operations 
u 
s 
steel completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for either reporting unit 
fair value was determined in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic on fair value  which requires consideration of the income  market and cost approaches as applicable 
for the annual goodwill impairment test  u 
s 
steel used fair values estimated under the income approach and the market approach 
u 
s 
steel did not utilize the cost approach as relevant data was not available 
the income approach is based upon projected future cash flows discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the future cash flows 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas 
table of contents operations reporting units was estimated using probability weighted scenarios of future cash flow projections based on management s long range estimates of market conditions over a multiple year horizon 
a three percent perpetual growth rate was used to arrive at an estimated future terminal value 
a discount rate of percent was used for both reporting units which was based upon the cost of capital of other comparable steel companies  which we view as the most likely market participants  as of the date of our goodwill impairment test 
the market approach is based upon an analysis of valuation metrics for companies comparable to our reporting units 
fair value for the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units was estimated using an appropriate valuation multiple based on this analysis  estimated normalized earnings and an estimated control premium 
in order to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization  using a reasonable control premium  was performed as of the valuation date 
we further validated the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units using other valuation metrics that included data from u 
s 
steel s historical transactions as well as published industry analyst reports 
as of december   the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units have million and million of goodwill  respectively 
after weighting the income and market approaches  the annual goodwill impairment test showed that the estimated fair values of our flat rolled and texas operations reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  a critical assumption in which even a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  would decrease the fair value of the flat rolled and texas operations reporting units by approximately billion and million  respectively  but would still not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit under the income approach are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
if business conditions deteriorate or other factors have an adverse effect on our estimates of discounted future cash flows or assumed growth rates  or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization  future tests of goodwill impairment may result in an impairment charge 
u 
s 
steel has determined that certain acquired intangible assets have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets u 
s 
steel evaluates long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows 
we evaluate the impairment of long lived assets at the asset group level 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we evaluated the usse asset group s long lived assets for impairment because the potential disposition of usss was considered a triggering event 
although we expect to record a loss of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result of the sale of usss on january  this transaction did not meet held for sale criteria at december   the fixed asset impairment evaluations did not indicate an impairment at december  since we test the fixed assets at the asset group level  which was usse at that date 
usse consisted of both ussk and usss and the estimated fair value of the usse asset group exceeded its carrying value and resulted in no impairment of fixed assets at the usse asset group level at december  taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for both our canadian and serbian deferred tax assets primarily due to cumulative losses in these jurisdictions in recent years 
accordingly  losses in canada and serbia do not generate a tax benefit for accounting purposes 
in the event that u 
s 
steel determines that it would 
table of contents be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets 
on january   u 
s 
steel sold usss and the serbian deferred tax assets and offsetting valuation allowance will be removed in the first quarter of in connection with the sale 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings because as of december   it remained management s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss for items that have been or may be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  court case  tax ruling or other authoritative tax position  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   the total accrual for environmental remediation was million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
due to uncertainties inherent in remediation projects  it is possible that total remediation costs for active matters may exceed the accrued liability by as much as to percent

the net domestic deferred tax asset was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in the net deferred tax asset from to was primarily due to an increase in credit carryforwards and the change in the funded status of our pension and other employee benefit plans see note to the financial statements 
a substantial amount of u 
s 
steel s domestic deferred tax assets relates to employee benefits that will become deductible for tax purposes over an extended period of time as cash contributions are made to employee benefit plans and retiree benefits are paid in the future 
as a result of our cumulative historical earnings and available tax planning strategies  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   the foreign deferred tax assets recorded were million  net of established valuation allowances of  million 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the euro  the canadian dollar and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for both the canadian and serbian deferred tax assets primarily due to cumulative losses in these jurisdictions in recent years 
if evidence changes and it becomes more likely than not that the company will realize the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance of million for canadian deferred tax assets and million for serbian deferred tax assets as of december   would be partially or fully reversed 
any reversals of these amounts would result in a decrease to tax expense

s 
steel s contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment at december   totaled million 
capital expenditures for are expected to total approximately million 
with regard to capital investments  we remain focused on a number of key projects of strategic importance in each of our three business segments 
we have made significant progress to improve our self sufficiency and reduce our reliance on coke for the steel making process through the application of advanced technologies  upgrades to our existing coke facilities and increased use of natural gas and pulverized coal in our operations 
this may enable us to minimize additional capital investments in coke and carbon alloy projects in the future 
engineering and construction of a technologically and environmentally advanced battery at the mon valley works clairton plant with projected capacity of  tons per year is underway with completion expected near year end we are constructing a carbon alloy facility at our gary works which utilizes an environmentally compliant  energy efficient and flexible production technology to produce a coke substitute with a projected capacity of  tons per year with completion expected in the second half of we expect both of these projects to reach full production capability in we completed construction of our blast furnace coal injection facilities in europe 
the facilities became operational during the fourth quarter of and provide our european blast furnaces access to pulverized coal  traditionally a lower cost source of carbon than coke 
we continue to pursue the use of natural gas in our operations  primarily in north america  given the significant cost and environmental advantages of this fuel 
these projects tend to be smaller projects with limited capital cost 
in order to more efficiently serve our tubular product customers increased focus on north american shale resources  the construction of an additional quench and temper line was completed during the third quarter of along with the installation of a hydrotester  threading and coupling and inspection stations at our lorain tubular operations in ohio 
in an effort to increase our participation in the automotive market as vehicle emission and safety requirements become more stringent  pro tec coating company  our joint venture in ohio with kobe steel  ltd  has a new automotive continuous annealing line under construction that is being financed at the joint venture level and is expected to reach full production by the end of we are also continuing our efforts to implement an erp system to replace outdated systems and to help us operate more efficiently 
the completion of the erp project is expected to provide further opportunities to streamline  standardize and centralize business processes in order to maximize cost effectiveness  efficiency and control across our global operations 
over the longer term  we are considering business strategies to leverage our significant iron ore position in the united states  and to exploit opportunities related to the availability of reasonably priced natural gas as an alternative to coke in the iron reduction process to improve our cost competitiveness  while reducing our dependence on coal and coke 
we are considering an expansion of our iron ore pellet operations at our keewatin  mn keetac facility  which would increase our production capability by approximately million tons thereby increasing our iron ore self sufficiency 
the total cost of this project as currently conceived is broadly estimated to be approximately million and final permitting for the expansion was completed in december we also are examining alternative iron and steelmaking technologies such as gas based  direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace eaf steelmaking 
our capital investments in the future may reflect such strategies  although we expect that iron and steel making through the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace manufacturing processes will remain our primary processing technology for the long term 
the foregoing statements regarding expected capital expenditures  capital projects and expected benefits from the implementation of the erp project are forward looking statements 
factors that may affect our capital spending and the projects include i levels of cash flow from operations  ii changes in tax laws  iii general economic conditions  iv steel industry conditions  v cost and availability of capital  vi receipt of necessary permits  and vii unforeseen hazards such as contractor performance  material shortages  weather conditions  explosions or fires 
there is also a risk that the completed projects will not produce at the expected levels and within the costs currently projected 
predictions regarding benefits resulting from the implementation of the erp project are subject to uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements
