item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own  manage  and finance a portfolio of real estate related assets  including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations or cmos  agency callable debentures  and other securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our interest earning assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of interest earning assets and from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries offer diversified real estate  asset management and other financial services 
fidac and merganser are our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries that are registered investment advisors that generate advisory and service fee income 
rcap is our wholly owned broker dealer taxable reit subsidiary which generates fee income 
we also own subsidiaries engaged in corporate middle market lending transactions  providing warehouse financing to residential mortgage originators  providing advice on commercial real estate transactions  including sale leaseback and single tenant net leased properties across europe  and investing in trading securities 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  cmos and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae 
we also invest in federal home loan bank or fhlb  freddie mac and fannie mae debentures 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to high quality rated mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation or s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
in addition  we may directly or indirectly invest part of this remaining of our assets in other types of securities  including without limitation  unrated debt  equity or derivative securities  to the extent consistent with our reit qualification requirements 
the derivative securities in which we invest may include securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  as well as inverse floaters  which may have imbedded leverage as part of their structural characteristics 
we may acquire agency mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  substantially all of the agency mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining our status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future

economic interest expense includes interest expense on interest rate swaps 
economic net interest income includes interest expense on interest rate swaps the following table presents the cpr experienced on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  for the purpose of calculating average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  daily balances are used 
for the purposes of computing ratios relating to equity measures  throughout this report  equity includes series b preferred stock  which has been treated under gaap as temporary equity 
for the purpose of computing net interest income and ratios relating to cost of fund measures throughout this report  interest expense includes interest expense on interest rate swaps  which is classified in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as realized losses on interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps are used to hedge the increase in interest expense on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment 
presenting the contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities reflects total contractual interest payments 
this presentation depicts the economic value of our investment strategy 
interest expense  including interest payments on interest rate swaps  is referred to as economic interest expense 
net interest income  including interest payments on interest rate swaps  is referred to as economic net interest income

we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
valuation of financial instruments agency mortgage backed securities and debentures there is an active market for agency mortgage backed securities and debentures 
since we primarily invest in securities that can be measured from actively quoted prices  there is a high degree of observable inputs and less subjectivity measuring fair value 
internal market values are determined using quoted prices from the tba market  the treasury curve  and the underlying characteristics of the individual securities  which may include coupon  periodic and life caps  reset dates  and the expected life of the security 
all internal market values are compared to external sources or dealer quotes to determine reasonableness 
additionally  securities used as collateral for repurchase agreements are priced daily by counterparties to ensure sufficient collateralization  providing additional verification of our internal pricing 
interest rate swaps we use the overnight indexed swap ois curve as an input to value substantially all of our interest rate swaps 
we believe using the ois curve  which reflects the interest rate typically paid on cash collateral  more accurately reflects the fair value of interest rate swaps 
consistent with market practice  we have individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the interest rate swaps 
through this margining process  one party or each party to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required  providing additional verification of our recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps 
revenue recognition interest income on agency mortgage backed securities and debentures is recognized over the projected life of the securities using the interest method 
the projected life of the securities is determined based on expected prepayment speeds  past prepayment history of the security  government initiatives that would affect the agency mortgage backed securities market  and market consensus 
gains or losses on investment securities are recorded on trade date based on the average cost of the security 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the internal revenue code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income  if any  to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will then be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for us federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the internal revenue service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distributions to stockholders 
however  we believe that we will be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit and we intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner so that we will qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
we may  however  be subject to certain state and local taxes and our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local taxes 
exposure to european financial counterparties a significant portion of our agency mortgage backed securities are financed with repurchase agreements 
we secure our borrowings under these agreements by pledging our agency mortgage backed securities as collateral to the lender 
the collateral we pledge exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement  typically with the extent of over collateralization being at least of the amount borrowed 
if the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged assets  we are at risk of losing the over collateralized amount 
the amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral 
we also use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risks 
under these swap agreements  we pledge agency mortgage backed securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement for interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position 
if a counterparty were to default on its obligation  we would be exposed to a loss to a swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of our agency mortgage backed securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral 
over the past several years  several large european financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large european banks or institutions 
some of these financial institutions or their us subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions 
we have entered into repurchase agreements and or interest rate swaps with financial institution counterparties that are either domiciled in europe or a us based subsidiary of a european domiciled financial institution 
the following table summarizes our exposure to such counterparties at december  country number of counterparties repurchase agreement financing interest rate swaps at fair value exposure exposure as a percentage of total assets dollars in thousands france germany netherlands switzerland united kingdom total represents the amount of cash and or securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrelated loss on swaps for each counterparty 
at december   we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above 
if the european credit crisis continues to impact these major european financial institutions  it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their us subsidiaries 
our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events 
we monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis  using various methods  including review of recent rating agency actions  financial relief plans  credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties 
we make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps  or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary

these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
all of our agency mortgage backed securities and debentures are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity 
at december  and december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and  respectively  including the effect of the interest rate swaps and convertible senior notes  and the weighted average maturity was days and days  respectively 
during the year ended december   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due or the convertible senior notes for net proceeds following underwriting expenses of approximately million 
interest on the convertible senior notes is paid semi annually at a rate of per year and the convertible senior notes will mature on february  unless earlier repurchased or converted 
the convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate and conversion rate at december  of and shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  which was equivalent to an initial conversion price and conversion price at december  of and per share of common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional interest earning assets and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
our non cash assets are largely actual or implied aaa assets  and accordingly  we have not had  nor do we anticipate having  difficulty in converting our assets to cash 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our interest earning assets could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of interest earning assets increases due to changes in market interest rates of market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of our agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such agency mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such agency mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our agency mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  interest expense on repurchase agreements and convertible senior notes  the non cancelable office lease and employment agreements at december  the table does not include the effect of net interest rate payments under our interest rate swap agreements 
the net swap payments will fluctuate based on monthly changes in the receive rate

during the year ended december   we received billion from principal repayments  and used leverage on our agency mortgage backed securities which provided billion in cash for the year ended december  in addition  we may from time to time sell securities as a source of cash to fund new purchases 
during the year ended december   we increased stockholders equity by billion  primarily from cash received from proceeds from follow on offerings and direct purchases and dividend reinvestment

as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands unrealized gain unrealized loss net unrealized loss gain includes unrealized gains loss on interest rate swaps 
unrealized changes in the estimated net fair value of available for sale investments have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net fair value of our available for sale investments securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
leverage our debt to equity ratio at december   and was  and  respectively 
we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary  as it currently does because of market conditions  from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we would cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our agency mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debentures by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors or purchasing interest only securities 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the years ended december  and we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the years ended december   and and for each quarter therein 
consequently  we met the reit income and asset tests 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  for the years ended december    and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
we currently rely on the exemption from registration provided by section c c of the investment company act 
section c c as interpreted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission or the sec  requires us to invest at least of our assets in mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate or qualifying real estate assets and at least of our assets in qualifying real estate assets plus real estate related assets 
the assets that we acquire  therefore  are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act 
we rely on an interpretation that whole pool certificates that are issued or guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae or agency whole pool certificates are qualifying real estate assets under section c c 
this interpretation was promulgated by the sec staff in a no action letter over years ago  was reaffirmed by the sec in and has been commonly relied on by mortgage reits 
on august   the sec issued a concept release titled companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments sec release no 
ic 
under the concept release  the sec is reviewing interpretive issues related to the section c c exemption 
among other things  the sec specifically is requesting comments on whether it should revisit whether agency whole pool certificates may be treated as qualifying real estate assets and whether entities  such as us  whose primary business consists of investing in agency whole pool certificates are the type of entities that congress intended to be encompassed by the exclusion provided by section c c 
the potential outcomes of the sec s actions are unclear as is the sec s timetable for its review and actions 
we determined that as of december  and december   we were in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by section c c of the investment company act as interpreted by the staff of the sec 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our agency mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors  inverse floaters and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in economic net interest income and portfolio value  should interest rates go up or down  and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
change in interest rate projected percentage change in economic net interest income projected percentage change in portfolio value  with effect of interest rate swaps basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points economic net interest income includes interest expense on interest rate swaps 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience 
within months months more than year to years years and over total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets cash equivalents reverse repurchase agreements us treasury securities securities borrowed agency mortgage backed securities principal agency debentures principal corporate debt total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities us treasury securities sold  not yet purchased repurchase agreements  with the effect of interest rate swaps securities loaned convertible senior notes principal total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
