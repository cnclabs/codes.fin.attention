management s discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
dollar and number of share amounts contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are in thousands  except per share amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions described below are those that we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current  and for some estimates  future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements 
as estimates are updated or actual amounts are known  our critical accounting estimates are revised  and operating results may be affected by the revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition woodward recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in implementing the four criteria stated above  we have found that determining when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  which determines whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and if delivery has occurred  may require judgment 
the passage of title indicates transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership from woodward to the customer  however  contract and customer specific circumstances are reviewed by management to ensure that transfer of title constitutes the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership 

table of contents examples of situations requiring management review and judgment  with respect to the passage of the risks and rewards of ownership  include interpretation of customer specific contract terms  situations where substantive performance obligations exist  such as completion of product testing that remain after product delivery to the customer  situations that require customer acceptance or in some instances regulatory acceptance of the product  and situations in countries whose laws provide for retention of some form of title by sellers such that woodward is able to recover goods in the event a customer defaults on payment 
based on management s determination  if the risks and rewards of ownership have not passed to the customer  revenue is deferred until this requirement is met
