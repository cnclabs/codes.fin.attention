item business life partners general 
life partners holdings  inc we or life partners is a specialty financial services company and the parent company of life partners  inc lpi 
lpi is the oldest and one of the more active companies in the united states engaged in the secondary market for life insurance known generally as life settlements 
lpi facilitates the sale of life settlements between sellers and purchasers  but does not take possession or control of the policies 
the purchasers acquire the life insurance policies at a discount to their face value for investment purposes 
the secondary market for life insurance policies 
lpi was incorporated in and has conducted business under the registered service mark life partners since our operating revenues are derived from fees for facilitating life settlement transactions 
life settlement transactions involve the sale of an existing life insurance policy to another party 
by selling the policy  the policyholder receives an immediate cash payment 
the purchaser takes an ownership interest in the policy at a discount to its face value and receives the death benefit under the policy when the insured dies 
we are a specialty financial services company  providing purchasing services for life settlements to our client base 
we facilitate these transactions by identifying  examining  and purchasing the policies as agent for the purchasers 
to meet market demand and maximize our value to our clients  we have made significant investments in proprietary software and processes that enable us to facilitate a higher volume of transactions while maintaining our quality controls 
since our inception  we have facilitated over  purchaser transactions involving over  policies totaling over billion in face value 
we believe our experience  infrastructure and intellectual capital provide us a unique market position within the life settlement market 
as a purchasing agent  we identify  examine and purchase policies on behalf of our clients that match their buying parameters and return expectations 
because we are obliged to work within these parameters  we must make offers that are competitive from the seller s point of view  but still fit within the buying parameters of our clients 
we locate potential policy owners generally through a network of life settlement brokers 
brokers are typically compensated based on a percentage of the face value of the policy sold and this amount is negotiated between the policyholder and the broker 
this compensation is paid upon the closing of a settlement 
we have long term relationships with many of the country s life settlement brokers and  for those that we transact business with  believe that these brokers adhere to applicable regulatory requirements when conducting their business 
broker referrals accounted for of our total business as measured by policy face value in each of fiscal  and in fiscal  two brokers made referrals whose policy face values represented over of our total business 
referrals from these brokers accounted for of our total business 
in fiscal  we had two brokers with or more of our total business  and who accounted for of our total business 
in fiscal  we had one broker with or more of our total business and it accounted for of our total business 
with the continued downturn in the life settlement markets  and in our business specifically  we anticipate lower levels of broker competition and we may experience increases in our supply concentration risk 
we categorize our purchasers of life settlements as either institutional or retail 
institutional purchasers are typically investment funds designed to acquire and hold life settlements 
we acted as the purchasing agent for an institutional fund  life assets trust  sa  a luxembourg joint stock company formerly known as life fund i  lp the trust  which closed in fiscal with life settlements totaling million in face value 
we supplied settlements with a face value of approximately million to the trust 
those sales accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal we are not presently acting as purchasing agent for the trust or any other institutional funds 
in addition to providing policies  we own a interest in the trust  which has distributed  to us from policy maturities through february  we have pursued the sponsorship of life settlement funds ourselves and offered funds in fiscal on a private placement basis 
we were unable to obtain sufficient subscriptions to close the funds and withdrew the placements 
we have no funds under management 
we pursued the sponsorship of funds believing that the funds would expand our retail efforts by affording purchasers an alternative to the current retail model in which purchasers acquire direct interests in policies 
the fund structure might also aid market penetration by enabling us to sell in states that treat life settlement transactions as securities  which may limit or block our ability to sell in those states 
for these reasons  we may pursue the sponsorship of life settlement funds in the future 
the majority of our clients are high net worth individuals  which we refer to as retail purchasers 
our retail purchasers generally come to us through a network of financial planners  whom we call licensees 
we developed this network through referrals and have long standing relationships with most of these financial planners 
although the financial planners can be compensated through fee based consultations paid by the purchaser  we compensate most of the financial planners based on the amount invested 
the compensation of financial planners is paid in cash upon the closing date of the transaction 
to purchase a life settlement  a prospective retail purchaser typically submits a purchaser application containing personal information such as the purchaser s name and address as well as affirmative representations establishing the purchaser as financially sophisticated 
a purchaser will also submit an agency agreement and special power of attorney  which appoints us as a limited agent of the purchaser to act on his or her behalf in purchasing a life settlement 
unless specifically waived by a purchaser  the agency agreement limits our authority to policies issued by an insurance carrier having an am best company rating of b or better and to policies beyond their contestable period generally two years or older 
as we identify and qualify policies  we distribute insurance and current medical status information on these policies with the insured s name and other identifying information redacted throughout our financial planner network 
we also make available to each purchaser  through their financial planner  standard disclosures discussing the nature and risks of making a life settlement purchase 
purchasers can then  in consultation with their financial planner or other professionals  select one or more policies  specify the portion of the policy or policies to be purchased and submit a reservation electronically 
to diversify their positions  retail purchasers generally buy fractional interests in one or more policies and not an entire policy  while institutional purchasers tend to purchase entire policies 
before reserving an interest  purchasers mail or wire funds for acquisition of the policies to an escrow agent and mail or deliver electronically a policy funding agreement to us 
the policy funding agreement identifies the policy or policies to be purchased  the acquisition price  the administrative services provided  and the escrow arrangements for receipt and disbursement of funds 
for the protection of the seller s ownership interest and the purchaser s monetary interest  all transactions are closed through advance trust life escrow services  lta advance trust  a licensed texas trust company  which serves as escrow agent 
advance trust will close a purchase when it receives from each purchaser executed policy funding agreements and the acquisition price for a policy  verifies that the policy is in full force and effect and that no security interest has attached to the policy  and receives a transfer of policy ownership form acknowledged by the insurance company 
advance trust then pays the seller the offer price net of fees and costs 
we send confirmation of the transaction to the purchaser as well as a copy of the assignment documents 
advance trust succeeds the dunnam dunnam  llp law firm  which previously served as escrow agent 
advance trust is owned by members of the law firm 
after closing the transaction  we generally hold title to the policy as nominee for the purchaser 
responsibility for policy premium costs passes to the purchaser  who typically funds the premium costs from the deposits with the escrow agent 
we strictly maintain the confidentiality of an insured s personal information in accordance with regulations promulgated by the texas department of insurance and other applicable state laws 
a purchaser will receive evidence of the transfer of ownership of the policy which identifies the insured  but will not receive contact information for the insured  which is available only to licensed life settlement companies like us 
we perform certain ministerial functions  such as monitoring the insured s health status and notifying the escrow agent upon the insured s death 
we also notify purchasers in instances in which the premium escrow account has been exhausted so that the purchaser can replenish the account to keep the policy from lapsing 
pricing the life settlement 
a purchaser s investment return from a life settlement depends on three factors the difference between the policy face amount and purchaser s cost basis consisting of the acquisition cost and premiums paid to maintain the policy  the length of the holding period  and the demise of the insured 
we price settlements based on a combination of the policy face amount  the anticipated life expectancy of an insured and policy maintenance costs 
we do not estimate life expectancies in house  but have relied on outside sources 
for many years  a physician  dr 
donald t 
cassidy  of reno  nevada  provided our life expectancy estimations 
in fiscal  we added st services  llc 
dr 
cassidy uses a deterministic methodology  in which he adjusts an insured s standard life expectancy to account for the insured s medical conditions  family health history  and lifestyle 
during fiscal  dr 
cassidy reviewed approximately policies per month or about policies per business day  including updates on policies previously reviewed 
we are also obtaining a second life expectancy estimate from st services  llc 
st services assigns a median life expectancy based on proprietary mortality tables that it adjusts to account for the insured s medical conditions  family health history  and social lifestyle factors 
to establish the escrow account for future premiums  we use the longer of the two estimates 
when pricing the settlement  we consider the policy face amount and the acquisition costs  including future premium and transaction costs 
we then deduct the estimated maintenance costs and the transaction costs from the face amount and take a further discount as a hedge for the imprecise nature of the estimates 
this hedge protects the investment return to some extent if an insured lives beyond his or her estimated life expectancy 
conflicts of interest 
our business model can pose conflicts of interest  which may arise when we purchase policies for our own account while purchasing policies for others 
conflicts could arise between retail and institutional purchasers if we were to favor one over the other 
a financial incentive to favor one over the other could exist if the compensation that we earn is higher with one type of purchaser than the other or  in the case of institutional purchasers  if we have a financial interest in the institutional purchaser 
we believe that several factors mitigate the conflicts 
we work to ensure the neutral pricing of policies  that is  to ensure that policies are priced according to the value and risk presented 
if pricing is neutral  there is no financial reason for favoring one policy over another 
one factor in policy pricing is assessing life expectancy  which is determined in our model by an outside practicing physician and leading industry provider 
once we have the life expectancy  we apply a pricing formula to determine the purchase price 
further  most sellers are represented by experienced brokers  who know the market for settlements 
another factor that reduces the impact of conflicts is that policies are typically sold in pieces rather than in whole 
thus  several purchasers participate side by side in a single policy  which diminishes the risk that one purchaser might be favored over another purchaser 
the methods by which purchasers select policies also reduce the potential for conflicts 
retail purchasers choose the policies in which they wish to participate from the available policies posted on our website 
institutional purchasers will typically set the parameters of policies that they wish to acquire 
we also avoid conflicts since we rarely compete against our retail or institutional purchasers in acquiring policies 
we purchased the bulk of the policies for our own account as part of settlement agreements or tertiary purchases  in which we acquired previously purchased policies because they were no longer suitable for the purchasers 
these were not opportunities offered to our retail or institutional purchasers and thus we were not competing with our purchasers 
in the combined fiscal years  and  we acquired  interests in policies for our own account  all but of which were a part of a settlement or a tertiary purchase 
in fiscal  we also invested in one institutional fund  for which we served as a purchasing agent 
the fund has completed its acquisitions of policies and is no longer purchasing 
we supplied approximately of the policies purchased by the fund  and its purchases from us were never more than of our revenues in any one year 
our compensation from the fund was less than the compensation we typically earned on retail purchases 
the life settlement market and competition 
life settlements provide a secondary market for existing life insurance policies that the owner no longer needs or wants and that insure a person whose life expectancy can be reasonably estimated 
from the early s through  the market for life settlements grew substantially from both the demand and the supply sides of the transaction with an increase in the average face amount of policies presented for sale 
following the and financial crisis  however  the face value of transactions has declined dramatically 
in reports issued in and  the insurance research group  conning co 
the conning reports  estimated that the life settlement industry completed billion in face value of transactions in  but dropped to billion in  billion in and billion in based on our own research from other providers  publicly reported data and estimates based on historical data  we concur with conning s estimate that the total amount of face value of transactions completed by the life settlement industry in calendar shrunk to about billion 
the conning report suggests the decrease in the life settlement market results from a lack of capital due to the lingering distress in the credit and investment markets following the and financial crisis  increases in life expectancies  and investor concern regarding liquidity 
conning forecasts that the life settlement market overall will remain flat or decline during calendar and will remain relatively flat beyond we concur with conning s predictions about the market and feel we cannot predict with any certainty what the life settlement market will be past continuing instability within the economy could undermine investor confidence or reduce available investment capital and soften demand for all investments including alternative investments such as life settlements 
demand may also be adversely affected if interest rates on government issued debt and certificates of deposit increase substantially 
however  the conning report notes  and we agree that life settlements remain an attractive alternative investment because the asset class has a low correlation to fixed income and equity securities and offers investors the potential to generate competitive returns 
we believe that life settlements should be appealing as an asset class  especially given the low interest rate environment for fixed income investments and equity market volatility 
weaker demand should not diminish the supply of attractive policies  primarily because policy holders desiring to monetize their policies have few viable alternatives 
the attractiveness of a life settlement for insureds is in the value that they can realize from life settlements  which exceeds the cash surrender value that life insurance companies will pay and the avoided costs of letting policies lapse 
we believe the growing awareness among policy owners and their financial professionals and advisors of the value to be realized from life settlements plus an aging population should produce an ample supply of attractive policies  especially policies with higher face values 
due to shrinking demand for settlements  coupled with reduced access to capital  the insurance industry s addition of pre death cash benefits  law enforcement pressure on companies operating illegally  and increasing government regulation  we believe the number of active participants in the life settlement market has decreased to approximately companies  which is down from active participants in market participation also appears to be more diffuse than in prior years 
while precise industry and company specific data are not readily available  we estimate that our largest industry competitor currently has approximately of the total market share based on the estimated face value of calendar year transactions  which is down from a market share in calendar year another market participant appears to have had approximately of the market in  but with no discernible market participation in or we estimate our market share was approximately in calendar  which is down from an estimated of market share in calendar in the remainder of the market  we estimate only one other competitor for whom we have reported information had approximately of the total market share and all other market participants had less than of the total market share for calendar most industry participants use significant amounts of borrowing to acquire policies and rely on a single or preferred institutional client model for purchasing 
of the larger industry participants  we are the only company that uses no leverage and relies on a broad retail purchasing model 
this approach worked well for us as the credit markets tightened in our fiscal and our fiscal started well  but in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we were subject to an investigation by the securities and exchange commission the sec and a national news publication ran a series of articles that were critical of our operations 
following these events  we experienced a drop in our stock price and in purchaser demand through our licensee network 
a number of private legal actions resulting from these events soon followed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the sec filed an action against us and our officers  which is more completely described below in item legal proceedings 
the uncertainty resulting from these legal developments hurt demand in our business during fiscal during fiscal  we closed transactions compared with transactions in fiscal  mostly due to lower purchaser interest 
despite this decrease in demand  we continued to be selective about policies presented to our clients 
during fiscal  an average of almost policies per month were submitted to us for review 
of this number  we made offers on an average of policies per month resulting in an average of five completed transactions per month 
the supply of attractive policies is supported by our average face value per policy  which remained fairly stable in fiscal at million versus million for fiscal and million for fiscal average revenue per settlement declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we have responded to licensee and client concerns by addressing issues in the articles and lawsuits through correspondence and meetings with licensees 
we noted that both the articles and the claims by the sec used a sampling period for life expectancies that related generally to viatical settlements with hiv insureds 
with medical advances  some of these insureds have lived far beyond their original life expectancy 
this development was not unique to us  but affected the industry generally 
due to these developments  we have not engaged in a material number of viatical settlements since we believe the sampling of viatical settlements does not reflect the accuracy of our estimates for life settlements 
nonetheless  some data indicates that the life settlement industry may have underestimated life expectancies 
the possibility was raised in the conning report and is perhaps indicated in aig s million impairment on its life settlement portfolio  which it took in the second quarter of due to revised life expectancies 
since most of our business activity occurred in fiscal through and the average life expectancies for life settlements range from four years or more  we do not have a sufficient sample to assess the accuracy of our life expectancies under our current methodologies 
we recognize and appreciate the need for accurate life expectancies and it is in our best interest to use the best estimates reasonably available 
because we risk adjust our settlement prices for the possibility of an exceeded life expectancy  we believe our settlements will provide reasonable investment returns even when a settlor lives beyond the life expectancy estimate 
in response to licensee concerns and market demand  we have modified our procedures to include two life expectancy opinions for each policy presented 
in addition  we escrow premiums for the longer of the two life expectancy opinions 
advance trust life escrow services  lta  which is a licensed texas trust company  has succeeded the dunnam dunnam  llp law firm as the settlement escrow agent 
we believe these responses and changes will encourage demand within our license network and purchaser base 
but until we can satisfactorily resolve the sec litigation  we believe that purchase demand will not recover and return to the levels we experienced in fiscal and we continue to believe that our broad based  retail oriented purchasing model provides an attractive platform 
our experience within the industry  our licensee network  and a scalable infrastructure provide value to both policyholders and our clients 
nonetheless  competition within the life settlement market remains active  and we will continue to experience competition for attractive policies 
this competition affects the prices we pay for policies  the amount of brokerage and referral fees we pay  and the prices we set for the purchase of policies 
we believe the overall supply of life settlements will increase over the long term as the population ages and more seniors become aware of their option to liquidate an unwanted policy through a life settlement 
the primary market limitation will be softer demand  which is further affected in our case by the sec litigation 
the following table shows the number of life settlement contracts policies we have transacted  the aggregate face values and purchase prices of those contracts  and the revenues we derived for our last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal number of settlements policies face value of policies   average revenue per settlement    total net revenues derived   the revenues derived are exclusive of brokerage and referral fees 
industry regulation and taxation general 
when the life settlement market was first established  it was sparsely regulated 
due in part to well publicized abuses within the industry  the federal government and various states moved to regulate the market in the mid s 
these regulations generally took two forms 
one sought to apply consumer protection type regulations to the market 
this application was designed to protect policyholders and purchasers 
another sought to apply securities regulations to the market  in an effort to protect purchasers 
various states have also used their insurance regulations to guard against insurance fraud within the industry 
consumer protection licensing 
the consumer protection type regulations arose largely from the draft of model laws and regulations promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic and the national conference of insurance legislators ncoil 
while seven states and the district of columbia have no regulation and four states regulate only viatical settlements  states have now adopted some version of these model laws or another form of regulation governing life settlement companies in some way 
these laws generally require the licensing of providers and brokers  require the filing and approval of settlement agreements and disclosure statements  describe the content of disclosures that must be made to insureds and sellers  describe various periodic reporting requirements for settlement companies and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive 
some of these laws fix minimum payment levels that a purchaser must pay a selling insured based on the insured s life expectancy 
the minimum payment requirements generally apply when the insured is terminally ill or has a short life expectancy typically to months or less 
in our settlement transactions  we typically deal with policies having life expectancies of months or longer and thus these requirements do not usually affect our settlement transactions 
licensing 
many states require the licensing of life settlement brokers and providers  mandate disclosures to sellers or purchasers or both  require periodic reporting requirements  and set forth prohibited business practices 
we are licensed as a viatical and life settlement company by the texas department of insurance 
under the texas requirements  we must file our transaction documents with the state for approval  make certain disclosures to insureds and sellers  offer a day right of rescission to the seller  file certain annual reports with the state  and abstain from unfair business practices 
other states have their own licensing requirements in order to purchase policies from policy owners in those states and we must comply with those requirements as well 
in addition to texas  we are licensed to engage in life settlement transactions with policy owners residing in the following states arkansas  connecticut  illinois  maryland  minnesota  mississippi  nevada  new jersey  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  tennessee and virginia 
we also purchase from policy owners in other states  which have available exemptions from licensing requirements 
we are not presently licensed in california or new york  where the pendency of the sec suit has adversely affected our licensing applications

jsp tdinum securities regulations 
there has been a growing trend to treat life settlements as securities under federal or state securities laws 
under federal securities laws  the federal circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled in that our settlement transactions are not investment contracts under the federal securities laws 
we have relied upon that decision and continue to rely on that decision with regard to the non applicability of federal securities laws to our transactions 
other federal courts  considering other facts and parties  have ruled that life settlement transactions may be considered investment contracts  and the sec issued a staff report in july indicating its desire to regulate life settlements as securities 
to date  no legislative or administrative changes to existing federal securities laws have been proposed to treat life settlements as securities  but such proposals are possible 
most states treat life settlements as securities under statutes  regulations or case law 
to comply with these state securities laws  we typically seek exceptions or registration exemptions that enable our settlement transactions in those states despite their treatment as securities 
the trend toward increased regulation of life settlements as securities could affect our business significantly 
if the federal securities laws were amended to cover life settlements  we could be required to register the settlements likely as a securitized pool and to form or associate with a registered broker dealer 
registration of life settlements under the federal securities laws would significantly disrupt our retail based purchasing model 
until and unless the securities laws are amended  however  we continue to rely on the court of appeals decision holding that our settlement transactions are not securities under federal law 
we believe that a combination of consumer protection type laws and existing insurance regulations provide an appropriate framework for regulation of the industry 
as a practical matter  the widespread application of securities laws  without viable registration exemptions  would burden us and senior americans attempting to sell their policies with little or no benefit to purchasers 
our purchasers represent themselves to be financially sophisticated  high net worth individuals or institutions  and they have considerably less need for the registration protocols of the securities laws 
at this point  due to the court of appeals decision and the availability  in some instances  of exceptions and exemptions under state securities laws  the federal and state securities laws have not limited our business model to a significant extent 
but we cannot give assurance that our business would not be materially and adversely impacted by securities based regulation 
insurance regulation 
as a life settlement company  we facilitate the transfer of ownership in life insurance policies  but do not participate in the issuance of policies 
further  we do not issue any type of contemporaneous agreement to purchase a policy at the time the policy is issued 
as such  we are not required to be licensed as an insurance company or insurance broker 
we do deal  however  with insurance companies and professionals in our business and are affected indirectly by the regulations covering them 
the insurance industry is highly regulated  and these regulations affect us in numerous ways 
we must understand the regulations as they apply to policy terms and provisions and the entitlement to  and collectability of  policy benefits 
we rely upon the protections against fraudulent conduct that these regulations offer  and we rely upon the licensing of companies and individuals with whom we do business 
employees as of february   we had direct employees  none of whom is represented by a labor union 
we continuously review benefits and other matters of interest to our employees and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 
as of february   we also had  licensees  who have done business with us in the last five years 
licensees act as independent contractors and refer clients to us for the purchase of life settlements

this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that have been made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our life settlement transaction volumes and the trading price of our stock have declined following adverse publicity about our business and the filing of an sec enforcement action 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were hurt by news articles critical of our business and by the announcement of a pending sec investigation 
several putative securities class actions and shareholder derivative claims were subsequently filed against us and certain officers and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the sec filed a civil enforcement action against us and certain officers 
these developments adversely affected our licensee network and purchaser base 
our volume of life settlement transactions dropped  as did our profitability and stock price 
the developments particularly affected our business in that we are the only publicly held  life settlement company and the only prominent company with a broad  retail base within the life settlement industry 
we believe the adverse publicity affected our client base more acutely than the publicity might have affected a company with an institutional oriented base 
whether we can restore our transaction volumes will depend largely on our success in restoring trust and confidence within our licensee network and purchaser base and in resolving the sec suit 
we believe the news articles portrayed us in a false light  and we have worked with our licensees and clients to restore lost confidence and rebut the charges in the articles 
whether we can gradually repair our client base and return to the levels of activity we enjoyed in fiscal and will depend largely on whether the sec suit can be resolved satisfactorily 
if the sec suit lingers or is not resolved satisfactorily  our business will continue to suffer 
the outcomes of the sec enforcement action and the civil suits filed against us could hurt our business significantly 
the sec has filed an enforcement action against us and our officers 
in addition  there are pending putative securities and breach of fiduciary duty class actions and shareholder derivative claims related to our business and that of our operating subsidiary  lpi  which pose significant risks for our business 
in the sec enforcement action  the sec is seeking monetary and injunctive relief against us and three of our executive officers  brian d 
pardo  r 
scott peden and david martin  for possible violations of federal securities laws 
these claims relate primarily to our knowledge of  and disclosures about  the accuracy of the estimates of the life expectancies of settlors and our disclosures regarding and the propriety of and disclosures relating to certain of our accounting policies and practices  including revenue recognition and the impairment of life settlements held by us for investment 
we cannot predict what the outcome of the action may be 
the sec investigation and the subsequent enforcement action has required considerable legal expense and management s time and attention and has damaged our licensee network and purchaser base  which are crucial to our transaction volumes 
moreover  the enforcement proceeding could subject us or our management to injunctions  fines  and other penalties or sanctions  loss of key personnel  or other adverse consequences 
our executive management team is relatively small and their industry knowledge is unique and highly specialized 
sec sanctions against one or more of our executive officers would be highly damaging to us 
the pending putative private securities and breach of fiduciary duty class actions and shareholder derivative claims were filed following the announcement of the sec investigation and a series of news articles critical of our business  which resulted in a drop in our stock price 
the complaints fall generally into three categories 
the first alleges that we and certain of our current and former officers violated disclosure regulations under the federal securities laws 
a second category is shareholder derivative claims alleging the directors breaches of fiduciary duties relating to false or omitted disclosures 
a third category of complaints are life settlement purchaser claims alleging breach of fiduciary duties  breach of contract or both in the underestimation of life expectancies 
while we believe we have complied with the federal securities laws  have breached no duties  and will prevail if these claims are adjudicated  the legal defense costs are a significant expense to us 
these kinds of actions are complex and often continue for years 
the burden of continuing the legal defense will weigh on our business  impact results of operations and cash flows  and depress the price of our stock 
our success depends on restoring trust within our referral networks 
we rely primarily upon brokers to refer potential sellers of policies to us and upon financial professionals  known as licensees  to refer retail purchasers to us 
these relationships are essential to our operations and we must maintain these relationships to be successful 
we do not have fixed contractual arrangements with life settlement brokers  and they are free to do business with our competitors 
our network of licensees is much broader  but no less important 
the announcements of the sec investigation and subsequent enforcement action  other private litigation  and critical news articles have damaged our reputation within the industry and have hurt our business 
our licensee network was particularly hurt  which has reduced the supply of capital for the purchase of life settlements and our transaction volumes 
our ability to restore and sustain relationships with our licensees will depend upon our ability to rebut the adverse publicity  to restore trust in the relationships  to resolve the sec litigation satisfactorily  to maintain reasonable settlement closing rates  to bring value to our retail clients  and to compensate the referring professional at reasonable levels 
the extent to which the life settlement market will recover following the economic crisis is uncertain 
after several years of growth  the life settlement market has declined since in the wake of the economic crisis 
the capital markets appear to have turned away from alternative asset classes 
whether and when the life settlement market will return to prior levels or beyond may be affected by a variety of factors  including the ability to attract sufficient qualified purchasers  the ability to convince potential sellers of the benefits of life settlements  the occurrence of illegal or abusive business practices resulting in negative publicity about the market  and the adoption of overly burdensome governmental regulation 
the stagnant economy appears to be hampering the recovery of the life settlement market 
if the life settlement market does not recover to prior levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
a growing trend to treat life settlements as securities could disrupt our business model  which relies on our life settlement transactions not being securities 
our business model relies on retail sales of policies to financially sophisticated  high net worth individuals 
we generally do not treat these sales as securities transactions under federal securities laws in reliance on a federal district of columbia circuit case dealing specifically with our settlement transactions  which held that the settlement transactions were not securities under federal law 
under state securities laws  we generally rely on various exceptions or registration exemptions that enable our settlement transactions in those states 
there has been a growing trend  however  to treat life settlements as securities under federal or state securities laws 
in july  the sec issued a staff report recommending that congress adopt legislation regulating life settlements as securities 
if the federal securities laws were amended to cover life settlements and no exemption from registration were available  our retail based purchasing model would be significantly disrupted 
our model could also be disrupted by the further application of state securities registration requirements  especially in those states in which we have significant purchaser demand 
our purchasers depend on our ability to predict life expectancies and set appropriate prices  if our investment returns are not competitive  we may lose purchasers 
we price settlements based on the policy face amount  the anticipated life expectancy of an insured and policy maintenance costs 
life expectancy opinions are estimated from medical and actuarial data  which is adjusted by the opinion givers to account for the insured s medical conditions  family health history  and social lifestyle factors 
the data is based necessarily on statistical probabilities involving mortality and morbidity data and  with respect to the opinions of our outside practicing physician  upon his assessment of the effects of the insured s condition 
the outcome of a single settlement may vary significantly from the statistical average 
it is impossible to predict any one insured s life expectancy exactly 
to mitigate the risk that an insured will outlive his or her predicted life expectancy  we price life settlements to yield positive returns even if this life expectancy estimate is exceeded by several years 
in addition  life settlement purchasers must be able to bear a non liquid investment for an indeterminate period 
if we underestimate the average life expectancies and price our transactions too high  our purchasers will realize smaller returns  demand may fall  and purchasers may invest their funds elsewhere 
in addition  amounts escrowed for premiums may be insufficient to keep the policy in force  requiring purchasers to invest further proceeds to pay these additional premiums  which weakens demand for future settlements and hurts our goodwill with purchasers 
if we overestimate the average life expectancies  the settlement prices we offer will fall below market levels  the policy supply will decrease  and sellers may engage in business with our competitors or pursue other alternatives 
our ability to accurately predict life expectancies and price accordingly is affected by a number of factors  including the accuracy of our life expectancy estimates  which must sufficiently account for factors including an insured s age  medical condition  life habits such as smoking  and geographic location  our ability to anticipate and adjust for trends  such as advances in medical treatments  that affect life expectancy data  and our ability to balance competing interests when pricing settlements  such as the amounts paid to policy sellers  the acquisition costs paid by purchasers  and the compensation paid to ourselves and our referral networks 
to support our pricing systems  we use life expectancy estimates from an outside practicing physician and a leading industry provider 
we cannot assure purchasers that  despite our experience in settlement pricing  we will not err by underestimating or overestimating average life expectancies or miscalculating reserve amounts for future premiums 
if we do so  we could lose purchasers or policy sellers  and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely on outside persons for life expectancy estimates 
an important component of our pricing system is the life expectancy estimate 
rather than assessing life expectancy in house  we have relied historically on an outside practicing physician  dr 
donald t 
cassidy  of reno  nevada 
we have recently implemented a practice of obtaining a second life expectancy estimate from a leading industry provider  st services  llc  in addition to dr 
cassidy s estimate 
we believe a life expectancy estimate that accounts for individual circumstances is useful in arriving at a settlement price and is preferable to a probabilistic methodology that relies solely on actuarial and statistical data 
while their methodologies and data sourcing vary somewhat  each of the analyses done by dr 
cassidy or st services adjusts the estimate from life expectancy tables to account for the insured s medical conditions  family health history  and social lifestyle factors 
while we believe these adjustments will produce life expectancy estimates that are more appropriate for pricing individual policies  any methodology is merely an estimate of how long the insured will live based upon statistical probability  medical and actuarial data  and the interpretation of such data  and no one can predict with certainty when a particular insured will die 
in using estimates  however  we are relying upon predictions that are inherently uncertain 
if those estimates tended consistently to underestimate or overestimate life expectancies  our business could be adversely affected 
government regulation could negatively impact our business 
we are licensed and regulated by the texas department of insurance as a viatical and life settlement company and hold licenses as a life settlement provider in other states as well 
state laws requiring the licensing of life settlement providers govern many aspects of our conduct  operations  advertising and disclosures and are designed to afford consumer protection benefits 
the laws may vary from state to state  however  and our activities and those of brokers with whom we do business can be affected by changes in these laws or different interpretations of these laws 
in addition  some states and the sec treat certain life settlements as securities under state and federal securities laws  which pose unique risks 
while we believe consumer protection type laws and insurance regulations are important to maintain a healthy industry  compliance with laws regulating life settlement companies and life settlement providers is costly and complex and poses a risk of inadvertent violation 
further  changes in these laws or governmental regulation could affect our brokers or clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our chairman and chief executive officer beneficially owns of our common stock and  as a result  can exercise significant influence over us under sec regulations  mr 
brian d 
pardo  our chairman and chief executive officer  is considered the beneficial owner of approximately of our common stock  largely as the result of exercising voting power by proxy over shares held by the pardo family trust 
he will be able to control most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
his voting control affects indirectly the process for nominating directors  since theoretically he could nominate and elect directors without board involvement 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of life partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock

cv the suit alleges that we  our chairman and ceo brian pardo  general counsel scott peden  and chief financial officer david martin had knowledge of  but failed to disclose to our shareholders  the alleged underestimation of the life expectancies of settlors of viatical and life settlement policies 
the suit further claims that we prematurely recognized revenues from the sale of the settlements and that we understated the impairment of our investments in policies 
the suit also claims that pardo and peden sold shares while possessing inside information  which was the alleged knowledge of the purported underestimation of life expectancies and the impact on our revenues from the purported underestimation 
in addition  the suit alleges that the defendants misled our auditors about our revenue recognition policy 
the suit contains claims for violations of various federal securities statutes and regulations  including violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities act of and the securities and exchange act of  and rules under those acts  and seeks various forms of relief  including injunctive relief  disgorgement  and civil penalties 
we believe our internal data  along with applicable industry trends and practices  refute the claims about the underestimation of life expectancies and that our revenue recognition practices  which were addressed in our form k for the period ended february   did not result in violations of the federal securities laws

following the filing of a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and response and reply briefing by both sides  and following the sec s filing of its complaint  on january   plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for leave to amend complaint  which the district court granted on february  on february   plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint alleging the same claims that were asserted in the prior complaint 
however  by the amended complaint  plaintiffs assert substantially similar  and at times identical  facts and allegations to those asserted by the sec in its complaint 
plaintiffs seek damages and an award of costs on behalf of a class of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between may   and june  on march   defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint  which is currently pending 
we  our directors  and certain present and former officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative suit  which is based generally on the same alleged facts as the putative class action suits 
on or about february   our board of directors received a shareholder demand letter sent on behalf of gregory griswold 
that demand letter claimed that we were damaged because our business practices caused

this complaint dropped goldstein as a plaintiff 
the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to us the company through the use of excessive life expectancies and incorrect accounting practices  which in general tracked the allegations previously disclosed regarding the sec s wells notice and our prior auditors resignation  and alleges that these breaches were not properly disclosed resulting in violations of the federal securities laws 
the complaint also claimed that the defendants caused us to pay abnormally large dividends for the benefit of brian pardo  and the defendants subjected us to adverse publicity as well as lawsuits and regulatory investigations 
the complaint also claims that brian pardo and scott peden had used their knowledge of life partners material  non public information to sell their personal holdings while 
our 
stock was artificially inflated  and that the audit committee had failed to exercise proper oversight 
on october   the independent directors filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims covering the use of unsupportable life expectancies  and a motion to stay the remaining claims to allow time to complete a review as to whether it was in our best interests to pursue the remaining claims 
that review construed the complaint and berger s demand letter as raising largely the same claims 
on october   the independent directors completed their investigation and issued a confidential report  which contained their determination that it would not be in our best interests to pursue any of the claims set forth in the complaint or berger s demand letter since the claims are not well founded and have little likelihood of success 
on december   the independent directors filed an amended motion to dismiss all claims in the complaint  based on the findings of their investigation 
plaintiffs are conducting limited discovery in response to the motion to dismiss 
on january   berger filed a complaint  also in the united states district court for the western district of texas  del rio division  substantially setting forth the allegations in his earlier demand letter

plaintiffs ultimately amended their petition several times  adding additional named plaintiffs  and dismissing us the company with prejudice 
plaintiffs asserted two causes of action 
the first claim asserted that defendants violated the registration provisions of the texas securities act because the life settlements facilitated by lpi were securities and were not registered 
the second claim asserted that defendants committed fraud under the texas securities act because they represented that the life settlements were not securities 
lpi answered and filed counterclaims against plaintiffs for the filing of a frivolous lawsuit 
on september   the court entered an order granting lpi s motion for partial summary judgment 
the motion was based on  among other arguments  the arguments that the life settlements had previously been held not to be securities under federal and state law 
as a result of the court order  plaintiffs claims against lpi were dismissed with prejudice

angela austin  et 
al  cause no 
 filed on may  plaintiffs defendants are approximately individuals and entities who purchased life and viatical settlement policies through lpi 
this suit is substantially similar to and overlaps with the other lawsuits brought by life settlement investors 
the claims arise from allegations that lpi used improper life expectancies on its life and viatical settlement transactions and made false or misleading representations related to the life expectancies 
the specific causes of action brought by plaintiffs are fraudulent misrepresentation  breach of fiduciary duty  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing both on a contract and tort basis  violations of nevada s viatical settlement act  violations of nevada s deceptive trade practices act  rescission  breach of contract  unjust enrichment  fraud in the inducement  and negligence per se 
the suit filed by lpi in texas was filed before the nevada suit  and was an attempt to preempt the plaintiffs suit and adjudicate the parties rights under the applicable contracts 
the parties are currently awaiting rulings that will determine in which court the action will proceed 
while management believes that we have meritorious defenses in all of the above legal proceedings  including the sec suit  and we fully intend to defend these proceedings vigorously  as with all litigation  the defense of such proceedings is subject to inherent uncertainties  and the actual costs will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are as yet unknown and unascertainable 
likewise  the outcome of any litigation is necessarily uncertain 
we may be forced to continue to expend considerable funds in connection with attorneys fees  costs  and litigation related expenses associated with the defense of these proceedings  and management s time and attention will also be taxed during the pendency of these proceedings 
we are subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we reserve for such losses 
except as discussed above i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of our pending litigation  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any pending litigation  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of any pending proceeding 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  management believes  and we have been so advised by counsel handling the respective proceedings  that we have a number of valid legal defenses in all pending litigation to which we or our directors or officers are a party  as well as valid bases for appeal of potential adverse rulings that may be rendered against us 
all such proceedings are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended  and  to the extent available  all valid counterclaims pursued 
notwithstanding this fact  we may enter into settlement discussions in particular proceedings if we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders to do so

we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the nature of the restatement is discussed more fully below 
we provide the following discussion to assist in understanding our financial position as of february  fiscal  and results of operations for the years ended february   and february  fiscal and fiscal 
as you read this discussion  refer to our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the material line items of these statements 
critical accounting estimates  assumptions and policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to guide our preparation  we follow accounting policies  some of which represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
certain accounting estimates involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period that management considers to be critical accounting estimates 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  management s experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results may differ materially from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
areas affected by our estimates and assumptions are identified below 
we recognize revenue at the time a settlement closes and defer costs for anticipated policy monitoring costs 
we amortize this deferred cost over the anticipated life expectancy of the insureds 
we sometimes make short term advances to facilitate a life settlement transaction 
these amounts are included in accounts receivable trade and are collected as the life settlement transactions close 
all amounts are considered collectible as we are repaid the advance before any of the other parties involved in the transaction receive funds 
we follow the guidance contained in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  investments in insurance contracts  to account for our investments in life settlement contracts 
asc states that a purchaser may elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
under the investment method  a purchaser recognizes the initial investment at the purchase price plus all initial direct costs 
continuing costs eg  policy premiums and direct external costs  if any to keep the policy in force are capitalized 
under the fair value method  a purchaser recognizes the initial investment at the purchase price 
in subsequent periods  the purchaser re measures the investment at fair value in its entirety at each reporting period and recognizes changes in fair value earnings or other performance indicators for entities that do not report earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
we elected to value our investments in life settlement contracts using the investment method 
investment in life settlements held for our own account were carried at  and  at february  and february   respectively 
we review the carrying value of our investments in policies for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of the policies from future maturities 
in cases where undiscounted expected proceeds from future maturities are less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to an amount by which the carrying value including expected future costs to maintain the policies exceeds the expected proceeds 
based on this assessment  we recorded impairment costs for investments in policies of   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
we establish litigation and policy analysis loss accruals based on our best estimates as to the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities 
this loss analysis is necessary to properly match current expenses to currently recognized revenues and to recognize that there is a certain amount of liability associated with litigation and policy losses 
through these accruals  we recognize the estimated cost to settle pending litigation as an expense 
these estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to management s best estimate of the anticipated liability on a case by case basis 
a high degree of judgment is required in determining these estimated accrual amounts since the outcomes are affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  there is a risk that the estimates of future litigation and policy analysis loss costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
any difference between estimates and actual final outcomes could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts and notes receivable and premium advances 
the accounts associated with these areas are critical to recognizing the correct amount of revenue and expenses in the proper period 
within the last quarter of fiscal  issues were resolved which have enabled us to better estimate the collectability of premium advances 
the agreement with the state of texas allowed us to specifically identify a class of investors for whom we made premium advances and which  under the terms of the agreement  will be uncollectible 
our historical success of collecting premium advances enabled us to build a body of evidence by which we can demonstrate full collectability of the remaining balance of advanced premiums 
as a result of the resolution of the suit  the reserve for uncollectible premium advances is based on our best estimate and historical data and premium advances are no longer fully reserved 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment includes current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the property is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment for property and equipment during fiscal  and we must evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment to assure that an adequate amount of depreciation is being charged to operations 
useful lives are based generally on specific knowledge of life for specific types of assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include a tax provision or reduce our tax benefit in the statements of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements have been issued including asu   and for a discussion of these pronouncements  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
life partners we are the world s oldest and only publicly traded company operating exclusively in the life settlement industry 
our revenues are primarily derived from fees associated with facilitating life settlement transactions 
comparison of years ended february   and we had a net loss of  for fiscal  compared to net income of  for fiscal and  for fiscal the net loss in fiscal  with a decrease in gross revenues and a decline in revenues  net of brokerage fees  was due to three factors 
first  our licensee network and purchaser base were damaged by the sec investigation and subsequent lawsuit  the filing of multiple private suits  and publication of news articles criticizing our operations 
a second contributing factor was the substantial decline in the life settlement market  which dropped from an estimated billion in face value transactions in calendar to approximately billion in each of calendar and the third factor was our large increase in legal and professional expense 
large reductions in impairment expense and bonuses were positive influences on fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal was primarily the result of the aforementioned general market decline  the news articles and disclosure of the sec investigation  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  our ability to increase our operating margins by remaining highly selective in our purchasing strategies resulted in a increase in revenues net of brokerage and licensee fees 
the increase in revenues  net of brokerage fees  together with the large decrease in the allowance account for premium advances  resulted in an increase in income from operations of 
legal and professional costs were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  and were the largest single general and administrative expense 
the legal and professional costs were attributable primarily to legal costs associated with the sec investigation and lawsuit  litigation  and our audit fees 
see item  legal proceedings 
revenues revenues decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the decreased number of settlements  from in fiscal to in fiscal  along with lower revenues  net of brokerage fees  as a percentage of gross revenue 
revenues  net of brokerage fees  was of gross revenue in fiscal  vs 
in fiscal and in fiscal  as we increased promotional bonuses and lowered our fees to obtain business 
average revenue per settlement also declined  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal revenues decreased  in fiscal  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the decreased number of settlements from in fiscal to in fiscal and a decrease in the total face value of policies from  in fiscal to  in fiscal average revenue per settlement increased in both fiscal and the average revenue per settlement increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the global economic recession in fiscal and its aftermath resulted in declines in the estimated life settlements market 
the well regarded conning reports for and indicated that the life settlement industry completed billion in face value of transactions in calendar  but dropped to billion in and to billion in despite these industry trends  in fiscal  demand for our services remained strong 
the number of policies that met our purchasing qualifications remained constant  and we continued to see a supply of policies with higher face values 
the demand side also showed promise in fiscal with increases in average revenue per settlement and in total revenues derived from settlements 
we believe this demand resulted from our broad based  retail oriented purchasing model and referrals from a large licensee network  in contrast to many of our competitors  which rely on the credit markets or a single institutional provider of investment capital 
in fiscal  we believe the life settlements market suffered even further declines 
the conning report indicated a market drop from approximately billion in face amount transacted in to approximately billion in while our fiscal results did not reflect the size of drop suggested in the conning report for calendar  our fiscal results were generally weaker than in fiscal our fiscal was also adversely affected in the fourth quarter by a series of news articles critical of our operations and our disclosure of an sec investigation 
these latter events especially affected our licensee network and purchaser base and resulted in significant revenue declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout all of fiscal in the first two quarters of fiscal  our results of operations had held up relatively well despite the industry downturn 
our revenues and net income were relatively stable and the metrics that we use to measure performance  such as average policy face value and revenues per settlement  were also stable 
in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  however  our quarterly revenues fell to  and  respectively  and the quarterly revenues for fiscal were    and  respectively 
net income fell to  in the third quarter and to  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we operated with a net loss throughout fiscal our number of settlements fell to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of fiscal and totaled for all of fiscal demand for life settlements generally is supported by a desire to diversify investment portfolios and avoid economically sensitive investments 
returns on life settlements are linked to the lives of the insureds 
as such  settlements function independently from  and are not correlated to  traditional equity and debt markets and commodity investments 
the industry benefits from the investment community searching for returns higher than what is currently available in the traditional marketplace 
the financial markets have remained somewhat unsteady following the financial crisis 
while this would appear to benefit the life settlement market  the life settlement market declines in and suggest retreating investor capital and a lack of confidence in the industry 
demand for our services was especially hurt by the critical news articles and the uncertainty related to the sec investigation and lawsuit  which affected our licensee network and purchaser base 
our business model is somewhat unique in the industry in that we are the only publicly held  life settlement company and the only prominent company with a broad  retail base 
we believe the adverse publicity affected our client base more acutely than the publicity might have affected a company with an institutional oriented base 
we believe the news articles portrayed us in a false light  and we have worked with our licensees and clients to restore lost confidence and rebut the charges in the articles 
our ability to return to fiscal or levels will not occur until and unless we can resolve the sec suit satisfactorily 
until the sec suit is resolved  we anticipate that our operating results in fiscal will be no better than fiscal and could decline further 
brokerage and referral fees brokerage and referral fees decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees constituted  and  of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  broker referrals accounted for of the total face value of policies transacted 
policies presented from two brokers each represented more than of all completed transactions in fiscal and represented in total 
policies presented from two brokers each represented more than of all completed transaction in fiscal and represented in total 
policies presented from one broker represented more than of all completed transactions in fiscal at 
brokerage and referral fees generally increase or decrease with revenues  face value of policies transacted and the volume of transactions  although the exact ratio may vary according to a number of factors 
brokers may adjust their fees with the individual policyholders whom they represent 
in some instances  several brokers may compete for representation of the same seller  which will result in lower broker fees 
referral fees also vary depending on factors such as varying contractual obligations  market demand for a particular kind of policy or life expectancy category and individual agreements between clients and their referring financial planners 
referral fees have increased as a percentage of revenues due to added promotional programs to stimulate transaction interest 
we also have reduced our fees on select brokerage transactions to remain competitive in the marketplace 
no broker fees are paid when a policy owner is not represented by a broker and presents a policy to us directly 
many states now license life settlement brokerage activity  which may result in the capping of fees or the increased disclosure of fees 
industry analysts have suggested that these regulations could tend to lower the fees  although we have yet to see such a result directly from regulation 
operating expense general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to executive bonuses 
bonuses decreased  in fiscal as there were no executive bonuses 
executive and employee bonuses decreased  in fiscal as earnings decreased 
increased payments in and decreased payments in and are a direct result of our increasing and decreasing profitability  which is linked to executive compensation plans and bonuses given to all employees 
legal and professional expenses were higher in fiscal   compared to  in fiscal these expenses are primarily associated with the sec investigation and lawsuit  the private litigation that followed disclosure of the sec investigation  and auditing fees 
legal and professional expenses in fiscal were the increase in legal and professional fees in fiscal was partially offset by lower impairment expense 
impairment expense for fiscal declined  to  as many of the older viatical policies that we own were fully impaired in previous periods 
we increased impairment expense for our investment in policies from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to longer projected life expectancies within the investment portfolio 
for various legal actions or claims in which we believe we might incur liability  we paid non recurring settlement expenses of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the settlement expense in fiscal included settlements with maxim for  of treasury stock  the state of florida for  and a  reimbursement to purchasers for prepaid premiums 
premium advances  net of reimbursements  in fiscal  and were   and a negative  respectively 
in fiscal  the allowance account for net premium advances was reduced 
for business goodwill  we make advances on policy premiums to maintain certain policies 
in the typical life settlement  policy premiums for the insured s projected life expectancy are added to the purchase price and those future premium amounts are set aside in an escrow account to pay future premiums 
when the future premium amounts are exhausted  purchasers are contractually obligated to pay the additional policy premiums 
in some instances  purchasers have failed to pay the premiums and we have repurchased the policy or advanced the premiums to maintain the policies 
while we have no contractual or other legal obligation to do so  and do not do so in every instance  we have made premium advances or purchased the policies as an accommodation to certain purchasers based on our assumptions that we will ultimately recoup the advances and upon our desire to preserve business goodwill 
while some purchasers repay the advances directly  reimbursements of these premiums will come most likely as a priority payment from the policy proceeds when an insured dies 
we must make estimates of the collectability of these premium advances 
we recorded an allowance against the premium advances at the time of the advance and treated reimbursements as a reduction of the allowance 
until fiscal  due to the uncertainty of the outcome of a court case with the state of texas  we were unable to estimate the amount of any future advances we may elect to make or the timing of the amount of reimbursements we were likely to receive 
within fiscal  issues were resolved that enabled us to better estimate the collectability of premium advances 
the agreement with the state of texas allowed us to specifically identify a class of investors for whom we made premium advances and which  under the terms of the agreement  will be uncollectible 
our historical success of collecting premium advances has enabled us to build a body of evidence by which we can demonstrate full collectability of the remaining balance of advanced premiums 
to date  we have ultimately been fully reimbursed when we have made an advance and the policy has matured 
as a result  we eliminated million of the allowance on the advanced premiums account in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income and expense interest and other income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest and other income decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily a result of  of gains on sales of investments in policies 
these gains were offset by a slight decrease in interest income as there was a lower amount of cash available for investment 
interest and other income in fiscal corresponded to lower interest rates on lower amounts of cash available for investment  as well as reduced gains from maturities on owned policies 
interest expense was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest expense in fiscal related primarily to the long term debt financing on our property  which was retired on april  there were gains from our investment in the life settlements trust in fiscal and  resulting in gains of  and  respectively 
realized loss on investments we realized a loss on sales of investment securities of  in fiscal  a gain of  in fiscal and a loss of  in fiscal income taxes the income tax benefit was  in fiscal as we had negative pretax earnings 
income tax expense decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income tax expense is in direct correlation to pretax earnings  taxed at at the federal level 
in fiscal  we had an additional accrual of  of texas margin tax   for an estimated assessment due to non deductibility of certain payments in past and current periods included in our calculation of the texas margin  and  for the current year taxes due in may income tax expense was also affected by the impact of establishing a  valuation allowance within the deferred income tax asset account 
this allowance was established to recognize the uncertainty of netting future capital gains against a current capital loss 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash flows used by operating activities in fiscal were  primarily as a result of a net loss of  a decrease in income taxes payable  a decrease in accounts payable and a gain on sales of investments in policies  while impairment of policies and deferred income taxes had a positive impact 
net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by  decreasing  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal fiscal s cash flow was primarily from net income of  and increased by impairment of owned policies and an increase in accounts payable 
fiscal s cash flow was primarily from net income of  increased by impairment of owned policies  impairment of investment in securities  an increase in accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable 
investing and financing activities our investing activities provided cash of  in fiscal  primarily from  of proceeds from sales of securities and  of proceeds from sales of investments in policies  less  used for purchases of investments in policies and  of net premium advances 
in contrast  we used cash of  in investing activities in fiscal versus  in fiscal we used available cash to purchase policy interests for our own account 
we purchased policies of  in fiscal and  in fiscal of the policies purchased in fiscal   represented policies that we acquired in connection with a settlement with the state of colorado 
we have continued to acquire policy interests on a discretionary basis as those opportunities are presented to us by existing clients and on terms that are agreeable to both parties 
we believe that we will profit from the investment in these policies when they mature 
we also used cash to make net premium advances  which were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we invested  in a life settlements trust  which acquired life settlement interests 
in addition to investing  we acted as a non exclusive purchasing agent for the trust and its predecessor partnership 
the trust is no longer acquiring life settlements and we do not anticipate further investments 
the trust owns a portfolio of life insurance settlements with an initial face value of million  which we anticipate will mature over the next few years 
the trust experienced some maturities during fiscal  and  which paid us   and  respectively 
sales of marketable securities were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  with purchases in fiscal resulting in a net source of  at february   we held  in marketable securities  compared to  at february  purchases of investment securities were  in in fiscal  we made purchases of property and equipment of  and in fiscal  we made purchases of property and equipment of  versus  in fiscal investments in certificates of deposit were in fiscal  in fiscal and zero in fiscal maturities of certificates of deposit were zero in fiscal and versus  in fiscal we used  in financing activities in fiscal  versus  in and  in fiscal financing activities in and were solely for dividends 
we paid dividends of  in fiscal  and we retired our long term debt at a cost of  working capital and capital availability as of february   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to  as of february  our cash during fiscal decreased by  compared to an increase in of  and an increase in fiscal of  our investments in marketable securities decreased by  from  at february   to  at february  while our working capital position remains relatively strong  the large drops in revenues  the significant legal and professional fees  and large operating losses have eroded the strength of our financial condition 
the sec suit has been highly damaging to our business  and we do not anticipate a recovery in our revenues and net income while the sec suit continues 
we are conserving our cash in anticipation that the suit will not be quickly resolved 
we have decreased our stock dividends and may make further cuts 
we are reducing our investments  including investments in policies 
we have eliminated executive and employee bonuses and are trimming general and administrative expense in other ways 
at this point  we believe we have more than sufficient cash and cash equivalents to support our short and long term operations 
we do not anticipate a need for future borrowings or stock sales 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions 
contractual obligations and commitments our outstanding contractual obligations and commitments as of february  were total due in less than year due in to years due in to years due after years operating leases     total obligations     item a
