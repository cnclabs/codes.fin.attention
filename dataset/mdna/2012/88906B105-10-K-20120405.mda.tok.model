product introductions during the first quarter of  we introduced tofutti jumbo and mini raviolis made with better than ricotta  our new non dairy ricotta cheese product 
we are currently developing additional frozen food items utilizing our various non dairy cheese products  though we have no planned introduction dates 
marketing and distribution tofutti products are sold and distributed across the united states and internationally  and can be found in gourmet specialty shops  kosher supermarkets  natural health food stores  and national and regional supermarket chains 
all of our products are sold by independent unaffiliated food brokers to distributors and sometimes on a direct basis to retail chain accounts 
food brokers act as our agents within designated territories or for specific accounts and receive commissions  which average of net collected sales 
certain key domestic accounts and all international accounts are handled directly by us 
our products are also sold in approximately twenty five other countries 
we currently sell our frozen dessert products in most major markets in the united states  including atlanta  baltimore  boston  charlotte  chicago  cincinnati  cleveland  dallas  denver  detroit  houston  kansas city  los angeles  miami  milwaukee  minneapolis  new york  orlando  philadelphia  phoenix  portland  richmond  san francisco  seattle  st 
louis  tampa and washington  dc we currently distribute all of our products by common carrier or by allowing customers to pick up products from outside storage facilities 
we do not own  lease or otherwise maintain any vehicles involved in the shipping of our products 
from our co packing facilities  we either ship direct to our customers or we ship to outside public storage facilities from which our customers are able to pick up products 
use of outside storage facilities in several key locations in the united states allows us to provide our customers with products in a timely fashion 
in addition to ice cream distributors  our products are handled by almost every major national and regional natural and or gourmet specialty distributor in the country 
we distribute our products through thirty distributors in the national health food market 
in certain situations  we also sell directly to several major supermarket chains who maintain their own warehouses 
our sales to health food distributors in fiscal decreased to approximately  or of total sales  as compared to approximately  or of total sales  in fiscal in fiscal  sales to trader joe s decreased to approximately  or of sales  as compared to approximately  or of sales in fiscal the reduction in sales to trader joe s  formerly our largest customer  was primarily due to the determination of trader joe s to cease selling branded goods 
our sales to the kosher market increased to approximately  or of sales  in fiscal  from sales of approximately  or of sales  in fiscal the following table presents the geographical breakdown of our sales in our largest domestic markets for the last two fiscal years 
fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended january  sales of total sales sales of total sales dollars in thousands california midwest metropolitan new york new england northwest mid atlantic florida rocky mountains southwest southeast upstate new york during fiscal  we shipped tofutti nondairy products to distributors in australia  brazil  canada  china  england  israel  mexico  panama and trinidad 
our distributor in england is our master distributor for all of europe and part of the middle east  excluding israel  and sells our products to approximately twenty other countries 
sales to foreign distributors increased to approximately  or of sales  in fiscal  as compared to approximately  or of sales  in fiscal we conduct all of our foreign business in us dollars 
therefore  our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the us dollar against local currencies  which could increase the local currency price of our products 
competition tofutti frozen desserts compete with all forms of ice cream products  yogurt based desserts and other soy based frozen desserts 
we believe that we are a leader in the nondairy frozen dessert product market and offer the most complete line of nondairy frozen dessert products 
other soy based frozen dessert products are presently being sold throughout the united states by established manufacturers  distributors of ice cream and other frozen dessert products 
the ice cream and frozen dessert industry is highly competitive and most companies with whom we compete are substantially larger and have significantly greater resources than us 
our other products also face substantial competition from both nondairy and dairy competitive products marketed by companies with significantly greater resources than we have 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively due to our ability to offer an array of non dairy frozen dessert and other food products that contain no butterfat  cholesterol or lactose and are milk free  yet offer the same texture and full bodied taste as their dairy counterparts 
product development all of our current products were developed internally in our own laboratory 
david mintz  our chief executive officer  devotes a substantial amount of his time and effort to new product development and product reformulation 
in fiscal and  our product development expenses were approximately  and  respectively 
these amounts do not include any portion of mr 
mintz s salary  and since they cannot be directly associated with any specific customers or products  they are considered part of operating expenses 
all product development costs are expensed as incurred 
production we believe that all of our products are produced under the strictest quality control procedures that are available in each manufacturing facility used by us 
these quality control procedures include  but are not limited to  the cleaning processes utilized prior to running our products  spot line inspections during production  in house laboratory testing as required by government agencies  supervision of all our production by our kosher supervisory service  and random testing by outside independent laboratories to ensure that our internal quality control procedures and guidelines are being properly followed 
all of our products are produced by co packers to whom we supply certain key ingredients and packaging for the manufacturing processes 
our co packing facilities are fully licensed and must comply with all state and federal laws and regulations 
we currently utilize seven co packers 
our co packers manufacture and package our products and  in certain instances  warehouse such products pending shipment 
for certain key product categories  such as nondairy frozen desserts and nondairy cheeses  we have more than one co packer 
in selecting an appropriate co packer  we take into account all of the preceding factors  plus cost considerations such as product processing fees and freight and warehouse expenses 
during the years ended december  and january   we purchased approximately and  respectively  of our finished goods from ice cream specialties  our primary frozen dessert novelty co packer and and of our finished goods  respectively  from franklin foods  our better than cream cheese and sour supreme co packer 
relationship with co packers we do not have any written production agreements with our co packers and do not anticipate that we would encounter any material difficulty in obtaining alternative production sources  at a comparable cost  if one or all of our co packers decide to terminate their relationships with us 
nevertheless  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company 
in order to protect our formulas  we have entered into confidentiality arrangements with our co packers and certain of their employees 
all of our employees  including officers  sign similar confidentiality agreements 
there can be no assurance that such confidentiality arrangements can or will be maintained  or that our trade secrets  know how and marketing ability cannot be obtained by others  or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities 
kosher certification kof k kosher supervision  or kof k  of teaneck  new jersey provides us with our kosher certification service 
before kof k will permit its certification  evidenced by its symbol  to be placed on a product  kof k must approve both the ingredients contained in the product and the facility processing the product 
approval of the manufacturing facilities we use include periodic inspections  and in most cases  on site supervision of actual production 
we believe that our ability to successfully market and distribute our products is dependent upon our continued compliance with the requirements of rabbinical certification 
all tofutti products meet the requirements for certification as kosher parve 
trademarks and patents we have registered our trademark  tofutti  and other trademarks for our frozen desserts and other products in the united states and approximately thirty five foreign countries 
we believe our trademarks are an important means of establishing consumer recognition for our products and we will vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of our trademarks 
we are not currently involved in any trademark litigation 
although we believe that our formulas and processes are proprietary  we have not sought patent protection for such technology 
instead  we are relying on the complexity of our technology  on trade secrecy laws and on confidentiality agreements 
we believe that our technology has been independently developed and does not infringe the patents of others 
government regulation companies engaged in the manufacture  packaging and distribution of food items are subject to extensive regulation by various government agencies which  pursuant to statutes  rules  and regulations  prescribe quality  purity  manufacturing and labeling requirements 
food products are often subject to standard of identity requirements  which are promulgated at either the federal or state level to determine the permissible qualitative and quantitative ingredient content of food 
to the extent that any product that we seek to market does not conform to an applicable standard  special permission to market such a product is required 
our united states product labels are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  or the fda 
such regulations include standards for product descriptions  nutritional claims  label format  minimum type sizes  content and location of nutritional information panels  nutritional comparisons  and ingredient content panels 
our labels  ingredients and manufacturing processes are subject to inspection by the fda 
we believe that we are in compliance with current labeling requirements and conduct periodic reviews to make certain that such compliance is on going 
the food  drug and cosmetic act  the food safety modernization act and rules and regulations promulgated by the fda thereunder  contain no specific federal standard of identity which is applicable to tofutti 
tofutti frozen dessert products meet the new york state standard of identity for parevine  which has been adopted by at least eight other states 
many states require registration and label review before food products can be sold 
while approval in one jurisdiction generally indicates the products will meet with approval in other jurisdictions  there is no assurance that approval from other jurisdictions will be forthcoming 
food manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by various safety  health and environmental regulatory authorities 
a finding of a failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in the imposition of sanctions including the closing of all or a portion of a company s facilities  subject to a period during which the company can remedy the alleged violations 
our cranford  new jersey facility is subject to inspection by the new jersey kosher enforcement bureau and the new jersey environmental health services 
we believe that we and our distributors and co packers are in compliance in all material respects with governmental regulations regarding our current products and have obtained the material governmental permits  licenses  qualifications and approvals required for our operations 
our compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws has not materially affected us either economically or in the manner in which we conduct our business 
however  there can be no assurance that our company  our distributors and our co packers will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in the future or that new governmental laws and regulations will not be introduced that could prevent or temporarily inhibit the development  distribution and sale of our products to consumers 
new government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscations  recalls or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
employees on december   we employed ten persons on a full time basis as compared to eight persons on a full time basis on january  we do not have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees 
item a 
risk factors 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in that case  the value of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we depend on a few key customers for a significant portion of our sales 
during the fiscal years ended december  and january   trader joe s accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
in  we were informed that trader joe s would no longer purchase our products as they determined to replace our products with their own private label substitutes 
we do not expect to record any sales to trader joe s in our failure to replace some of our historical trader joe s revenues could have a material adverse effect on our company 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales are to several key distributors  which are large distribution companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently 
such distributors as a group accounted for of our net sales for the fiscal year ended december  and of our net sales for the fiscal year ended january  in  one of our major distributors  tree of life  inc  was purchased by kehe food distributors  another of our major distributors 
although we believe that the business associated with any of our primary distributors can be readily transferred to other distributors or directly to supermarket warehouses if necessary  no assurance can be given that a change in distributors would not be disruptive to our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on several key suppliers to produce our products 
we do not produce any of our own products 
during the years ended december  and january   we purchased approximately and  respectively  of our finished goods from ice cream specialties  our primary frozen dessert novelty co packer and and of our finished goods  respectively  from franklin foods  our better than cream cheese and sour supreme co packer 
these producers are required to comply with fda regulations and federal and state agencies relating to the production of food products 
although we believe that there will be no problem in continuing to obtain finished goods from our current or alternative sources in the future  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company 
our business may be negatively affected by the current economic climate 
the current economic climate  and particularly the increased difficulty in securing credit  could impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products 
certain of our retail customers who have seen significant dampening of consumer demand  could face increased financial pressures that could impact their ability to purchase our products and make payments in a timely manner 
the continued high unemployment levels in the us and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis  will impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products 
a material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business 
we are a consumer food products company and rely on continued demand for our products 
to achieve business goals  we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers 
if demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses  our results could be negatively impacted 
this could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits 
our business faces cost pressures which could affect our business results 
our costs are subject to fluctuations  particularly due to changes in commodity prices  raw materials  cost of labor  foreign exchange and interest rates 
therefore  our success is dependent  in part  on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions  cost savings projects and sourcing decisions 
in the manufacturing and general overhead areas  we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements  including any key sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements 
economic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally 
worsening economic conditions  such as continued european sovereign debt uncertainty  may result in diminished demand for our products and in decreased sales volumes 
recessionary environments adversely affect the demand for our products as a result of constraints on discretionary spending by our retail customers 
in addition  this could result in longer sales cycles  slower acceptance of new products and increased competition for our products  which in turn could cause us to reduce prices for our products resulting in reduced gross margins 
any of these events would likely harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
natural disasters  terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business 
natural disasters  terrorist acts  acts of war  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology it security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our systems and operations  or the systems and operations of our contract manufacturers and distributors 
while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events  the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain 
the inability of our contract manufacturers or distributors to operate their facilities as a result of such events  even for a limited period of time  may result in significant expenses and or loss of market share to other competitors 
in addition  a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security could result in damage to our reputation 
any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in a competitive environment 
the frozen dessert and health food markets are highly competitive 
the ability to successfully introduce innovative products on a periodic basis that are accepted by the marketplace is a significant competitive factor 
in addition  many of our principal competitors are large  diversified companies with resources significantly greater than ours 
we expect strong competition to continue  including competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert category in supermarkets and other retail food outlets 
we rely on a limited number of key executives to manage our business 
our success is significantly dependent on the services of david mintz age  chief executive officer  and steven kass age  chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our principal shareholder has the ability to control the policies and management of our company 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david mintz  holds  shares of common stock representing approximately of the outstanding shares  permitting him to elect all members of the board of directors and thereby effectively control the business  policies and management of our company 
product liability suits  if brought  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
from time to time in the normal course of our business  we become subject to product liability claims 
if a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us  it could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us  or that we will be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products 
as a marketer of food products  we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability 
we maintain general product liability and umbrella insurance coverages and generally require that our co packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co insured 
similarly  most of our customers require us to name them as additional insureds as well  and in some cases we are required to sign hold harmless and indemnification agreements 
continuing need to introduce new products 
the successful introduction of innovative products on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to our sales growth 
accordingly  the future degree of market acceptance of any of our new products  which may be accompanied by significant promotional expenditures  is likely to have an important impact on our future financial results 
our operating results vary quarterly and seasonally 
we have often recognized a slightly greater portion of revenues in the second and third quarter of the year 
our expense levels are substantially based on our expectations for future revenues and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenue levels fall below expectations  our quarterly results are likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because a proportionately smaller amount of our expenses vary with our revenues 
we expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters  and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters  as a result of reduced sales of nondairy frozen desserts 
sales to our major customers fluctuate widely from period to period and there is no way to accurately predict that their sales pattern from one year will be repeated in the corresponding period of the next fiscal year 
due to the foregoing factors  in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of investors 
in such event  it is likely that the price of our common stock would be materially adversely affected 
the absence of patent protection could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely upon the confidentiality of our formulas and our know how rather than upon patent protection since patent protection may not be available for the recipes or manufacturing processes for any of our food products 
there is no assurance that such confidentiality can or will be maintained or that our know how cannot be obtained by others or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities 
the failure to maintain the confidentiality of our know how could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations 
in fiscal approximately of our revenues were from international sales 
although we continue to expand our international operations  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
to the extent that we cannot do so in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including the following the impact of possible recessionary environments in multiple foreign markets  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our foreign transactions are always in us dollars  and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
therefore  our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the us dollar  which could increase the local currency price of our products 
although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has not had a material adverse effect on our business  there can be no assurance such fluctuations in the future will not have a material adverse effect on revenues from international sales and  consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price is subject to volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  general market conditions in the industry  developments in the financial markets and other factors 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends 
our policy is to retain earnings  if any  for use in our business and  for this reason  we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our ordinary shares 
the sarbanes oxley act of imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors 
our efforts to comply with the requirements of section have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention  and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of resources 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to provide management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the filing of our annual report on form k for each fiscal year 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules 
if we continue to fail to maintain adequate internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities  and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  investor confidence in our reported financial information  and the market price of our ordinary shares

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when goods are shipped from our production facilities or outside warehouses and the following four criteria have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
we record as deductions against sales all trade discounts  returns and allowances that occur in the ordinary course of business  when the sale occurs 
to the extent we charge our customers for freight expense  it is included in revenues 
the amount of freight costs charged to customers has not been material to date 
accounts receivable 
the majority of our accounts receivables are due from distributors domestic and international and retailers 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are most often due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we determine whether an allowance is necessary by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the bad debt expense account 
we do not accrue interest on accounts receivable past due 
inventory 
inventory is stated at lower of cost or market determined by first in first out fifo method 
inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to the provision for inventories 
at the point of which loss is recognized  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established cost basis 
income taxes 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense 
we will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie  a likelihood greater than percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards updates that became effective after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended january  we operate on a fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december fiscal years for the financial statements included in this report are the fifty two week periods ended december  and the ended january  net sales for the fiscal year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for the fiscal year ended january  the reduction in sales was primarily due to the determination of trader joe s  our largest customer  to cease selling branded goods 
during fiscal  sales to trader joe s declined to  from  in fiscal  a reduction of  we also believe that we will recover some portion of these sales as our retail customers switch to other retail sources to purchase our products 
we believe our sales will improve during fiscal year due to the introduction of new products and price increases that will be instituted in the first two quarter of our gross profit in the year ended december  decreased by  to  reflecting the lower level of sales 
our gross profit percentage for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended january  this decrease in gross profit percentage was due to an increase in certain material and packaging costs in the period compared to the period 
freight out expense increased to  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended january  while the actual dollar cost of freight increased slightly in  its cost as a percentage of sales increased from in to in due to the expected high cost of fuel  we anticipate that our freight cost as a percentage of sales will approximate the percentages should fuel costs remain steady 
our gross profit was also impacted by price increases for certain key ingredients and packaging costs 
we have begun to implement price increases for some of our products  which we expect will help improve our profit margin in selling and warehousing expenses decreased by  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease was caused primarily by a  decrease in outside warehouse rental expense  a  decrease in payroll expense  and a  decrease in commission expense 
the reduction in payroll expense was primarily due to no provisions for bonuses in fiscal these decreases were offset by increases in bad debt expense of  meetings and convention expense of  and messenger and courier expense of  the increase in bad debt expense was due primarily to an increase in the reserve for bad debts for certain accounts 
we anticipate that with the exception of commission expenses and outside warehouse rental expense  which are variable to sales  all other selling expenses in should remain relatively consistent with our expenses in marketing expenses increased slightly in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal increases in public relations expense of  artwork and plates expense of  and promotion expense of  were offset by a decrease in advertising expense of  we expect marketing expenses to remain close to the same level in fiscal product development expenses decreased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was caused primarily by a decrease in payroll costs of  and lab and supplies expense of  which were offset by an increase in professional fees and outside services of  we expect that product development costs in will remain consistent with fiscal costs 
general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in payroll expense 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in real and personal property tax expense of  professional fees and outside services expense of  it expense of  and public relations expense of  the reduction in payroll expense was due primarily due to the decision to not pay bonuses to our executive officers in fiscal while in fiscal such bonuses amounted to  in the aggregate 
in connection with such decision  we stopped accruing amounts for bonuses in the third quarter of and management intends to review this determination later in we anticipate that professional fees and outside services  which include legal and accounting fees  will increase in fiscal primarily due to the costs associated with the mandatory implementation of the requirement to file our financial reports with the securities and exchange commission in xbrl extensible business reporting language 
our management expects that general and administrative expenses in will remain consistent with fiscal expenses 
overall  total operating expenses in fiscal decreased to  a decrease of  or  from total operating expenses in fiscal income before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal  primarily as a result of our lower revenues and gross profit  which was partially offset by the reduction in operating expenses 
income taxes for the fiscal period were  compared to  in fiscal  and our income tax rate was for the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the increase in the income tax rate for fiscal was due to the effect of certain deferred income tax expense items 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  and our working capital was  an increase of  from january  our current and quick acid test ratios  both measures of liquidity  were and  respectively  at december  compared to and  respectively  at january  at december   our accounts receivable increased by  to  from january   reflecting the aging of certain accounts at year end 
the average number of days outstanding for accounts receivable in fiscal was days as compared to days in fiscal at december   our inventories decreased to  from  at january  the decrease in our inventories is due both to a reduction in sales and the discontinuation of a number of slower moving products  along with their ingredient and packaging inventories 
refundable and deferred income taxes increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at december  due to the reclassification of tax assets 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by  to  at december   from  at january   reflecting no provision for bonuses in fiscal our board of directors first instituted a share repurchase program in september which  after several amendments  has to date authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices 
while we may purchase an additional  shares of common stock based on such authorization  we did not purchase any shares of our common stock from the first quarter of fiscal until december during december  we repurchased  shares at a cost of  we repurchased an additional  shares in january and february at a cost of  cumulatively  from the beginning of our share repurchase program  we have purchased  shares at a cost of  cash flows fiscal year ended december  january  in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year cash used in operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended december  compared with cash provided by operating activities of  for the fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal year ended december   our cash flow from operating activities reflected net income of  a  increase in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventories  a  increase in prepaid expenses  and a  decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we used  in financing activities in the fiscal year ended december  for the repurchase of common stock  compared to used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended january  as a result of the foregoing  our cash and cash equivalents decreased to  at december  from  at january we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   and the cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to support our operating and capital requirements during the next twelve months 
contractual obligations we have no contractual obligations at december  inflation and seasonality we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding two years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future 
our business is subject to minimal seasonal variations with slightly increased sales historically in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
we expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters  and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters  as a result of reduced sales of nondairy frozen desserts during those periods 
market risk we will invest our excess cash  should there be any  in highly rated money market funds which are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we do not believe that our foreign currency exposure is significant as our export sales are transacted in us dollars 
we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts in the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangements none
