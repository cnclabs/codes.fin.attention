item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
we believe we have achieved a leadership position in high performance semiconductor materials  materials packaging  and materials delivery systems for the microelectronics market by focusing on providing solutions to our customers that allow them to make faster  more advanced  or less expensive devices while improving their manufacturing asset productivity and production yields 
we also focus on partnering with customers to bring new technologies into high volume production as quickly and efficiently as possible 
atmi plans to continue to focus on leveraging our core technologies to create new high growth product lines  including growing our leadership position in advanced interconnect applications  which today is focused on copper 
we believe we also have achieved a leadership position in the small but fast growing market for one time use mixing and bioreactor applications in the life sciences market 
in the first half of  driven by the challenging repercussions of global credit and financial market disruptions which caused an economic downturn  our customers cautiously managed their inventories 
in the second half of  macroeconomic indicators began to recover driven by customers who had reduced their inventory levels earlier in the year and government sponsored demand generation programs 
however  unemployment levels remained at historically high levels in the us  europe and certain other parts of the world  which caused continued economic uncertainty 
in  we have seen periods of increasing momentum and then contraction as our customers respond to the global macroeconomic cycles 
through the first half of our quarterly sequential revenue continued to improve  but in the second half of  global economic conditions began to soften as customers managed inventories in the face of continued uncertainty 
atmi s operations comprise one operating business segment 
atmi s strategy atmi s strategic intent is to be the source of process efficiency solutions to technology driven customers by providing innovative materials and related delivery systems and technologies to focus development and application engineering initiatives with the leading manufacturers to provide next generation performance materials and process solutions  target high growth  high margin specialty markets that use atmi s core materials and packaging technologies and require products that are consumed in the production process  add value through performance materials packaging  dispensing  and process technologies designed to meet the demands of users for greater levels of purity  productivity  safety  environmental responsiveness  and speed  significantly shorten new product development time lines and the development of next generation materials through the use of a combinatorial science based research approach and hpd capabilities  
table of contents leverage atmi s technology leadership by investing extensively to develop proprietary and patented materials and process solutions  which the company uses to quickly commercialize new offerings for customers  and form strategic alliances  including joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts  to accelerate the introduction of atmi s products into existing and new markets 
in summary  atmi s strategy does not encompass a traditional materials supplier to customer relationship 
in those relationships  suppliers tend to provide materials to customers based solely on the cost  quantity  and quality of the materials being supplied 
instead  atmi works to develop partnerships with its customers based on our ability to improve the process efficiency of customers development  scale up  manufacturing and supply chain processes  thereby reducing customers total cost of ownership 
atmi seeks to provide value to its customers through the use of its technical capabilities  and applications knowledge in a manner that changes its commercial relationship with those customers to a value sharing relationship 
microelectronics products and processes atmi believes it is among the most innovative suppliers of high purity materials and related delivery systems and technologies 
products serving the integrated circuit ic fabrication market represent the largest portion of atmi s business and development activities 
the principal drivers for this market are cost  yield  speed  utilization of capital  and risk reduction 
the success of an electronic component or device is driven by the increased functionality it can deliver at a lower cost 
yield and capital utilization are significant drivers for the ic industry due to the implications on throughput and financial return  and the challenge is compounded by the requirement to manufacture devices for increasingly complex advanced technology generations 
in an industry where the capital infrastructure is significant and product life cycles are short  the ability to bring the next generation technology rapidly to market can make a significant difference in our customers success 
atmi s ability to shorten deployment of production ready solutions is critical to our success 
high productivity development 
atmi uses utilizes combinatorial science based methods for materials discovery  unit process development and device integration in support of our customers needs to develop new materials in response to the challenges of decreasing node sizes 
our experience in materials development and packaging combined with these capabilities bring the unique ability to provide massively parallel experimentation for materials screening  process window characterization  device integration and performance optimization 
collaborative arrangements 
in  atmi entered into a collaborative development agreement cda with an advanced memory integrated circuit manufacturer for the purpose of developing molecules  including chemical precursors  and material systems for next generation semiconductor products 
atmi will use its hpd platform to collaboratively work with this customer on specific statements of work designed to develop next generation materials and is currently working with other customers negotiating similar types of arrangements 
ion implantation 
the primary issues for ic manufacturers are production throughput  cost  and safety because of the hazardous properties of the implant gases used 
atmi s patented sds solutions use a standard gas cylinder containing an adsorbent material 
the cylinder is filled with gas under conditions such that the gas is adsorbed onto the adsorbent material at sub atmospheric pressure 
sub atmospheric storage of hazardous gases minimizes potential leaks of gas during transportation and use  thus providing significant safety and environmental improvements over traditional high pressure cylinders 
in addition  sds products allow more process gas to be stored in the cylinder  providing significantly higher rates of productivity than traditional methods of gas delivery used in ion implantation manufacturing processes 
these advantages have led the majority of significant chip manufacturers to adopt this technology as the industry standard for dopant gas delivery 
materials packaged in sds systems include primarily arsine  phosphine  and boron trifluoride 
the third generation of sds products  called sds  maintains all the inherent safety features of previous generation sds products  but dramatically increases the gas storage capacity by using a new adsorbent 
the two to three times capacity improvement over the previous sds products allows ion implanter users to reduce tool down time  resulting in significant cost savings for our customers 
copper integration 
atmi believes it is a market leader in copper electroplating materials and processes in semiconductor development and manufacturing with our viaform product  which includes inorganic and proprietary organic molecules that provide the wiring for copper interconnects allowing manufacturers to eliminate processing steps 
atmi also focuses on the total copper integration scheme with post chemical mechanical planarization cmp cleaning solutions developed using our hpd capability  which uses knowledge rich  combinatorial science experiments to deliver the best possible solution 
one such outcome is planarclean  a new post cmp cleaning solution which is part of our surface preparation product line 
deposition 
several processes for depositing thin films such as chemical vapor deposition cvd and atomic layer deposition ald processes are enabled by advanced liquid  gaseous and solid precursors 
atmi s ultrapur brand of materials provides solutions for pre metal dielectric  dielectric and barrier applications 
atmi is well positioned for the incorporation of ald processes 
table of contents by the semiconductor industry with its proe vap ampoule 
this proprietary container allows for reliable delivery of low volatility solid precursors required for processes that demand ald  like high k gates 
atmi has successfully adopted the carbon adsorption technology used in sds and introduced products for semiconductor deposition processes marketed under the sage brand 
these applications include low k plasma enhanced deposition  or pe cvd  processes using low k materials  pre metal dielectric high density plasma  or hdp cvd  and films using phosphine gases and thermal deposition processes using germane gases 
surface preparation 
atmi s st and ap photoresist strip cleaning materials are proprietary chemistries used for applications such as semiconductor post etch residue removal  wafer etching  organics removal  negative resist removal  edge bead removal  and corrosion prevention 
materials packaging 
atmi s nowpak liner technologies and container assemblies form the basis for its high purity liquid materials packaging and dispensing system product portfolio for applications in ic fabrication and flat panel display 
this product line includes the bag in a bottle and bag in a can container systems which have their own companion dispense connection systems 
each package features a pre cleaned collapsible inner liner  or bag  inside a rugged  high density polyethylene overpack 
the standard liner films are made of polytetrafluoroethylene and other polymers  which allow chemicals to be delivered to the manufacturing process without compromising their inherent purity 
the empty inner liner is easily removed for waste consolidation  and the outer shell is recyclable or returnable for insertion of a new replacement liner 
the dispensing system promotes full use of the chemical  chemical isolation from environmental contamination  and improved safety during dispense by sealing and isolating the chemical from the environment to further protect the chemical and the operator 
life sciences products atmi is addressing an increasing number of critical materials handling needs for the life sciences markets 
other markets for our proprietary high purity materials handling and dispensing systems include the biotechnology  laboratory and cell therapy markets  which we believe offer significant growth potential 
the biotechnology industry has been using disposable components like filters  connectors  and disposable storage bags for several years  however  biotechnology customers have a growing need to combine these disposable components and integrate them into disposable systems 
atmi has responded to this trend by launching a complete offering of scalable disposable containment  dispensing  mixing and bioreactor systems 
atmi s integrity line of proprietary disposable mixing technology is the market leading technology for disposable mixing applications within the life sciences market 
the solutions delivered to our customers consist of a hardware system that is compatible with a one time use mixing bag container  the technology delivers unique particle free mixing and is scalable to an industrial scale 
a typical biotech manufacturing process has over different mixing steps starting from a cell culture process through the final fill drug solutions 
atmi mixing technology is typically used for preparing buffers and media solutions for feeding the cell culture and chromatography applications  but also other process steps like virus inactivation and final fill solutions 
in november  we acquired the belgian biotechnology firm artelis sa  an innovator in the area of highly efficient bioprocesses and technologies for cell therapy research and manufacturing scale up 
the acquisition complements atmi s leadership in ultra pure single use films  bioreactors  and mixing systems for characterizing  developing  and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals and extends our global capabilities to a broad range of biopharmaceutical process expertise 
raw materials we use a broad range of specialty and commodity chemicals and polymers in the development of our products  including parts and sub assemblies that are obtained from outside suppliers 
we seek  where possible  to have several sources of supply for all of these materials 
although we may  in some instances  rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers  or upon suppliers in a single country  for certain of these materials  we have not experienced any sustained interruption in production or the supply of these materials and do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the materials necessary to manufacture our products 

table of contents working capital in the ordinary course of our business  we maintain an adequate level of working capital at all times to support business needs 
in accordance with microelectronics  flat panel display and life sciences industry practices  we do not need to carry significant amounts of finished goods inventory to meet the delivery requirements of our customers 
we generally do not provide customers with rights of return with the exception of standard warranty provisions  which historically have not been material and we generally do not provide customers extended payment terms beyond days

table of contents competition atmi s primary competitors in the semiconductor materials product lines include air products and chemicals electronics division  dupont electronic technologies  dow chemical company including rohm and haas  basf and air liquide as well as several smaller companies that specialize in niche markets 
atmi s sds products using adsorbent based delivery technology face competition from praxair  inc  and others  who have a mechanical based product approach to delivering gas at sub atmospheric pressure which currently comprise a small portion of the market 
several companies compete with high pressure gas cylinders and solid sources 
there are numerous domestic and foreign companies that offer products that compete with atmi s materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems 
atmi believes that its ability to compete in the markets for containers and dispensing systems is dependent largely upon its patented nowpak technology and its proven ability to enhance and improve its products and technologies 
our nowpak product line primarily competes with glass bottle manufacturers 
atmi s primary competitors in the life sciences product line include sartorius stedim biotech sa  thermo scientific hyclone  inc  merck millipore  and xcellerex 
atmi competes in established markets based on our ability to innovate and on product performance  process efficiency  safety and price 
in new and emerging markets we compete based on our ability to develop innovative products that fulfill new and changing customer needs in an efficient  cost effective manner 
increased competition has  and may continue to  affect the prices we are able to charge for our products 
in addition  our competitors could own or could obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
research and development the company s r d expenses consist of personnel and other direct and indirect costs for internally funded project development  including the use of outside service providers 
atmi also participates in joint development efforts with several key semiconductor manufacturers  advanced technology developers  and semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
total expenses for r d for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
total research and development expenditures represented percent  percent  and percent of revenues in  and  respectively 
atmi has made significant investments to create global hpd capabilities that incorporate high productivity combinatorial science based research tools to shorten the new product development life cycle and more rapidly create new materials needed by our customers for their advanced technology roadmaps 
while conventional r d methods allow for one process experiment to be conducted on a single wafer  hpd capabilities enable engineers to evaluate up to different test chemistries on a wafer at once 
this technique allows independent control of formulation  stir rate and exposure time at each independent site on a test surface  yielding a rich source of data regarding materials choices in a fraction of the time and at lower cost than conventional research methods 
beyond the improvements in speed and data quality during the evaluation period  results are also subjected to both automated and human experience driven understanding of semiconductor manufacturing process flows 
the union of these forces produces much faster learning cycles  and makes it possible to rapidly narrow substantial volumes of data to a most promising subset of chemical formulations 
the process is iterative  concurrently assessing large numbers of precisely selected  newly designed test variations 
since production of the earliest integrated circuits ics  a readily identifiable group of the same dielectrics  dopants and metals were applied with only limited refinements or modifications 
the introduction of copper has changed that dynamic  now  virtually every new technology generation requires no fewer than a dozen new materials 
looking into the future  the industry evolution to nanometer will encompass approximately new materials in a process involving nearly  steps  dramatically increasing the need to have a capability which enables more rapid feedback for the determination of materials that would be appropriate for individual processes 
there is a significant and growing need among our customers to have access to hpd capabilities to enable them to keep pace with these market changes 
the fundamental obstacle to overcome in trying to develop optimal chemistries in this environment is that conducting experiments in the conventional serial fashion will not produce answers rapidly enough to meet technology node insertion deadlines or competitive needs 
our hpd capabilities allow us to pursue more new product opportunities  in a shorter time  and using fewer resources compared to previous methods 
by performing a higher rate of experiments and identifying promising routes for integrating these materials in actual production flows  and in certain instances  learning about device characteristics  including electrical performance  much earlier in the process than traditional approaches should differentiate atmi s materials development capabilities from our competition 
we have demonstrated reductions in cycle time of up to percent in the development of certain customer solutions 
we are currently using our hpd capabilities to solve customers materials challenges in applications such as post cmp cleaning  high dose implant strip  copper post etch residue removal  advanced precursors  high k metal gate cleaning and others all areas that pose substantial development hurdles for our customers in the race to transition to the next technology node 

table of contents strategic alliances atmi forms strategic alliances  including joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts  to develop new products and to accelerate the introduction of its products 
these programs have led to significant technological advances  including the development of proprietary advanced materials and semiconductor manufacturing processes 
in october  atmi terminated its exclusive license  manufacture  and distribution agreement with matheson  whereby atmi had granted licensing rights for the manufacturing and worldwide distribution of certain sds products to matheson 
following a transition period of up to two years  atmi will manufacture sds products for worldwide distribution 
atmi has a strategic alliance with enthone  inc enthone  a subsidiary of cookson electronics  pursuant to which atmi purchased the exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights to enthone s copper ecd products  including its viaform products  through  subject to automatic renewal upon satisfaction of certain conditions

we have an equity interest in green lyon group  inc  a united states company that is developing technology for the recycling of printed circuit boards 
these programs enhance atmi s core technology base and promote the introduction of targeted products 
backlog substantial portions of our business are conducted with open ended supply contracts and or consignment agreements that do not specify quantities 
also  the sds gas delivery source product carries no backlog 
therefore  the company does not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 
patents and proprietary rights atmi has made  and continues to make  a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for its technology and products 
atmi seeks to protect its technology by  among other things  filing patent applications where appropriate 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation  and licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain its competitive position 
as of december   atmi owns or controls approximately united states patents and has approximately current united states patent applications pending 
foreign counterparts of certain of these applications have been filed  or may be filed at an appropriate time

table of contents item a 
risk factors cautionary statements regarding future results of operations you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings 
these cautionary statements are intended to highlight material factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
like other companies  we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers 
similarly  the price of our common stock is subject to volatility because of fluctuations in general market conditions  differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community  and other factors beyond our control 
our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors 
our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors  including price reductions  decreases in our shipment volume  reductions in  or obsolescence of  our inventory and shifts in our product mix 
many of our expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are fixed in the short term 
accordingly  reduced demand for our products and services can cause our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes  which can adversely affect our gross margin and profitability  and reduced demand could adversely affect our performance 
our ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base 
cyclicality in the markets we sell to may adversely affect our performance 
the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases or decreases in demand 
these changes  along with cyclical changes in the flat panel display market  could adversely affect our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our results of operations have been adversely affected  and may be further affected in the future  if demand for semiconductors  or devices that use semiconductors  or flat panels decreases or grows at a significantly slower pace than has historically occurred 
subsequent upturns in the markets which we serve have historically been characterized by sudden increased product demand and production capacity constraints 
we may have difficulty reacting quickly enough to a sudden upturn in demand for our products and may incur significant expediting and manufacturing costs to meet a rapid increase in customer demand 
the recent global economic crisis and continuing uncertainty in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in the second half of  we began to see indications of industry recovery from the global credit and financial market disruptions that began in late and continued into  which caused customers to reduce their inventory levels in the face of the economic downturn and government sponsored demand generation programs 
as the recovery gained momentum  our quarterly sequential revenues improved into the first half of  however  as we saw with the decline in wafer starts in the second half of  and the global economic uncertainty  particularly in the european economic community  until the general global economy demonstrates marked improvement in the form of consistent growth  uncertainties will continue to affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers  distributors or customers could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
similarly  the price of our common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions  differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community  and other factors beyond our control 
on an ongoing basis  our business may be affected by economic down turns which could impact the volatility and liquidity of financial and credit markets  the general global economy  and factors such as inflationary or deflationary pressures yielding other market or economic challenges 
there can be no assurance that there will not be deterioration in credit and financial markets affecting consumer confidence in economic conditions 
our business could be adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others 
our proprietary technology supports our ability to compete effectively with other companies 
although we have been awarded  have filed applications for or have been licensed under numerous patents in the united states and other countries  these patents may not fully protect our technology or competitive position 
further  our competitors may apply for and obtain patents that will restrict our ability to make and sell our products 

table of contents our competitors may intentionally infringe our patents 
third parties may also assert infringement claims against us in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how  to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits are both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
outside the united states  in particular  such proceedings can be extremely expensive and their outcome very unpredictable 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could cause us to lose proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to license rights from third parties or to cease selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology that others may independently develop or otherwise obtain access to 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies could negatively affect our revenues and earnings 
the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
while we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide  in  approximately percent of our revenues were generated by customers 
the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers  including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations 
our customers and their customers aggressive management of inventory has already adversely affected our results of operations in the past and may continue to adversely affect future results of operations 
customer driven pricing pressure may adversely affect our average selling prices 
we face aggressive cost containment pressures from our customers 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain current prices in the face of continuing pricing pressures 
over time  the average price for our products may decline as the markets for these products become more competitive 
any material reduction in product prices could negatively affect both revenues and profits 
our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected if we cannot anticipate market trends  enhance our existing products and processes  develop and commercialize new products and processes  and identify and consummate strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends  to enhance our existing products and processes  to develop and commercialize new products and processes  and to expand through selected acquisitions of technologies or businesses or other strategic alliances 
the microelectronics industry markets we serve undergo frequent technological changes  which in turn create demand for new and improved products and process technologies 
we may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies or to develop and market new products and technologies that will be cost effective or introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace 
we may not be able to leverage our knowledge to make full use of combinatorial science and hpd capabilities as an effective market offering for our customers 
our failure to develop or introduce enhanced and new products and processes in a timely manner may negatively affect our revenues and earnings  and result in a potential impairment of assets 
management considers  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses and other strategic alliances  some of which may be material to us 
however  we cannot be assured that we will identify or succeed in consummating transactions with suitable acquisition candidates or alliance partners in the future 
we may have difficulty obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other aspects of our business  which could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 
we have hundreds of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business  and we seek  where possible  to have several sources of supply for all of these materials 
however  we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers  or upon suppliers in a single country  for certain of these materials 
the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of reasonable quality production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production process 
in addition  production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as electricity  chemicals  and gases 
the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources 
our life sciences business is also subject to governmental approval for products that are part of the manufacture of pharmaceuticals 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents we face intense competition from a variety of sources  including larger companies 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
a number of domestic and international companies engage in commercial activities in the markets we serve 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  as these industries evolve  other competitors may emerge 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in and focus upon research and development and product and process innovation 
we may not be successful if we cannot compete on price  technical capabilities  quality  or customer service 
our global manufacturing and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal  political  economic or other changes 
we have facilities in eight countries worldwide and  in  approximately percent of our revenues came from sales to companies outside the united states 
the global nature of our business and the significance of our foreign operations expose us to certain risks in the countries in which we operate  including political and economic instability  the adequacy of country infrastructure and labor resources  currency fluctuations and controls  compliance with foreign laws and intellectual property protection  changes in export controls  health conditions  and possible disruptions in transportation networks  which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchanges rates 
given our current operations and large customer base outside the united states  we employ the use of forward currency exchange contracts to attempt to minimize the potentially adverse earnings effect from exchange rate fluctuations on our net balance sheet exposures 
nevertheless  in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non us currencies in which we transact business  such as the euro  japanese yen  the south korean won  and the new taiwan dollar  fluctuations can have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by climate change and natural events in the locations in which we  our customers or our suppliers operate 
we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations 
in addition  our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations 
a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations  or our customers or suppliers operations  may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
also  climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses 
incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered may affect our ability to meet our forecasts 
in addition  when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers demands 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  we may incur expedited shipping costs to deliver products to meet customer demand or hold excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth and attracting and retaining highly skilled scientific  technical  managerial and marketing personnel  which could adversely affect our revenues and increase our operating expenses 
we have historically experienced periods of growth and intend to grow our business in the future 
the management of our growth requires qualified personnel  systems and other resources 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific  technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the industries that we serve is intense  and our competitors are often larger and more established than we are 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
in addition  our expansion may also significantly strain operational  management  financial  sales and marketing and other resources 
to manage growth effectively  we must continue to enhance and integrate our information technology infrastructure  systems and controls and successfully expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage this expansion effectively  including by providing satisfactory levels of customer service and technical support 
inability to manage our growth and to attract and retain skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we engage in business combinations and asset acquisitions  and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our current operations  therefore  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
we seek to grow  in part  through strategic business combinations and asset acquisitions 
in the past several years  we have made certain acquisitions intended to complement and expand our business  and may continue to do so in the future 
the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions  apply our internal controls to these acquired businesses  and cooperate with our strategic partners 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations  applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions  and in managing strategic investments 
we may also have difficulty in integrating and managing new it environments 
furthermore  we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in  we terminated the license  manufacturing  and distribution agreements for our proprietary sds and vac products sds direct transaction 
to achieve the anticipated benefits of this transaction requires a transition period with the former license  manufacturing  and distribution partner 
it will also require a certain amount of capital spending associated with expanding our manufacturing facilities and obtaining new business licenses and permits in certain countries 
we may have difficulty transitioning responsibilities away from the former partner of our sds and vac products causing the transition to be more expensive than anticipated  or potentially causing business interruptions 
we may also encounter issues in obtaining the necessary licenses and permits in certain countries making it difficult to achieve the full revenue and cash flow benefits of this transaction in a timely manner 
we face the risk of product liability claims 
the manufacture and sale of our products  which include thin film  other toxic materials and packages for life sciences applications  involve the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer 
our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us 
we may be subject to information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security from cyber attacks could disrupt our operations causing customer communication and order management issues  unintentional disclosure of customer  employee and proprietary information  and disruption in transaction processing which could affect our reputation and reporting of financial results 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security  hiring competent personnel and establishing prudent internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our business is potentially subject to substantial liabilities for failure to comply with environmental regulations 
we use  generate and discharge toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals and waste in our manufacturing  processing and research and development activities 
as a result  we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
our failure to comply with present or future laws could result in fines or other liabilities being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
in addition  under federal and state statutes and regulations  a government agency may seek to recover its response costs and or require future remedial measures from both operators and owners of property where releases of hazardous substances may have occurred including releases by prior occupants or are ongoing  and for which only partial indemnification may be available in some cases 
our activities may also result in our being subject to additional regulation 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with environmental laws 
our failure to control the use of hazardous substances could subject us to substantial financial liabilities 
our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters 
generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business  such as revenue recognition  business combinations  asset impairment  inventories  fair value measurements  self insurance  tax matters and litigation  are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition 

table of contents our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in taxation 
because we are a multi national company  we have a business presence in many countries and  as a result  are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities 
tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries  or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 
in addition  we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction 
changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income  which could in turn affect our results of operations 
we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets  which could also affect our results of operations 
each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year 
if that performance forecast changes  our forecasted tax liability may change 
compliance with changing corporate governance regulations and public disclosures may result in additional risks and exposures 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  and new regulations from the sec  have created uncertainty for public companies such as ours 
one such example is the current ambiguity regarding the breadth and pace of adoption of ifrs whether by convergence or sec mandate 
these laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices and our commitment to maintaining high standards with regard thereto 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations  and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased selling  general  and administrative expenses and significant management time and attention 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment and  our independent registered public accounting firm s audit  for fiscal have necessitated  and we expect such efforts to continue to necessitate  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we are also monitoring the evolving establishment of sec rules in compliance with the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act to determine the potential future effect on our disclosures and shareholders rights

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
company overview we believe we are among the leading suppliers of high performance materials  materials packaging and materials delivery systems used worldwide in the manufacture of microelectronics devices 
our products consist of front end semiconductor performance materials  sub atmospheric pressure gas delivery systems for safe handling and delivery of toxic and hazardous gases to semiconductor process equipment  high purity materials packaging and dispensing systems that allow for the reliable introduction of low volatility liquids and solids to microelectronics and biopharmaceutical processes 
atmi targets both semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers  whose products form the foundation of microelectronics technology rapidly proliferating through the consumer products  information technology  automotive  and communications industries 
the market for microelectronics devices is continually changing  which drives demand for new products and technologies at lower cost 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in the world who target leading edge technologies 
atmi also addresses an increasing number of critical materials handling needs for the life sciences markets 
our proprietary containment  mixing  and bioreactor technologies are sold to the biotechnology  laboratory and cell therapy markets  which we believe offer significant growth potential 
atmi s objective is to meet the demands of our microelectronics and life sciences customers with solutions that maximize the efficiency of their manufacturing processes  reduce capital or operating costs  and minimize the time to develop new products and integrate them into their processes 
use of estimates preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by atmi s audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon delivery to a common carrier when terms are equivalent to free on board fob origin and upon receipt by a customer when terms are equivalent to fob destination 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied  except when reasonable reserves for returns can be effectively established due to substantial successful installation history for homogenous transactions 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we accrue for sales returns  warranty costs  and other allowances based on a current evaluation of our experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
prior to october   we used matheson as our exclusive contract manufacturer and distribution partner for the manufacture and distribution of our sds products the licensed products 
under the terms of the original manufacturing agreement  atmi retained the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products  while matheson had the right to manufacture percent of all licensed products 
upon completion of manufacture  atmi purchased all licensed products produced by matheson 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  we received payment from matheson based upon a formula which was dependent on the sale price obtained by matheson from its customers 
atmi recognized revenue from the sale of licensed products to matheson when matheson sold the licensed products to its customers  because that is when the sales price became fixed and determinable 
on october   we terminated the agreements with matheson for manufacturing  marketing  selling and distributing of our sds products 
matheson will provide ongoing support services to atmi during a brief transition period  and will continue to manufacture a portion of the sds products for up to two years  for which it will be paid additional fees by atmi 
subject to such continuing services  atmi assumed control of all manufacturing  distribution  logistics and sales services  which matheson had provided globally prior to execution of the termination agreement  other than the distribution of the sds and vac product lines in japan  which services will continue to be provided by matheson s parent company  taiyo nippon sanso corporation tnsc 
in those regions where matheson is involved in distributing products during the transition period  revenues will be recognized only after sale of the licensed products to the end users 

table of contents accounts receivable allowances the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of the markets we operate in and the financial viability of specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends  we assess the financial health of the markets we operate in and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing reviews of account balances and aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended 
write offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates because of unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks surrounding specific customers 
as of december  and we had million of accounts receivable allowances recorded 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any adverse changes in market conditions may require us to record additional reserves 
inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are established in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated balance sheets 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventory cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts or chemicals meet current specifications and cannot be substituted for or reworked into a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of inventory valuation reserves recorded 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any adverse changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves 
non marketable equity securities we selectively invest in non marketable equity securities of private companies  which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an atmi product or initiative 
our non marketable equity investments are recorded using cost basis or the equity method of accounting  depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment 
at december   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities totaled million million at december  
the main driver of the reduction from december  was the initial public offering of intermolecular  which caused us to reclassify our investment from other non current assets to marketable securities because the securities became publicly traded 
in certain instances  we loan funds to early stage investees at market interest rates to enable them to focus on product and technology development 
non marketable equity and debt securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other non current assets 
we receive regular financial information from our investee s typically on a one month lag 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  attracting and retaining talented professionals  and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis may require significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 

table of contents investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its fair value  using the framework required by accounting standards codification asc fair value measurements and disclosures 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recognized an million impairment charge in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities in none in and 
income taxes the net deferred tax asset at december  was million compared to a net deferred tax liability of million at december  driven by the million benefit from the million contract termination charge associated with the sds direct transaction 
for our deferred future tax benefits  we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
for a discussion of current tax matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in a business combination and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment atmi s net property  plant and equipment at december  and was million and million  respectively  representing percent and percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated total assets 
depreciation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors  including historical experience with similar assets and technological life cycles 
circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly 
the depreciation periods used are buildings  to years  machinery and equipment  to years  software  to years  cylinders and canisters  to years  furniture and fixtures  years  and leasehold improvements  over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life 
we use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 

table of contents equity based compensation we account for awards of equity based compensation under our employee stock plans using the fair value method 
accordingly  we estimate the grant date fair value of our equity based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currently use the black scholes merton options pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of equity based awards on the date of grant using an options pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
management is required to make certain judgments for these variables which include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of options based on employee exercise behaviors  and the risk free interest rate 
for awards granted subsequent to january   expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of atmi common stock for a period shorter than the expected term of the options 
we have excluded the historical stock price volatility prior to the public announcement regarding the sale of our non core businesses in  because those businesses that were sold represented a significant portion of atmi s consolidated business and were subject to considerable cyclicality associated with the semiconductor equipment industry  which drove increased volatility in atmi s stock price 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected term 
we recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions  in future periods  the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
equity based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight line or accelerated attribution basis over the estimated service period of the awards 
fair value measurements all of our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value based upon level or level inputs  as defined under asc  with the exception of one auction rate security  which has been measured using level inputs  because the security is illiquid 
for level measurements  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
for level measurements  we use observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
for level measurements  we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the calculation of fair value for our auction rate security requires critical judgments and estimates by management including assumptions about the anticipated term and the yield that a market participant would require to purchase such a security in the current market environment 
as of december  we have recorded a temporary impairment charge of million  net of tax  within the caption accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the fair value of our auction rate security by incorporating assumptions about the anticipated term and the yield that a market participant would require to purchase such a security in the current market environment 
we determined that there was no incremental credit loss in and in  we recorded a credit loss of million in our consolidated statement of operations 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies or market conditions for this security can have a material impact on the values of the related assets  our financial position  and overall liquidity 
on november   atmi s belgian subsidiary acquired the remaining percent of the outstanding shares of artelis sa as part of the acquisition  we recognized a liability for the fair value of contingent payments tied to future revenue performance for the fiscal years through the contingent payment tied to future revenue performance has a range of possible outcomes from zero to million 
the fair value measurements were calculated using unobservable inputs primarily using discounted cash flow analyses  a discounted average rate of percent  and reliance on the market and product knowledge of internal experts  classified as level  requiring significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices or observable inputs for assets of a similar nature

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
in  we adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which simplified how entities are required to test goodwill for impairment by permitting an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
for reporting units where the qualitative determination does not indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value  the two step test is performed 
in order to perform the two step test we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplates other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  changes in the microelectronics and biopharmaceutical industries  changes in technology  and the execution of management s plans 
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired during a decline in projected reporting unit cash flows would not impact the conclusion we reached in although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
other long lived amortizable assets we evaluate the potential impairment of other long lived assets when appropriate 
if the carrying value of assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value

growth occurred in both our microelectronics and life sciences product lines  but was more pronounced in the microelectronics product lines  primarily as a result of improved wafer starts and fab utilization rates due in large part to the macroeconomic recovery  and also driven by strength in demand for our copper related materials  especially in memory applications 
revenues in were also negatively impacted by excess inventory in the sds distribution channel 
revenues in our microelectronics product lines grew percent to million in from million in in our life sciences product line  revenues grew percent to million in compared to million in the growth in life sciences revenues was driven by a combination of the continuing industry shift to disposables  which is driving demand for our single use mixing and containment technologies

the effect of foreign currency was not significant in as declines associated with the us dollar s weakness against the japanese yen were partially offset by strengthening against the euro 
gross profit 
gross profit increased percent to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was driven primarily by increased revenues across our product lines as a result of improved economic conditions and a mix benefit driven by increased sales volumes in our copper materials  sds  and life sciences product lines  partially offset by continued pricing pressure

liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
of particular importance to management are cash flows generated by operating activities  cash used for capital expenditures  and cash used for acquisitions 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  money market securities  government and government sponsored bond obligations  and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
we have contracted with investment advisers to invest our funds consistent with our investment policy 
the value of our investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in other than temporary declines in value of the investments  which could impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost 
we attempt to mitigate these risks with the assistance of our investment advisors by investing in high quality securities and monitoring the overall risk profile of our portfolio 
we also maintain a well diversified portfolio that limits our credit exposure through concentration limits set within our investment policy 
we have financed our operating needs and capital expenditures through cash flows from our operations  and existing cash 
we expect to continue to finance current and planned operating requirements principally through cash from operations  as well as existing cash resources 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of equity and debt financings or from other sources 
we continue to invest in r d to provide future sources of revenue through the development of new products  as well as through additional uses for existing products 
we consider r d and the development of new products and technologies an integral part of our growth strategy and a core competency of the company 
likewise  we continue to make capital expenditures in order to expand and modernize manufacturing and r d facilities around the globe and to drive efficiencies throughout the organization 
additionally  management considers  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of strategic technologies and businesses complementary to the company s current business

cash used for operations was also the result of increases in inventories and other assets  and decreases in accrued expenses 
partially offsetting these items were a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in other liabilities 
inventories increased by million in driven by stronger demand  million of sds purchases from matheson in the fourth quarter  and an increase to other strategic safety stocks 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities decreased by million in to million 
the primary reason for the decrease in was that we did not reinvest funds in marketable securities as existing marketable securities matured through the second half of the year in order to ensure liquid funds were on hand for the anticipated million contract termination payment to matheson 
other than changes in marketable securities  our investing activities primarily relate to purchases of property  plant and equipment and acquisitions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included bank deposits  time deposits  money market securities  and government and government sponsored bond obligations 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates on securities with maturities greater than one year would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
approximately percent of the company s revenues for the year ended december  were denominated in japanese yen jpy  korean won krw  and euros eur  but a majority of the product is sourced in us dollars 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material effect on the company s financial results in the future 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific exposures relating to intercompany payments and anticipated  but not yet committed  intercompany sales primarily parent company export sales to subsidiaries at pre established us dollar prices 
the terms of the forward foreign exchange contracts are generally matched to the underlying transaction being hedged  and are typically under one year 
because such contracts are directly associated with identified transactions  they are an effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency underlying the transaction 
we recognize in earnings other income expense  net changes in the fair value of all derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
we generally do not hedge overseas sales denominated in foreign currencies or translation exposures 
further  we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of our derivatives were highly effective throughout the periods reported 
at december   we held forward foreign currency exchange contracts as economic hedges with notional amounts totaling million  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated liabilities and which will be settled in either jpy  krw  eur  or new taiwan dollars ntd 
holding other variables constant  if there were a percent decline in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar for the jpy  krw  eur and ntd  the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  would increase by approximately million  which would be expected to be fully offset by foreign exchange gains on the amounts being hedged 
the effect of an immediate percent change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material effect on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
changes in market risk although we have seen mixed signs of stability  the global economy continues to deal with the repercussions of the global recession  as manifest in the recent european economic crisis that caused significant credit and financial market swings 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and deterioration of confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities
