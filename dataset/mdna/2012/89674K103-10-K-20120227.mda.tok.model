item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to stockholders that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules and components for communications applications 
we design  develop and manufacture advanced high performance rf solutions with gaas  gan  saw and baw technologies for customers worldwide 
we serve growing markets and a diverse customer base of manufacturers building connected mobile devices  g g g cellular base stations  triple play cable solutions  fiber optic networks  wlan  lte and defense and aerospace applications 
strategy and industry considerations we provide our customers with high performance  low cost rf solutions in the mobile devices  networks  and defense and aerospace end markets 
our mission is to deliver rf solutions that improve performance and lower the overall cost of our customer s applications and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within these markets 
in the mobile devices market  we provide high performance devices such as integrated modules  duplexers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and rf filters 
in the networks end market  we are a supplier of an extensive portfolio of gaas mmics and transistors and saw and baw filter components 
we provide the defense and aerospace end market with phased array radar and communications components 
we have been a leader in gan development since we experienced overall revenue growth for compared to following overall revenue growth in compared to the mobile devices end market represents the largest of our three major markets into which our products are sold 
our revenue from the mobile devices end market for increased compared to growth in this end market was driven primarily by the strong demand for smartphones 
as a result of the demand for smartphones and the expansion of rf content required for g g technology  our revenue from g g mobile devices increased in compared to this growth was offset by a decline of in revenue from sales of our g products  primarily the result of declines in our legacy cdma and gsm products 
overall demand for wireless connectivity products from the customer perspective has moved beyond traditional mobile devices to a variety of other applications  including data cards  tablets and various personal media devices 
as a result of this evolution  we have reclassified revenue from the sales of certain products between end markets 
our revenue from the networks end market decreased for compared to the decrease was due to softness in the base station market as service providers spent cautiously on network expansion and upgrades due to macro economic concerns 
we continue to believe in the long term growth prospects of our networks end market  since we believe telecommunications companies will be required to make investments in infrastructure to support growing data traffic reflecting consumer demand for increased data  particularly video as macro economic conditions improve 
an example of this is the strong growth in the optical transport communications submarket 
our revenue from the defense and aerospace end market decreased in compared to  primarily due to the timing of programs 
currently  we are seeing less demand from some major contracts that are completing  such as the b bomber and the f  but we are benefiting from increasing interest in gan and our packaged products 
in the longer term  we are shifting our strategy to emulate our successful module efforts in the commercial market 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of high demand  factories run at higher utilization rates  resulting in improved financial performance 
the overall rf market continues to grow  with continuing desire for content expansion in smartphones  which has driven increased demand for our products 
as a result  we have increased capital expenditures in order to add capacity to our factories to meet potential future demand 
as capacity increases  demand must keep pace or higher fixed manufacturing costs may adversely impact operating results as factories are not fully utilized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported 
table of contents amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  which affects gross margin  accounting for income taxes  which affects our tax provision  precious metals reclaim  which affects cost of goods sold  and stock based compensation  which affects cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for reserves for sales returns and allowances  and our reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the current year presentation 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of products in the mobile devices  networks  and defense and aerospace end markets 
we also receive revenue from foundry services  non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenue for any period 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title passes to the buyer 
our product sales include warranty provisions that provide that the products will be free of faulty workmanship or defective materials and that the products will conform to our published specifications or other specifications mutually agreed upon with the customer 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
our historical warranty claims experience  and our warranty liability  have not been material 
revenue from our distributors is recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
sales to our distributors were between and of our total revenue for  and our distributor agreements provide selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although in certain circumstances we offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve when offered 
further  the distributor s payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear the risks of ownership  the sales to distributors have economic substance and we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and we reserve for such instances 
we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
the revenue reserves have remained consistent as a percentage of revenue and we have visibility into the distributors inventory levels and qualifying sales  and are  therefore  able to reasonably estimate the revenue reserves 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenue when customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  which is the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenue from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees is recorded when the service is completed 
revenue from cost plus contracts is recognized as costs are incurred 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use standard cost methodology to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze last usage date as well as forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand  and reserve for the excess and identify and record other specific reserves 
precious metals reclaim we use historical experience to estimate the amount of reclaim on precious metals used in manufacturing at the end of each period applying a lower of average cost or market to determine the reclaim value 
the estimated value to be received from 
table of contents precious metal reclaim is included in other current assets 
income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we use the with and without approach  disregarding indirect tax impacts  for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share based deductions are recognized 
the utilization of bonus depreciation reduces federal and state taxes payable such that we do not have significant income taxes payable at december  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized in future tax returns 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our net deferred tax assets 
due to strong results in and increased confidence that we will continue to generate taxable income into the foreseeable future  our assessment regarding the potential to realize our deferred tax assets changed 
this assessment required us to exercise significant judgment and make estimates about our ability to generate revenue  gross profit  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
the result was the release of a majority of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of us deferred tax assets  as we do not believe it is more likely than not that these will be realized in future periods 
specifically  sources of capital gain taxable income were not identified to utilize capital loss carryforwards and the statute of limitations may expire before certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are utilized 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in all of our operational jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon tax audit  administrative appeals or final tax court determination 
the liabilities are reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate 
such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
as of december   we were not under audit by any income tax authorities 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
we believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
our income tax expense benefit as of and for each of the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  income tax expense benefit the tax provision primarily resulted from us federal  state and foreign income tax expense offset by benefits from the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the recognition of additional tax credits related to research and experimental r e spending 
the tax benefit resulted primarily from the release of the valuation allowance and the release of certain previously recorded tax liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the valuation allowance had previously been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
offsetting this benefit was the us federal tax expense for alternative minimum tax recorded under the with and without approach for excess share based compensation deductions 
the income tax provision primarily consisted of domestic and foreign tax liabilities in the us and costa rica 
no provision has been made for the us  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are intended to be  permanently reinvested outside the us except existing earnings that have been previously taxed 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax 
table of contents liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested outside the us in the event the foreign subsidiaries repatriate these earnings  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
our net unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities of any underpayment of income taxes  such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statement of income 
realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for  and  included in our consolidated statements of income in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model which requires a number of assumptions  including the expected lives of stock options  the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 
the value of the stock based payment award is recognized as stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the award s vesting schedule 
we determine our risk free rate assumption based upon the us treasury yield for obligations with contractual lives similar to the expected lives of our option grants and espp subscription periods 
the expected life represents the weighted average period the options are expected to remain outstanding  based upon historical experience 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and anticipated dividend distributions 
the expected volatility is based upon a blend of our historical volatility of our stock price and our exchange traded options for the expected life of the award 
forfeitures are estimated based upon historical and anticipated future experience for the expected life of the award 
acquisitions triaccess technologies  inc  on september   we completed the acquisition of triaccess technologies  inc ta  a provider of cable tv and fiber to the home fith and rf specific integrated circuits for the amplification of multimedia content  by purchasing of ta s outstanding shares 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing  net of cash acquired estimated earnout payment liability total the earnout payment liability was estimated at its fair value and represented an obligation to pay up to million to the former ta shareholders  over three years  upon ta product sales meeting certain revenue thresholds 
no earnout was paid in or because the sales of ta products did not meet the revenue threshold 
since acquisition  the initial obligation has been reduced to a remaining amount of up to million 
we estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  using a cash flow 
table of contents based approach discounted with a market discount rate 
in process research and development is considered an indefinite lived asset and will be amortized or impaired upon completion or abandonment of specific projects  estimated to be complete in the next three to five years 
all other intangible assets are being amortized over a period of three to five years 
goodwill is calculated as the purchase price in excess of the fair values of ta s assets and liabilities and represents our opportunity to expand our product line into video delivery  a high margin high growth market we currently under serve 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
the purchase price was allocated to ta s assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows in millions tangible assets acquired  net of cash acquired developed technology in process research and development goodwill total the results of operations for the ta business are included in our consolidated statements of income for the period from september  to december  pro forma results of operations have not been presented for this acquisition because its effect was not material to us 
wj communications  inc wj as part of our acquisition of wj in  we committed to a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities in san jose  california and china and to reduce certain redundant positions in the wj operations as a result of the acquisition 
all payments related to this restructuring were completed during the following table summarizes the charges taken and payments made as part of the restructuring plan in millions personnel lease abandonment costs total balance at december  payments accretion balance at december  payments balance at december  
table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis of operations addresses continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the table below sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 
these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

revenue from our g g products increased approximately in  compared to revenue from our connectivity products increased approximately in  compared to the increases in g g and connectivity product revenue were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales of our g products of approximately in compared to sales of these products collectively accounted for the following percentages of total mobile devices revenue 
table of contents year ended december  g g g connectivity total networks revenue from sales of our products in the networks end market decreased for  compared to the decrease was due to revenue from sales of our radio access and multi market products decreasing by and  respectively 
radio access revenue declined as a result of telecommunications companies slowing their investment in the expansion of base station capacity and no new major rollouts of base station infrastructure in emerging markets 
these decreases in sales of radio access and multi market products were partially offset by an increase in revenue from sales of our transport products due to success with our optical product line supporting customer network upgrades to gb s and gb s systems 
sales of products from these submarkets collectively accounted for the following percentages of total networks revenue year ended december  radio access transport multi market total defense and aerospace revenue from sales of our products in the defense and aerospace end market decreased in  compared to the decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of our radar products due to program completions 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in contract based revenue and sales of communications products 
significant customers foxconn technology group accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we experienced higher demand than could be supported by the capacity in our factories 
with the capacity constraints  we focused on meeting the demand of certain customers  including foxconn technology group 
in  as a result of allocating sales of available products to these customers and the customers success  revenue resulting from sales to foxconn technology group constituted a larger portion of our total revenue 
while we strive to maintain a strong relationship with our customers  our customers product life cycles are short and they continually develop new products 
the selection process for our products to be included in our customers new products is highly competitive 
there are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by foxconn technology group or our other customers 
any significant loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by this  or other significant customers could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
domestic and international revenue revenue from sales to our domestic customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in revenue from sales to our international customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from sales to our international customers was in  compared to in as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from sales to our international customers grew as a result of the increasing demand for our products in the mobile devices end market and the growth in revenue from foxconn technology group which is included as an international customer 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in  compared to from the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the mix of higher sales of our products in the mobile devices end market  which 
table of contents have lower gross profit compared to the products used in the other end markets and lower utilization in our factories as demand did not keep pace with capacity expansions during the year 
research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  from as a percentage of revenue  research development and engineering expense grew nearly percentage points in compared to the increase was primarily due to headcount growth  which led to a combination of higher labor costs and other spending on technical supplies  equipment and materials needed to support additional employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in remained relatively flat  increasing less than million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue also remained flat declining less than percentage point in compared to litigation expense litigation expense in increased million  or  from the increase was the result of costs incurred related to our litigation with avago

gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenue increased to in  compared to from the increase was primarily due to favorable product mix and better utilization 
research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  from these expenses increased primarily as a result of increases in labor costs and purchases of technical supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  from these expenses increased in primarily as a result of increased commissions and labor costs 
litigation expense litigation expense increased in to million  from million in the increase was primarily a result of our litigation with avago 
refer to part i  item for more details 
settlement of lawsuit on february   a purported derivative action was filed in the united states district court for the district of oregon  allegedly on behalf of triquint  against certain of triquint s officers and directors 
the case was settled on september  and we paid the plaintiffs million 
we recorded no lawsuit settlements in other income expense  net other income  net in increased million from the increase was primarily a result of the million 
table of contents recovered from a previously impaired investment as the result of the investment being purchased by another company 
the increase was offset by a million decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and by an increase of million in foreign exchange loss 
income tax benefit expense in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million in the benefit in was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance release which was recorded against the deferred tax assets and the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or from december  as a result of capital expenditures partially offset by cash provided by operations and cash received upon exercise of stock options 
other related changes as of december  compared to december  were our net accounts receivable balance decreased million  or primarily as a result of the timing of customer payments and lower volume of sales near the end of the year in  compared to the end of our net inventory balance increased million  or 
inventory turns calculated using ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the three months ended december  and december  dropped from to  as safety stock was replenished and revenue was lower during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of our net property  plant and equipment increased million  or 
the change was primarily due to capital expenditures of million during  which excludes the timing effect of capital expenditure payments in prepaid expenses and accounts payable of million 
this amount was partially offset by depreciation of million 
the capital expenditures made in were primarily for capacity expansion and equipment to support new products and technologies 
our deferred tax assets decreased million  or 
of the million in total deferred tax assets  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
this decrease was primarily related to the bonus depreciation taken during our current liabilities decreased million  or 
the decrease was the result of a reduction in variable compensation and the timing effect of capital expenditure payments 
line of credit on august   we extended our credit agreement the agreement with a syndicated group of lenders  including bank of america  na  as administrative agent and lender 
the agreement provided us with an unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility of million 
our obligations under the agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of september  upon the occurrence of certain events of default specified in the agreement  amounts due under the agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
as of and for the year ended december   there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement 
consequently  there was no interest cost for the agreement for the year ended december  sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  consisting of million in domestic balances and million in foreign balances together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and the balance available on our million syndicated credit facility  constitute our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe these sources of liquidity will satisfy our projected working capital  capital expenditure and possible investment needs through the next twelve months 
we intend to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings except existing earnings that have been previously taxed 
we are not presently aware of any restrictions on the repatriation of these funds 
if these funds were needed to fund our operations in the us  they could be repatriated 
repatriation of our foreign funds would require board approval and could result in additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes which could be partially offset by net operating losses and or foreign tax credits 
determining the amount of possible future taxes is not practicable 
at this time  we believe our domestic funds  along with the syndicated credit facility  are sufficient to meet our net domestic cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are lower than expected earnings or capital expenditures in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any shortfall through additional equity offerings  debt financing or 
table of contents credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
other significant cash obligations we currently expect capital expenditures of approximately million in the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  that will affect our future liquidity in millions payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation triaccess earnout sabbatical other obligations total the amounts presented represent leases of certain equipment  office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides eligible employees and members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the amounts deferred by the participants and held by us in the other noncurrent assets  net line item of our consolidated balance sheets and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheets 
the balance represents the fair value of the estimated earnout payment liability payable to former ta shareholders based upon ta product sales 
the balance represents the estimated commitments for sabbatical payments for all eligible full time employees 
the balance represents the estimated pension liability payable to the employees of our german subsidiary 
the pension liability becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of the gaas business of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
we have included the reinsurance receivables of million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item on our consolidated balance sheets and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net tax liabilities  which are included as long term income tax liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu with regard to the presentation of comprehensive income 
the update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
the main provisions of the update provide that an entity that reports items of other comprehensive income has the option to present comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
a single statement must present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
in a two statement approach  an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement 
that statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income  a total for other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
the option in current gaap that permits the presentation of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated 
the amendments in this update will be 
table of contents applied retrospectively 
the update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  although we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  we do not believe that its adoption will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  once adopted  the standard will change the presentation of the financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu with regard to testing for goodwill impairment 
the update is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described under current guidance 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
the asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  although we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  we do not believe that its adoption will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and consist of highly rated  short term investments  such as money market funds  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
further  we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially affected by an immediate change in interest rates 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments as of december  in millions cost fair value cash and cash equivalents available for sale investments foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica  the philippines and germany
