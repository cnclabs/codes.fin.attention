table of contents revenues revenues for the year ended june  decreased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended july  the decrease was largely due to reduced product sales attributable to the disruption in our business caused by the flooding of our contract manufacturer in thailand which resulted in the suspension of the manufacturing of a significant number of our products  and due to a decrease in demand in our telecommunications related markets  largely associated with uncertain global macroeconomic conditions 
for the year ended june   huawei accounted for million  or percent  and fujitsu accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues

costs and expenses related to our manufacturing resources incurred in connection with the development of new products are included in research and development expense 
our cost of revenues for the year ended june  decreased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended july  the decrease was primarily related to reduced costs associated with lower volumes of revenue attributable to a decrease in product sales

gross profit gross profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin rate decreased to percent for the year ended june   compared to percent for the year ended july  the decrease in gross margin rate was primarily due to the impact of our fixed costs on lower revenues  and correspondingly lower production volumes  which is a result of the disruption in our business from the flooding in thailand  coupled with a lower mix of relatively higher margin gb s transmission products and a higher mix of less mature  currently lower margin gb s transmission products that are not yet margin optimized

in addition to the million insurance coverage advance payments we received in our fiscal year associated with the flooding in thailand  we also expect to receive substantial additional insurance proceeds  although neither the amounts nor the timing of such payments can be reasonably estimated at this time 
in the third quarter of our fiscal year  we determined the fair value of the month earnout obligation to be fixed at million based on sales of mintera products during the eighteen month period ended january  we settled million of the million earnout obligation in cash during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we settled the remaining million balance in cash during the first quarter of fiscal at june   we recorded the million in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet related to the earnout obligation owed to mintera 
from time to time  we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses  such as our acquisition of opnext  our merger with avanex  our acquisitions of xtellus and mintera  our exchange of assets agreement with newport and our sale of a legacy product line 
we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates 
any such transactions could result in us issuing significant number of new equity or debt securities including promissory notes  the incurrence or assumption of debt  and the utilization of our cash and cash equivalents 
we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition  through either the issuance of equity securities and or borrowings 
if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
risk management foreign currency risk as our business is multinational in scope  we are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and the swiss franc 
in addition  with the acquisition of opnext  we will have an increasing portion of our expenses denominated in japanese yen 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the us pound sterling  the swiss franc  the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling  and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we held three foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to september as of june   we recorded minimal unrealized gains to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations at june   by nature of the obligation and amount due over identified periods of time  are set out in the table below operating lease payments sublease income purchase obligations thousands fiscal year thereafter the purchase obligations consist of our total outstanding purchase order commitments at june  any capital purchases to which we are committed are included in these outstanding purchase order commitments 
operating leases are future annual commitments under non cancelable operating leases  including rents payable for land and buildings 
off balance sheet arrangements we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however  such insurance may not cover any  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
we also have indemnification clauses in various contracts that we enter into in connection with acquisitions and during the normal course of business  such as indemnifications in favor of customers in respect of liabilities they may incur as a result of purchasing our products should such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have not historically paid out any material amounts related to these indemnifications  therefore  no accrual has been made for these indemnifications 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from those based on our estimates and judgments or could have been materially different if we had used different assumptions  estimates or conditions 
in addition  our financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 

table of contents we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of such estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that the policies described below involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns revenue represents the amounts  excluding sales taxes  derived from the sale of goods and services to third party customers during a given period 
specifically  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title has transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
for certain sales  we are required to determine  in particular  whether the delivery has occurred  whether items will be returned and whether we will be paid under normal commercial terms 
for certain products sold to customers  we specify delivery terms in the agreement under which the sale was made and assess each shipment against those terms  and only recognize revenue when we are certain that the delivery terms have been met 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates for sales returns are based on historical sales return rates  other known factors and our return policy 
before accepting a new customer  we review publicly available information and credit rating databases to provide ourselves with reasonable assurance that the new customer will pay all outstanding amounts in accordance with our standard terms 
for existing customers  we monitor historic payment patterns and we perform ongoing credit evaluations to assess whether we can expect payment in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement under which the sale was made 
we recognize revenues from financially distressed customers when collectability becomes reasonably assured  assuming all other above criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in fiscal year we issued billings of million for products that were shipped to nortel  but for which payment was not received prior to nortel s bankruptcy filing on january  as a result  the corresponding revenue was deferred  and therefore was not recognized as revenues or accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at the time of such billings  as we determined that such amounts were not reasonably assured of collectability in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
as of june   we had remaining contractual receivables from nortel totaling million which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that collectability becomes reasonably assured for these deferred billings in future periods  our future results of operations will benefit from the recognition of these amounts 
inventory valuation in general  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost to acquire or manufacture our products or market value  less write offs of inventory we believe could prove to be unsalable 
manufacturing costs include the cost of the components purchased to produce our products and related labor and overhead 
we review our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if it is saleable 
products may be unsalable because they are technically obsolete due to substitute products  specification changes or excess inventory relative to customer forecasts 
we currently reduce the cost basis for inventory using methods that take these factors into account 
if we find that the cost of inventory is greater than the current market price  we will write the inventory down to the estimated selling price  less the estimated cost to complete and sell the product 

table of contents business combinations our acquisitions consummated after june   including the acquisition of the high power laser diodes business from newport on july  and our acquisitions of xtellus on december  and mintera on july   were accounted for pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
under asc topic  there are significant differences as compared to previous guidance in determining the purchase price of an acquired entity  including under asc topic  the purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred on the date of the business combination 
previously  the value of equity based consideration transferred was determined based on the fair value at the time of announcement of the business combination 
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are recorded at the acquisition date fair value 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is recognized for any excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a bargain purchase gain results if the fair value of the purchase price is less than the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we recorded a million bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of newport s high power laser diodes business during fiscal year for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  we estimate useful lives by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and specific factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  patents  supply agreements  capitalized licenses and customer contracts 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from to years and  in the case of one specific customer contract  years 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant 
for instance  the estimated fair value of our common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of xtellus was determined using the closing price of per share as of the acquisition date  december   adjusted by a discount rate to reflect the lack of marketability due to the shares being unregistered and subject to restrictions on transfer under rule of the securities act 
in addition  the estimated fair value of the value protection guarantee issued in connection with the xtellus acquisition was determined by using management estimates of future operating results and a monte carlo simulation model to determine the likelihood of achieving certain market conditions 
for our mintera acquisition  we agreed to pay additional revenue based consideration whereby former security holders of mintera were entitled to receive up to million  determined based on a set of sliding scale formulas  to the extent revenue from mintera products is more than million in the months following the acquisition and or more than million in the months following the acquisition 
the estimated fair value of these obligations were determined using management estimates of the total amounts expected to be paid based on estimated operating results  discounted to their present value using our incremental borrowing cost 
our preliminary estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period for a business combination  which may be up to one year  we may record adjustments to the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
after the conclusion of the measurement period or our final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  subsequent adjustments affecting earnings are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of adopting the revised accounting standards provided for by asc topic as of the beginning of our fiscal year  certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions consummated after june   including the direct transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred previously  direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price  the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination previously  restructuring and exit costs directly resulting from the business combination were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation  and the fair value of in process research and development is recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed  at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life  or abandoned  at which time the intangible asset is expensed previously  in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 

table of contents insurance recoveries insurance recoveries related to impairment losses previously recorded and other recoverable expenses will be recognized up to the amount of the related loss or expense in the period that recoveries become realizable 
insurance recoveries under business interruption coverage and insurance recovery gains in excess of amounts previously written off related to impaired inventory and equipment or in excess of other recoverable expenses previously recognized will be recognized when they become realizable and all contingencies have been resolved 
during the year ended june   we received million in advance payments from one of our insurers relating to losses we incurred due to the flooding in thailand 
this payment is a general advance from our insurer against all thailand flood related claims and was not specifically identified as reimbursement for any particular loss or claim 
as there were no contingencies associated with this payment  we recorded this advance payment within flood related income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june  the evaluation of insurance recoveries requires estimates and judgments about future results which affect reported amounts and certain disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
insurance recoveries we receive in future periods will be recorded net of flood related expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of june   we have not recorded any estimated amounts relating to potential future insurance recoveries in the consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested annually for impairment  in our case during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if an event or circumstance suggests impairment has occurred 
in addition  we review identifiable intangibles  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes to the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly below carrying value before the end of its estimated useful life 
the first step of testing goodwill for impairment is based on a reporting unit s fair value  which is generally determined through market prices 
in certain cases  due to the absence of market prices for a particular element of our business  we have elected to base our testing on discounted future expected cash flows 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the forecasted cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we perform and present to our board of directors 
in this process  each reporting unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three to seven years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates used for determining discounted future cash flows are generally based on our weighted average cost of capital and are then adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three to seven year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used in our models are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industry in which we operate 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable  various economic factors could cause the results of our goodwill testing to vary significantly 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual first step analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the current level of our market capitalization 
based on this analysis  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended july   we observed indicators of potential impairment of our goodwill  including the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the decline of our market capitalization 
specifically  indicators emerged within our wss reporting unit  which was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition of xtellus 
these indicators led us to conclude that an impairment test was required to be performed for goodwill related to this reporting unit 
we determined in our first step goodwill impairment analysis that the goodwill was in fact impaired 
we completed our full evaluation of the second step impairment analysis  which indicated that the goodwill was fully impaired 
we recorded million for impairment losses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended july  in conjunction with our second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of the intangible assets of this reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired 
this impairment did not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize in our statement of operations all stock based compensation  including grants of employee stock options  grants of restricted stock and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  based on their fair values on the grant dates 
estimating the grant date fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights requires us to make judgments in the determination of inputs into the black scholes merton valuation model which we use to arrive at an estimate of the fair value for such awards 
these inputs are based upon highly subjective assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates and the expected life of the options 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited during any given period 
as required under the accounting standards  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock options granted and purchase rights in future periods may change 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the years ended june   july  and july   we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively  in our results from continuing operations 
see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability based approach 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred income tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
in fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize deferred tax assets of million in china and million in switzerland 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax attributes in other jurisdictions  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our remaining foreign and domestic deferred tax assets as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we finance our operations through a mixture of issuances of equity securities  finance leases  working capital and by drawing on our credit agreement 
our only exposure to interest rate fluctuations is on our cash deposits and for amounts borrowed under our credit agreement 
at june  there was million outstanding under our credit agreement at an average interest rate of percent per annum and million in outstanding standby letters of credit secured under our credit agreement 
an increase in our average interest rate on our credit agreement by percent would increase our annual interest expense by million 
we monitor our interest rate risk on cash balances primarily through cash flow forecasting 
cash that is surplus to immediate requirements is invested in short term deposits with banks accessible with one day s notice and invested in overnight money market accounts 
we believe our current interest rate risk is immaterial 

table of contents foreign currency as our business has grown and is multinational in scope  we are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
despite our change in domicile from the united kingdom to the united states in  and our movement of certain functions  including assembly and test operations  from the united kingdom to china  in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and the swiss franc 
in addition  with the acquisition of opnext  we will have an increasing portion of our expenses denominated in japanese yen 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the us pound sterling  the swiss franc and the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses  could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
as of june   our uk subsidiary had million  net  in us dollar denominated operating intercompany payables and million in us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  net  related to sales to external customers 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the us pound sterling would lead to a profit of million us dollar strengthening  or loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these receivables and other cash balances  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our consolidated statement of operations 
hedging program we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the chinese yuan  korean won  israeli shekel  swiss franc or the euro  but we may in the future if conditions warrant 
we also do not currently hedge our exposure related to our us dollar denominated intercompany payables and receivables 
we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we held three foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to september and we have recorded an immaterial unrealized gain to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the dollar between june  and the maturity dates of the put and call instruments underlying these contracts would lead to a profit of million us dollar weakening or break even us dollar strengthening on our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  should they be held to maturity
