item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of october   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings  finance charges on installment sale contracts for cemetery property and trust management fees 
we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale 
general for fiscal year  we generated million in revenue and million in gross profit  our highest revenue and gross profit in four years 
we increased cemetery gross profit by percent and funeral gross profit by percent while expanding cemetery gross profit margin by basis points and funeral gross profit margin by basis points 
we produced the highest annual cemetery property and preneed funeral production in five years 
earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year fiscal year results included an after tax benefit of million from our successful settlement of our hurricane katrina litigation 
earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were 
for fiscal years and our fiscal year results reflect an increase in cemetery revenue and a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative  including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures 
we generated million in operating cash flow during fiscal year and maintained our strong balance sheet with million of cash and marketable securities on hand and no amounts borrowed on our million senior secured revolving credit facility at fiscal year end 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our outstanding class a common stock for million 
these purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program have resulted in a percent decrease in total shares outstanding in the last twelve months 
also  during fiscal year we announced a percent increase in our annual dividend to 
per share and returned million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends  or 
per share 
in fiscal year  we began a program of developing cremation gardens and other cremation projects in our cemeteries 
we have successfully completed cremation projects  and we currently have projects under construction and approximately additional projects currently under feasibility review 
we spent million in fiscal year on these projects  compared to million in fiscal year and plan to spend approximately to million in fiscal year cemetery cremation sales improved percent in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  highlighting the positive returns on our ongoing cremation initiative 
additional information about our business and strategies can be found in item business 
in the second quarter  we announced an organizational restructuring and workforce reduction 
the organizational changes involve a restructure of the sales organization and realignment of our geographic regions and regional management to better integrate operations and sales 
the restructure of our sales organization focuses on providing more efficient and effective sales strategy  management  mentoring  training and recruiting with the ultimate goals of improving customer service and increasing sales 
the new organization reduces the layers of sales management and is designed to provide increased opportunities for sales employees 
during the beginning of fiscal year  we will finalize our sales force restructuring by implementing changes that primarily impact our customer facing sales force  including changing our compensation structure 
separate from the changes related to the sales organization  we also announced in the second quarter a reduction of our workforce by approximately employees  primarily within our corporate support services 
the combined effect of our organizational restructuring and workforce reduction is expected to produce annual savings of approximately million 

table of contents our trust earnings continue to be impacted by the volatility in the financial markets 
the adverse financial market conditions throughout the latter part of fiscal year and the early part of fiscal year caused a decrease in our revenue from trust activities 
from fiscal years through  we recognized million  million  million  million and million  respectively  in revenue from trust related activities 
during fiscal years through  our trust portfolios had total returns of percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  in our preneed trusts and percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  in our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
financial summary for fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported net earnings of million  earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  total revenue of million and total gross profit of million 
our net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax charge due to the organizational restructuring and a separate reduction in workforce occurring primarily in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  during fiscal year we sold one of our e commerce businesses resulting in a net loss from discontinued operations of million 
for fiscal year  we reported net earnings of million  earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  total revenue of million and total gross profit of million 
our net earnings for fiscal year included a million million after tax insurance settlement related to the successful resolution of our litigation related to hurricane katrina damages and a million million after tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt as a result of the refinancing of our senior notes and revolving credit facility in april cemetery revenue improved million  or percent  to million for the year ended october  cemetery property sales improved million  or percent  compared to fiscal year in addition  revenue related to trust activities increased by million and merchandise delivered and services performed increased by million 
these improvements were partially offset by a million decline in finance charges as a result of reduced interest rates in this low interest rate environment and a million decrease in revenue recognized for cemetery property sales for which the property was not yet constructed or the down payment required for revenue recognition was not yet received 
we generated million in funeral revenue during fiscal year  a million decline from fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a percent decline in same store funeral services performed  which we believe is consistent with industry wide data in our markets 
the decline in funeral services was partially offset by a percent improvement in same store average revenue per funeral service 
our net preneed funeral sales increased percent during fiscal year compared to fiscal year preneed funeral sales are deferred until a future period and have no impact on current revenue 
cemetery gross profit increased million  or percent  to million for the year ended october  the increase in gross profit is primarily due to the improvement in revenue  as previously noted  as well as a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative  including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures earlier this year 
cemetery gross profit margin improved basis points to percent for fiscal year from percent for fiscal year funeral gross profit increased million  or percent  to million for fiscal year the improvement in gross profit is primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses associated with our continuous improvement initiative  including successfully integrating our operations and sales organizational structures earlier this year  as well as an improvement in our insurance claims experience 
funeral gross profit margin improved basis points to percent for fiscal year from percent for fiscal year during fiscal year  we announced a percent increase in our annual dividend to 
per share from 
per share 
we paid million in dividends to our shareholders in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year throughout fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our outstanding class a common stock for million 
as of october  we had million remaining under our million stock repurchase program 
our weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to million shares for fiscal year compared to million shares for fiscal year this decrease is primarily a result of our stock repurchase program  which yielded a positive impact on our earnings per share 
purchases of class a common stock under our share repurchase program have resulted in a percent decrease in total shares outstanding in the last twelve months 

table of contents cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decline in cash flow is primarily due to million of the hurricane katrina settlement received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the third quarter of  our board of directors appointed dr 
john b 
elstrott  jr 
to the newly created position of lead independent director 
among his primary responsibilities as lead independent director  dr 
elstrott will act as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the ceo  assist the ceo and the chairman of the board with developing board agendas and preside at board meetings and executive sessions of the independent directors 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with the retail land sale provisions of asc property  plant and equipment 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  and the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog represented approximately billion and billion  respectively  of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are ultimately delivered 
this is made up of approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance as of october  and approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance as of october  this represents the face value of the backlog taking into account unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses including impairments on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the current face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our historical experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
in addition  in fiscal years and  the analysis assumes a weighted average annual return of approximately percent and percent  respectively  projected from our trusts over the expected life of the contracts and zero percent for increasing death benefits on insurance contracts 
actual results could differ materially from our assumptions used in the calculation 
proceeds of these insurance policies may be used by customers for other purposes and are portable to other funeral service providers or for completely separate purposes 
supplemental trust portfolio information we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services together with the preneed funeral merchandise and services trust  preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care 
the size of the trusts depends primarily upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of dividend and interest income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
as of october   approximately percent of our trust portfolio was invested in cash  percent in equities  percent in fixed income securities  percent in preferred stock  percent in each of real estate index funds  commodity index funds and master limited partnership index funds and percent in other investments 
our trust portfolios and trust earnings continue to be impacted by volatility in the financial markets and contain a substantial proportion of equity securities 
the equity securities have generally experienced increases and decreases in value commensurate with the overall financial markets 

table of contents during fiscal year  we realized aggregate net losses of million in our preneed trusts and recorded a million tax valuation allowance 
in addition  we realized aggregate net losses of million in our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
we recorded a related charge for the estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of million in certain of our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
at their lowest quarter end point  our trust portfolios reached a net unrealized loss position of million as of january  as of october   we recorded other than temporary impairments of million in our preneed trusts and million in our perpetual care trusts  and reduced the cost basis of the related securities to fair market value 
these losses and impairments had no impact on our balance sheet  as the securities and corresponding liabilities are already recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet 
however  the losses and impairments in our preneed trusts were allocated to the underlying contracts and will be recognized as the services and merchandise are performed and delivered in the future  reducing the revenues and gross profits we would otherwise have realized related to those contracts 
after these losses and impairments and an overall improvement in the market  our net unrealized loss position was million as of october  during late fiscal  we reviewed alternative asset allocation models and selected new asset allocation goals that emphasize diversification and reduce volatility 
we have taken advantage of the improvement in the overall markets to adjust our asset allocation towards these goals 
currently  percent of our portfolio is invested in asset classes that were not represented in our trusts just three years ago  including real estate investment trusts  high yield mutual funds and master limited partnerships  among others 
we have been investing in proportionately more exchange traded index funds and fewer individual equities 
we continuously evaluate our investment strategies to maintain an asset allocation that provides consistent returns with appropriate risk 
the long term objectives are to preserve principal while seeking appropriate levels of current income and capital appreciation in order to provide returns that match inflation plus a reasonable return 
the following table presents the annual realized return in our trusts for fiscal years through the returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses  but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
the following table presents the annual total returns in our trusts for fiscal years through including realized and unrealized gains and losses the following table presents the total returns of our preneed trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts including realized and unrealized gains and losses for the periods indicated preneed trusts cemetery perpetual care trusts for the year ended october  for three years ended october  for five years ended october  for ten years ended october  during fiscal years and  we experienced positive trends in the overall market and in our preneed and perpetual care trusts 
for the years ended october  and  our preneed trusts experienced a total return  including both realized and unrealized losses  of percent and percent  respectively  and our cemetery perpetual care trusts experienced a total return  including both realized and unrealized losses  of percent and percent  respectively 
in our preneed trusts  the fair market value of the investments in the trusts were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october  and october   respectively 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  the fair market value of our investments were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october  and october   respectively 
for additional information see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements in item the cost basis of our trust assets reflect the price we originally paid for the securities  reduced for other than temporary impairments we have recorded pursuant to gaap 

table of contents we believe that the trust investments will appreciate in value over the long term 
we continue to monitor our investment portfolio closely 
although we have significant unrealized and unallocated losses in our trust portfolio  as of october  and october   we had million and million  respectively  in trust earnings  net of losses  that have been realized and allocated to contracts that will be recognized in the future as the underlying contracts are performed 
securities with unrealized losses totaling million at october  were also in a loss position at october   down from million at the end of the last fiscal year 
for additional information see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements in item we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position and whether a charge to earnings to record a liability for any expected losses is required 
no charge has ever been required 
for additional information  see note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item and overview of critical accounting policies 
we generate revenue related to the trusts from investment management fees earned by our subsidiary  iti 
during fiscal years through  these fees amounted to million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
these fees are based on the fair market value of the investments in the preneed trust portfolio and the cemetery perpetual care trusts 
significant changes in the fair market value of the portfolio impact the fees earned by the company

the healthcares services sector risks include the failure of research and development products  class action litigation related to adverse side effects  changes in the level of us government funding for medicare and medicaid  the loss of patent protection on existing pharmaceutical drugs and the impact of the patient protection and affordable care act 
impact of preneed sales on near term cash the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the timing of the tax payments on the sale  whether the sale is funded by trust or insurance  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contracts such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  therefore  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed trust sales are generally cash flow negative initially  but may become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
generally preneed insurance sales are slightly cash flow positive as commissions received generally exceed the commissions paid to sales counselors 
commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred 
cash flows related to earnings in our trusts  deposits and withdrawals and related matters and our cemetery perpetual care funding obligations are described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements included in item overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are ultimately performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are ultimately performed 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
table of contents revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is ultimately performed or merchandise is actually delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of asc property  plant and equipment 
under this guidance  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to completion of its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by our preneed trusts including impairments until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 
unrealized capital gains and losses are not allocated to specific contracts 
from time to time  unidentified contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered 
using historical trends and statistical analysis  we have recorded an estimated net debit for these items 
perpetual care funding obligation certain states allow us to withdraw realized capital gains from cemetery perpetual care trusts  while other states prohibit these withdrawals 
these earnings and related funds are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs and are recorded as revenue 
in the event that we have been allowed to withdraw realized gains from the trust and then realize net losses in the trust  we may determine we have a funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of the trust 
a charge is recorded in the statement of earnings at the time it is considered probable that we will be required to restore the realized losses 
loss contract analysis each quarter we perform an analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and realized earnings  then subtract realized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts as of that particular balance sheet date 
we then consider unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of adjusted proceeds after considering net unrealized gains and losses to the estimated direct costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of funeral and cemetery merchandise costs and salaries  supplies and equipment related to the delivery of a preneed contract 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our deferred revenue 
due to the positive margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have experienced in prior years  there is currently sufficient capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would occur 
no such charges have ever been recorded 
variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
for a more detailed discussion of our related accounting policies  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not recorded on our balance sheet  as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item determination of whether securities held in trusts are other than temporarily impaired we have significant unrealized losses in certain securities held in our trust portfolios 
determining whether these losses are temporary or other than temporary is inherently subjective 
to determine whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary  we analyze the securities on an individual trust account basis as well as a security by security basis 
the evaluation first considers whether we have sufficient liquidity within each individual trust account to hold the investments in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time 
the liquidity assessment of the individual trust accounts includes estimates of annual trust income  historical deposits and 
table of contents withdrawals  cash balances  upcoming debt investment maturities and other liquidity alternatives 
we also evaluate consensus analyst recommendations  concerns specific to the issuer  overall market performance and annual returns required to recover the loss 
we also evaluate whether we have the intent to hold the security until it recovers in value 
if we determine that an unrealized loss is other than temporary  we must write down the cost basis of the impaired security to fair value at that time  which would generally be the current trading price 
any subsequent recovery in fair value cannot be recognized until the security is sold 
any losses realized from other than temporary impairments of securities held in our trusts generally would have no immediate impact on our balance sheet  because our trust portfolio securities are already carried at fair market value on our balance sheet 
in our preneed trusts  losses from other than temporary impaired securities generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow 
however  such losses would be allocated to the underlying contracts and would have an adverse impact on the amount of future revenue recognized from the trusts at the time the specific contract is ultimately performed 
accordingly  a determination that any significant losses in these trust portfolios are other than temporary could have a material adverse effect on our future trust earnings 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  such losses generally would have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the losses caused us to realize a probable funding obligation as described in item a risk factors and overview of critical accounting policies perpetual care funding obligation 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of our historical collection and write off experience 
in addition  we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity 
this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue 
we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance and third party commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily using the straight line method 
buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
equipment is generally depreciated over the following ranges light equipment  to years  heavy equipment  years  computer equipment and software  to years  and crematory equipment  to years 
vehicles are generally depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 

table of contents valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated 
gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not our operating regions are considered economically similar 
qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services  consistency of products and services and the delivery of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries  the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation  we have eleven reporting units 
because goodwill impairment tests are applied at the reporting unit level  a change in a reporting unit can have a material effect on the outcome of the test 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill was allocated to these reporting units based on the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we calculate the fair value  or enterprise value  for each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as supplemented by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda 
we also review multiples paid in recent acquisition transactions within the deathcare industry 
in fiscal year  we adopted guidance that simplified the testing for goodwill impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if performing the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary 
in april  we announced an organizational restructuring and a separate workforce reduction 
the organizational changes involved a restructure of the sales organization and realignment of our geographic regions and regional management 
due to the realignment of certain regions  we evaluated the economic similarity of our regions and determined that two of our funeral reporting units were impacted by this change 
our former southeastern region was split in two  with the northern part of the region forming the new southeastern region and the southern part of the region combining with the former puerto rico region to form the new south florida puerto rico region 
for these two funeral reporting units  which have a combined goodwill balance of million  we proceeded directly to step one of the impairment test and performed a quantitative analysis  which was performed due to the fact these are two new regions and a previous analysis was not available 
this reorganization required a reallocation of goodwill 
from a qualitative perspective  in evaluating whether it is more likely than not ie  a probability of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  relevant events and circumstances were taken into account  with greater weight assigned to events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amounts of its assets 
items that were considered include  but are not limited to  the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  costs of merchandise or labor  overall financial performance  other entity specific events  such as changes in management or key personnel  events affecting a reporting unit  such as a change in the composition of net assets or an expected disposition  and a change in our share price 
in addition  we also considered recent fair value calculations for each reporting unit and determined that there was a significant difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
after assessing these and other factors  we determined that is was more likely than not that the fair value of all of our reporting units was greater than the carrying amounts 

table of contents for the two reporting units for which we performed a quantitative analysis  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
we determined the fair value of the reporting units based on present value techniques including discounted cash flows 
the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows 
in projecting our cash flows  we used growth rates generally ranging from one to five percent in revenues and costs  and also considered additional cremation gardens and other mausoleum projects that are currently under construction 
for the discount rate  we used percent  which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry  suppliers and capital structure as adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
the terminal value is calculated as the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period divided by the discount rate minus terminal growth rates ranging from to percent 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis of the terminal values and used the midpoint enterprise value as our best estimate 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal  state and united states possessions  capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal  state and united states possessions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change in this allowance in a period  we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
approximately percent of the october  fair market value of our preneed trusts are in trusts for which the company is the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  may require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate sufficient capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will pay higher taxes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the guidance on uncertain tax positions in asc income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before to the extent tax  interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions in the future  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of tax expense  interest expense or other expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies but below our deductible 
with respect to health insurance  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incur due to damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters

during fiscal year  we realized cost savings from our continuous improvement initiatives 
in august  we successfully settled litigation related to hurricane katrina damages for million  including million that was advanced to the company in fiscal year interest expense decreased million to million during fiscal year primarily due to the significant repurchases of our senior convertible notes in the open market that occurred through fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the increased rate in fiscal year is primarily due to a million charge to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to a change in puerto rican tax legislation 
this charge to tax expense was offset primarily by a reduction in the valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry forward  due in part to the performance of our trust portfolio during fiscal year in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a million tax benefit caused by the reduced valuation allowance on the capital loss carry forward and a million tax benefit attributable to the utilization of state net operating loss carryovers realized from our state tax planning strategies 
during fiscal year  we completed refinancing transactions that significantly extended our debt maturity profile at favorable terms 
we issued million of percent senior notes due and repurchased million of our million outstanding percent senior notes due we redeemed the remaining million of our percent senior notes outstanding in may at par

liquidity and capital resources general we generate cash in our operations primarily from at need sales  preneed sales that turn at need  funds we are able to withdraw from our trusts and escrow accounts when preneed sales turn at need  monies collected on preneed sales that are not required to be placed in trust and items such as cemetery perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges 
over the last five years  we have generated more than million annually in cash flow from operations 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash flows from operations 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under the million senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as of october   we had no amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility  which matures in  and our availability under the facility  after giving consideration to million outstanding letters of credit and the million florida bond  was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about the florida bond

dividends amounted to million for the year ended october  compared to million during fiscal year the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the board of directors after its review of our financial performance 
in june and september  we increased our stock repurchase program by million resulting in a million program 
under the program  we purchased million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended october  in november  we purchased an additional million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million and as of november   had million remaining available under the program 
repurchases under the program are limited to our class a common stock  and are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
we believe that the use of our cash to make acquisitions of death care businesses  pay dividends  repurchase debt and stock  invest in our strategic initiatives and construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or on our own strategic locations are all attractive options 
we are continuing to invest in further improving our business processes  and continue to look at ways to improve our organization and cost structure 
in fiscal year  we began a program of developing cremation gardens and other cremation projects in our cemeteries 
we have successfully completed cremation projects  and we currently have projects either under construction or expected to begin construction and approximately additional projects under feasibility review 
for the year ended october   we spent million on these projects  compared to million in fiscal year  and we plan to spend approximately million to million in fiscal year as of october   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 

table of contents we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions remains a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require us to draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility or pursue additional debt or equity financing 
during the year ended october   we invested million of available cash for the acquisition of two funeral businesses  and during the year ended october   we invested million of available cash for the acquisition of two funeral home cemetery combinations 
we received internal revenue service approval in fiscal year on five requests for changes in tax accounting methods  which resulted in the deferral of approximately million of taxable income 
these changes increased the amounts available to offset taxable income beginning in to approximately million 
these changes primarily relate to our tax accounting methods for preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral merchandise 
these changes permit us to defer the recognition of income for tax purposes and payment of taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is provided or the merchandise is actually delivered 
we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
in fiscal year  we received approval from the internal revenue service for a change in tax accounting method resulting in the deferral of approximately million in revenue until the service is performed or merchandise is delivered  thereby increasing the amount available to reduce taxable income 
this increase resulted or will result in approximately million of reduced tax payments 
we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million when the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
as a result of the tax accounting changes that took place in fiscal years through described above  we had approximately million available to offset taxable income as of we were able to utilize approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year  which reduced federal income taxes paid by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we are continuing to review all of our tax accounting methods to determine opportunities to further improve our current tax position 
several possible changes are being considered that could result in potential reductions in future tax payments 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty what  if any  reductions in future tax payments we will obtain 
however  we currently do not expect that these potential reductions in future tax payments  if obtained  will be as substantial as those obtained in fiscal years through  which resulted in a combination of refunds and reductions of federal income tax payments totaling in excess of million 
based on the currently approved changes  we expect to have federal net operating losses available in fiscal year to offset a portion of federal income taxes 
for fiscal years and  we expect our federal cash tax payments to be approximately million to million above fiscal year amounts 
cash flow comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decline in cash flow is primarily due to million of the hurricane katrina settlement received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for fiscal year the change is primarily due to a million net change related to purchases and sales of certificates of deposits  marketable securities and restricted cash equivalents offset by declines in capital expenditures and acquisition spending

dividends paid increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to the receipt of million of the hurricane katrina settlement during the fourth quarter of in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  primarily driven by the timing of trust withdrawals and deposits  partially offset by an increase in inventory and receivables 
these increases are due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october  the change is primarily due to a million net change related to purchases and sales of certificates of deposits  marketable securities and restricted cash equivalents 
in fiscal year  we replaced a letter of credit by posting cash to satisfy collateral requirements with insurance carriers and invested the cash collateral in a money market fund 
both methods of posting collateral are available to us in the future at any time

for the year ended october   capital expenditures were million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for the construction of new funeral homes and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
the increase in maintenance capital expenditures is primarily due to several large building improvement projects undertaken in fiscal year as well as increased vehicle and equipment purchases as we assess lease versus purchase decisions for our fleet 
our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october  during fiscal year  we repurchased million of our common stock compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we had million in repayments of long term debt primarily due to purchases of our senior convertible notes

the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments related to the specified contingent obligations specified below in millions as of october  expiration by period contingent obligations total less than year years years more than years cemetery perpetual care trust funding obligations long term obligations related to uncertain tax positions in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past from our cemetery perpetual care trusts  regulators may seek replenishment of subsequent realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they restore the initial corpus 
the estimated probable funding obligation in the cemetery perpetual care trusts in these states was million as of october  as of october   we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states that could be subject to a future funding obligation 
because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  we believe it is reasonably possible but not probable that additional funding obligations may exist with an estimated amount of approximately million  no charge has been recorded for these amounts as of october  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  we adopted the required accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions on november  in accordance with this guidance
