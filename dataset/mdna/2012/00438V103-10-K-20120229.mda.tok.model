overview our background accretive health is a leading provider of services that help healthcare providers generate sustainable improvements in their operating margins and healthcare quality while also enhancing patient  physician and staff satisfaction across our three offerings revenue cycle management  quality and total cost of care and physician advisory services 
we deliver these results by implementing our distinctive operating model which leverages our extensive management expertise  leading edge technology and process excellence 
our integrated revenue cycle technology and services offering spans the entire revenue cycle 
we help our revenue cycle customers increase the portion of the maximum potential patient revenue they receive  while reducing total revenue cycle costs 
to implement our solutions  we assume full responsibility for the management and cost of the operations we have contracted to manage and supplement the customer s existing staff involved in such operations with seasoned accretive health personnel 
a customer s revenue improvements and cost savings generally increase over time as we deploy additional programs and as the programs we implement become more effective  which in turn provides visibility into our future revenue and profitability 
we and our customers share financial gains resulting from our solutions  which directly aligns our objectives and interests with those of our customers 
both we and our customers benefit on a contractually agreed upon basis from net revenue increases realized by the customers as a result of our services 
the long term nature of our managed service contracts and the fixed nature of the base fees under each contract provides a core source of recurring revenue 
our quality and total cost of care solution can help our customers identify the individuals who are most likely to experience an adverse health event and  as a result  incur high healthcare costs in the coming year 
this data allows providers to focus greater efforts on managing these patients within and across the delivery system  as well as at home  to create a better care experience 
our physician advisory services offering assists hospitals navigate the path to compliant revenue by providing concurrent level of care classification reviews  as well as retrospective chart audits utilizing highly skilled physicians 
this proactive case management increases our customer s compliance with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms and commercial payor policies and reduces their exposure to the risk of having to return previously recorded revenue our customers typically are multi hospital systems  including faith based or community healthcare systems  academic medical centers and independent ambulatory clinics  and their affiliated physician practice groups 
we believe that current macroeconomic conditions will continue to impose financial pressure on healthcare providers and will increase the importance of managing their operations effectively and efficiently and deliver better care at a lower cost 
additionally  the continued operating pressures facing us hospitals coupled with some of the underlying themes of healthcare reform legislation enacted in march make the efficient management of the revenue cycle and quality and total cost of care initiatives  among the most critical challenges facing healthcare providers today 
our corporate headquarters are located in chicago  illinois  and we operate shared services centers and offices in michigan  illinois  missouri  florida and india 
as of december   we had  full time employees and part time employees  and managed approximately  of our customers employees who are involved in patient registration  health management information  procedure coding  billing and collections 
we refer to these functions collectively as the revenue cycle  and to the personnel involved in a customer s revenue cycle as revenue cycle staff 
in evaluating our business performance  our management monitors various financial and non financial metrics 
on a monthly basis  our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other senior leaders monitor our projected contracted annual revenue run rate as described below  net patient revenue under management  aggregate net services revenue  revenue cycle operating costs  corporate level operating expenses  cash flow and adjusted ebitda 
when appropriate  decisions are made regarding action steps to improve these overall operational measures 
our senior operational leaders also monitor the performance of each customer s revenue cycle  quality and total cost of care operations  and physician advisory services operations through ten to twelve hospital specific operating reviews each year 
such reviews typically focus on planned and actual operating results being achieved on behalf of our customers  progress against our operating metrics and planned and actual operating costs for that site 
during these regular reviews  our senior operational leaders communicate to the operating teams suggestions to improve contract and operations performance and monitor the results of previous efforts 
in addition  our senior management also monitors our ability to attract  hire and retain a sufficient number of talented employees to staff our growing business  and the development and performance of our proprietary technology 
we define our projected contracted annual revenue run rate  or pcarr  as the total net services revenue we expect to receive during the subsequent twelve months from all customers under contract 
we report pcarr as a range as it includes estimates concerning our relative success in achieving incentive based payments over the next months 
we believe that pcarr is a useful method to measure our overall business volume at a point in time and changes in the volume of our business over time because it eliminates the timing impact of contract signings within a specific quarterly or annual period 
by way of example  we generally expect that the annual revenues for our revenue cycle management services at contract maturity which is generally reached in three and one half to four years for a representative hospital customer with billion in net patient revenues will be approximately of the provider s net patient revenue  or approximately million  consisting of million of base fees  net of cost savings shared with the customer  and million of incentive fees 
for the same representative hospital customer for our quality and total cost of care service offering  which we introduced in  we currently expect that the annual revenues will be approximately million  consisting of up to million in base fees and up to million in incentive fees 
we generally expect our incentive fees to improve over time as we introduce additional aspects of our operating model and as our predictive analytics improve with additional customer specific details 
therefore  we generally expect our pcarr for a specific customer engagement to increase annually until the contract is operating at maturity levels 
seasonality our quarterly and annual net services revenue generally increased each period due to ongoing expansion in the number of hospitals subject to managed service contracts with us and increases in the amount of incentive payments earned 
the timing of customer additions is not uniform throughout the year 
we also experience fluctuations in incentive payments as a result of patients ability to accelerate or defer elective procedures  particularly around holidays such as thanksgiving and christmas 
generally  incentive payments earned are lower in the first quarter of each year and higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
as a result of incentive payment fluctuations  our adjusted ebitda is typically lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
for example  our adjusted ebitda of million for the quarter ended march  represented only of our million of adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  we expect this seasonality to continue in our business and we believe that first quarter adjusted ebitda will average approximately of full fiscal year adjusted ebitda for the foreseeable future  provided  however  that due to the factors described above  as well as other factors  some of which may be beyond our control  our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
net services revenue we derive our net services revenue primarily from service contracts under which we manage our customers revenue cycle or quality and total cost of care operations 
revenues from managed service contracts consist of base fees and incentive payments base fee revenues represent our contractually agreed annual fees for managing and overseeing our customers revenue cycle or quality and total cost of care operations 
following a comprehensive review of a customer s operations  the customer s base fees are tailored to its specific circumstances and the extent of the customer s operations for which we are assuming operational responsibility  we do not have standardized fee arrangements 
incentive payment revenues for revenue cycle management services represent the amounts we receive by increasing our customers net patient revenue and identifying potential payment sources for patients who are uninsured and underinsured 
these payments are governed by specific formulas contained in the managed service contract with each of our customers 
in general  we earn incentive payments by increasing a customer s actual cash yield as a percentage of the contractual amount owed to such customer for the healthcare services provided 
incentive payment revenues for quality and total cost of care services represent our share of the provider community cost savings for our role in providing the technology infrastructure and for managing the care coordination process 
in addition  we earn revenue from other services  which primarily include revenue from our physician advisory services offering  services provided in our quality and total cost of care business  and  to a lesser extent  our share of revenues associated with the collection of dormant patient accounts more than days old under some of our service contracts 
some of our service contracts entitle customers to receive a share of the cost savings we achieve from operating their revenue cycle 
this share is returned to customers as a reduction in subsequent base fees 
our services revenue is reported net of cost sharing  and we refer to this as our net services revenue 
the following table summarizes the composition of our net services revenue for the year ended december  on a percentage basis year ended december  net base fees for managed service contracts incentive payments for managed service contracts other services total costs of services under our managed service contracts  we assume responsibility for the costs necessary to conduct the customers revenue cycle  physician advisory services or quality and total cost of care operations that we have contracted to manage 
costs of services consist primarily of salaries and benefits of the customers employees engaged in activities which are included in our contract and who are assigned to work on site with us 
under our contracts with our customers  we are responsible for the cost of the salaries and benefits for these employees of our customers 
salaries are paid and benefits are provided to such individuals directly by the customer  instead of adding these individuals to our payroll  because these individuals remain employees of our customers 
salaries and benefits of our employees in our shared services centers these individuals are distinct from on site infused management discussed below and the non payroll costs associated with operating our shared service centers 
costs associated with vendors that provide services integral to the customer s services we are contracted to manage 
operating margin operating margin is equal to net services revenue less costs of services 
our operating model is designed to improve margin under each managed service contract as the contract matures  for several reasons we typically enhance the productivity of a customer s revenue cycle operations over time as we fully implement our technology and procedures and because any overlap between costs of our shared services centers and costs of hospital operations targeted for transition is generally concentrated in the first year of the contract 
incentive payments under each managed service contract generally increase over time as we deploy additional programs and the programs we implement become more effective and produce improved results for our customers 
infused management and technology expenses we refer to our management and staff employees that we devote on site to customer operations as infused management 
infused management and technology expenses consist primarily of the wages  bonuses  benefits  share based compensation  travel and other costs associated with deploying our employees on customer sites to guide and manage our customers revenue cycle or population health management operations 
the employees we deploy on customer sites typically have significant experience in revenue cycle operations  care coordination  technology  quality control or other management disciplines 
the other significant portion of these expenses is an allocation of the costs associated with maintaining  improving and deploying our integrated proprietary technology suite and an allocation of the costs previously capitalized for developing our integrated proprietary technology suite 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses for executive  sales  corporate information technology  legal  regulatory compliance  selected physician advisory services costs  finance and human resources personnel  including wages  bonuses  benefits and share based compensation  fees for professional services  share based expense for stock warrants  insurance premiums  facility charges  and other corporate expenses 
professional services consist primarily of external legal  tax and audit services 
the costs of developing the processes and technology for our emerging quality and total cost of care service offering prior to november when we signed our inaugural client were also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add sales and marketing  information technology  human resources  finance  accounting and other administrative personnel as we expand our business 
although we cannot predict future changes to the laws and regulations affecting us or the healthcare industry generally  we will efficiently implement associated changes to our compliance programs to minimize the effect on our selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income expense interest income is derived from the return achieved from our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense for the year ended december  resulted from origination fees associated with our revolving line of credit  which we entered into on september  income taxes income tax expense consists of federal and state income taxes in the united states and india 
a large portion of our operations is conducted in michigan  which in began to impose a tax based on gross receipts in addition to tax based on net income 
although we continued to pay the michigan gross receipts tax in  our effective tax rate declined to approximately in  principally due to the release of million of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate in was due principally to the gross receipts taxes paid to the state of michigan and  to a lesser extent  other states 
in the summer of  a change in legislation substantially reduced the requirement for us to pay taxes on any future gross receipts in michigan 
in our effective tax rate was approximately 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to be approximately in future years and increase in absolute dollars as our income increases 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements reflect the assets  liabilities and results of operations of accretive health  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable given our operating environment 
estimates are based on our best knowledge of current events and the actions we may undertake in the future 
although we believe all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation have been included  our actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe that the accounting policies described below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our managed service contracts generally have an initial term of four to five years and various start and end dates 
after the initial terms  these contracts renew annually unless canceled by either party 
revenue from managed service contracts consists of base fees and incentive payments 
we record revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition 
as a result  we only record revenue once there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the amount of revenue has become fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize base fee revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the managed service contract 
base fees for contracts which are received in advance of services delivered are classified as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until services have been provided 
some of our service contracts entitle customers to receive a share of the cost savings achieved from operating their revenue cycle 
this share is credited to the customers as a reduction in subsequent base fees 
services revenue is reported net of cost sharing and is referred to as net services revenue 
our managed service contracts generally allow for adjustments to the base fee 
adjustments typically occur at  or days after the contract commences  but can also occur at subsequent dates as a result of factors including changes to the scope of operations and internal and external audits 
all adjustments  the timing of which is often dependent on factors outside our control and which can increase or decrease revenue and operating margin  are recorded in the period the changes are known and collectibility of any additional fees is reasonably assured 
any such adjustments may cause our quarter to quarter results of operations to fluctuate 
adjustments may vary in direction  frequency and magnitude and generally have not materially affected our annual revenue trends  margin trends  and visibility 
we record revenue for incentive payments once the calculation of the incentive payment earned is finalized and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we use a proprietary technology and methodology to calculate the amount of benefit each customer receives as a result of our services 
our calculations are based in part on the amount of revenue each customer is entitled to receive from commercial and private insurance carriers  medicare  medicaid and patients 
because the laws  regulations  instructions  payor contracts and rule interpretations governing how our customers receive payments from these parties are complex and change frequently  estimates of a customer s prior period benefits could change 
all changes in estimates are recorded when new information is available and calculations are completed 
incentive payments are based on the benefits a customer has received throughout the life of the managed service contract with us 
each quarter  we record the increase in the total benefits received to date 
if a quarterly calculation indicates that the cumulative benefits to date have decreased  we record a reduction in revenue 
if the decrease in revenue exceeds the amount previously paid by the customer  the excess is recorded as deferred revenue 
the revenue for the physician advisory services is recognized once each consultation has been completed and is recorded on a per case basis 
our services also include collection of dormant patient accounts receivable that have aged days or more directly from individual patients 
we share all cash generated from these collections with our customers in accordance with specified arrangements 
we record as revenue our portion of the cash received from these collections when each customer s cash application is complete 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we assess our customers creditworthiness as a part of our customer acceptance process 
we maintain an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce our gross accounts receivable to the amount that we believe will be collected 
this allowance is based on our historical experience  our continuing assessment of each customer s ability to pay  the length of time a balance has been outstanding and the status of any ongoing operations with each applicable customer 
we perform quarterly reviews and analyses of each customer s outstanding balance and assess  on an account by account basis  whether the allowance for doubtful accounts needs to be adjusted based on currently available evidence such as historical collection experience  current economic trends  past due status and changes in customer payment terms 
we consider a receivable to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement 
in accordance with our policy  if collection efforts have been pursued and all avenues for collections exhausted  accounts receivable would be written off as uncollectible 
software development we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification  or asc   intangibles goodwill and other internal use software  which requires the capitalization of costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
in accordance with asc  we capitalize the costs of internally developed  internal use software when an application is in the development stage 
this generally occurs after the overall design and functionality of the application has been approved and our management has committed to the application s development 
capitalized software development costs consist of payroll and payroll related costs for employee time spent developing a specific internal use software application or related enhancements  and external costs incurred that are related directly to the development of a specific software application 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for future income tax consequences that are attributable to differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the income tax bases of such assets and liabilities 
we base the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on enacted tax rates that we expect will apply to taxable income in the year we expect to settle or recover those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of any change in income tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and in all prior periods  a valuation allowance was provided for all of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of our improved operations  in we determined that it was no longer necessary to maintain a valuation allowance for all of our deferred tax assets 
at december    and  the primary sources of our deferred taxes were differences in timing of depreciation on fixed assets  the timing of revenue recognition arising from incentive payments  employee compensation expense arising from stock options and accrued bonuses  and costs associated with the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
tax positions taken or expected to be taken that are not recognized under the pronouncement are recorded as liabilities 
interest and penalties relating to income taxes are recognized in our income tax provision in the statements of consolidated operations 
share based compensation expense our share based compensation expense results from issuances of shares of restricted common stock and grants of stock options and warrants to employees  directors  outside consultants  customers  vendors and others 
we recognize the costs associated with option  restricted stock and warrant grants using the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
generally  asc requires the value of share based payments to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their estimated fair value at date of grant amortized over the grant s vesting period 
restricted stock plan 
our restricted stock plan was adopted by our board of directors in march  amended in june  august and february as of december   all shares of common stock outstanding under our restricted stock plan were vested 
we did not record any share based compensation expense in   or relating to these issuances 
ascension health stock and warrants 
in october  ascension health became our founding customer 
since then  in exchange for its initial start up assistance and subsequent sales and marketing assistance  we have issued common stock and granted warrants to ascension health  as described below initial stock issuance and protection warrant agreement 
in october and november  we issued  shares of common stock to ascension health  then representing a ownership interest in our company on a fully diluted basis  and entered into a protection warrant agreement under which ascension health was granted the right to purchase additional shares of common stock from time to time for per share when ascension health s ownership interest in our company declined below due to our issuance of additional stock or rights to purchase stock 
the protection warrant agreement expired on the closing of our initial public offering in may we made the initial stock grant and entered into the protection warrant agreement because ascension health agreed to provide us with an operational laboratory and related start up consulting services in connection with our development of our initial revenue cycle management service offering 
in  we granted ascension health the right to purchase  shares of common stock for per share  pursuant to the protection warrant agreement 
accordingly  we reduced the amount of our base fee revenues from ascension health by million in we accounted for the costs associated with these purchase rights as a reduction in base fee revenues due to us from ascension health because we could not reasonably estimate the fair value of the services provided by ascension health 
there were no grants associated with this agreement during or and no costs were recorded 
as of december  and  there were no protection warrants outstanding and no additional warrant rights may be earned under this agreement 
for additional information regarding these contract provisions  see related person transactions transactions with ascension health caption included in our proxy statement 
supplemental warrant 
pursuant to a supplemental warrant agreement that became effective in november  ascension health had the right to purchase up to  shares of our common stock based upon the achievement of specified milestones relating to its sales and marketing assistance 
the supplemental warrant agreement expired on the closing of our initial public offering in may during march  ascension health earned the right to purchase  shares of common stock for per share  and we recorded million in marketing expense 
no warrants were earned during years ended december  and ascension health was issued  shares of common stock as a result of cashless exercise of outstanding supplemental warrants during the year ended december  the supplemental warrant with respect to  shares of common stock expired in connection with our initial public offering 
as of december  and  there were no supplemental warrants outstanding  no additional warrant rights may be earned under the supplemental warrant agreement 
licensing and consulting warrant 
in conjunction with the start of our business  in february  we executed a term sheet with a consulting firm and its principal  zimmerman llc formerly known as zimmerman and associates and michael zimmerman  respectively  contemplating that we would grant to mr 
zimmerman a warrant  with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock upon grant  to purchase shares of our common stock then representing of our equity in exchange for exclusive rights to certain revenue cycle methodologies  tools  technology  benchmarking information and other intellectual property  plus up to another of our equity at the time of grant if the firm s introduction of us to senior executives at prospective customers resulted in the execution of managed service contracts between us and such customers 
in january  we formalized the license and warrant grant contemplated by the term sheet and granted to mr 
zimmerman a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share  representing of our equity at that time 
in december  mr 
zimmerman and the trusts exercised the warrant rights in full to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share 
as of december  and  the warrant was no longer outstanding and no additional warrant rights may be earned under this agreement 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of the above purchase rights at the date earned 
the following table sets forth the significant assumptions used in the model during year ended december  future dividends risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life years expected life applies to ascension health s supplemental warrant only  since the other warrants were fully vested upon grant 
stock option plans 
in december  our board of directors approved a stock option plan  which provided for the grant of stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
the plan was amended and restated in february and further amended in may  october  january and november in april  we adopted a new stock incentive plan  or the plan  which became effective immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering and  accordingly  no further stock option grants will be made under the plan 
the plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options  non statutory stock options  restricted stock awards rsas and other stock based awards 
as of december   an aggregate of  shares were subject to outstanding options under both plans  and  shares were available for grant 
in the third quarter of  the company began to grant restricted stock awards to its employees  no such awards were granted in the years ended december  and to the extent that previously granted awards under the plan or plan expire  terminate or are otherwise surrendered  cancelled  forfeited  or repurchased by us  the number of shares available for future awards under the plan will increase  up to a maximum of  shares 
under the terms of both plans  all options will expire if they are not exercised within ten years after the grant date 
substantially all of the options vest over four years at a rate of per year on each grant anniversary date 
options granted under the plan can be exercised immediately upon grant  but upon exercise the shares issued are subject to the same vesting and repurchase provisions that applied before the exercise 
options granted under the plan cannot be exercised prior to vesting 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of each option as of its grant date 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
the following table sets forth the significant assumptions used in the black scholes model to calculate stock based compensation expense for grants made during  and year ended december  future dividends risk free interest rate to to and expected volatility expected life years years years forfeitures annually annually annually as a newly public company  it is not practical for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share prices based on our limited public trading history 
therefore  we estimated the expected volatility by reviewing the historical volatility of the common stock of public companies that operate in similar industries or were similar in terms of stage of development or size and then projecting this information toward our future expected results 
we used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as in evaluating the available historical and implied volatility for these companies 
we aggregated all employees into one pool for valuation purposes 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the plan was not in existence a sufficient period for us to have used our historical experience to estimate expected life 
furthermore  data from other companies was not readily available 
therefore  we estimated our stock options expected life using a simplified method based on the average of each option s vesting term and original contractual term 
an estimated forfeiture rate derived from our historical data and our estimates of the likely future actions of option holders was applied when recognizing the share based compensation expense of the options 
we continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our share based compensation on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the black scholes pricing model 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to total share based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
in addition  any changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period that the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
these adjustments will affect our infused management and technology expenses  cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
for service based equity awards  which represent all outstanding option and restricted stock grants as of december   compensation expense is recognized  net of forfeitures  using a straight line method over the applicable vesting period 
quarterly  the stock based compensation expense is adjusted to reflect of expense for options that vested during the period 
the allocation of this cost between cost of services  selling  general and administrative expenses and infused management and technology expenses depends on the salaries and work assignments of the personnel holding these stock options 
prior to our initial public offering  stock options represented the right to purchase shares of our non voting common stock 
all outstanding non voting common stock converted into voting common stock on a share for share basis effective may   and accordingly  stock options to purchase non voting common stock represent stock options to purchase voting common stock  with no other changes in their terms 
as of december  there was million of total  unrecognized share based compensation cost related to stock options and rsas granted under the plans  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
the allocation of this cost between cost of services  selling  general and administrative expenses and infused management and technology expenses will depend on the salaries and work assignments of the personnel holding these stock options 
determination of fair value 
valuing the share price of a privately held company is complex 
we believe that prior to our initial public offering we used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions in assessing and determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
prior to our initial public offering  we determined the fair value of our common stock through periodic internal valuations that were approved by our board of directors 
the fair value approved by our board was used for all option grants until such time as a new determination of fair value was made 
to date  and as permitted by our stock option plan  our chief executive officer has selected option recipients and determined the number of shares covered by  and the timing of  option grants 
our stock valuations used a combination of the market comparable approach and the income approach to estimate an enterprise value of our company at each valuation date 
our board considered the following factors when determining the fair value of our common stock our financial condition  sales levels and results of operations during the relevant period  developments in our business  hiring of key personnel  forecasts of our financial results and market conditions affecting our industry  market values  sales levels and results of operations for public companies that we consider comparable in terms of size  service offerings and maturity  the superior rights and preferences of outstanding securities that were senior to our common stock  and the illiquid nature of our common stock 
there is inherent uncertainty in the forecasts and projections that were used in our common stock valuations prior to our initial public offering 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates than those described above  the amount of our share based compensation expense  net income or loss and related per share amounts could have been materially different 
for grants following the initial public offering  we utilized market based share prices of our common stock in the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our common stock option awards 
the black scholes model involves a number of highly subjective estimates such as the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated forfeitures over the applicable vesting period  and the estimated volatility of our common stock over the expected term 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings or regulatory investigations 
we evaluate the need for loss accruals using the requirements of asc  contingencies 
when conducting this evaluation we consider factors such as the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we record an estimated loss for any claim  lawsuit  investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  then we record the minimum amount in the range as our loss accrual 
if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded

credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations 
liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations as they come due 
we seek to limit our exposure to credit risk through efforts to reduce our customer concentration and our quarterly assessment of customer creditworthiness  and to liquidity risk by managing our cash flows

recent accounting pronouncements in  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in fasb asc the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
together  these changes are likely to result in earlier recognition of revenue and related costs for multiple element arrangements than under the previous guidance 
this guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the revised multiple element revenue arrangements guidance will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   however  early adoption is permitted  provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we adopted this asu as of january  the adoption did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  and asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendment to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which amend guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity will be eliminated 
although the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing guidance 
these asus are effective for interim annual reporting periods beginning after december  and retrospective application will be required 
these asus will change our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact net income  financial position  or cash flows 
in  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the asu also expands upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the asu is effective for the company beginning with its first interim period  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect this adoption to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income is primarily generated from interest earned on operating cash accounts 
our exposure to market risks related to interest expense is limited to outstanding letters of credit under our revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the greater of the bank established prime commercial rate  a libor plus rate  or a rate that combines the characteristics of both 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps  caps or collars or other hedging instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the indian rupee because a portion of our operating expenses are incurred by our subsidiary in india and are denominated in indian rupees 
however  we do not generate any revenues outside of the united states 
for the years ended december    and    and respectively  of our expenses were denominated in indian rupees 
as a result  we believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial
