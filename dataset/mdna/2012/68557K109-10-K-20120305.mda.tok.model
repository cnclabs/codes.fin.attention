through its unique rewards program  hotelclub rewards  members earn member rewards of up to of the value of every booking made  which can then be redeemed on future hotel bookings 
private label we offer third parties  such as airlines and hotel partners  a full range of private label solutions  ranging from the building and hosting of custom websites to supplying content feeds with availability and rate data to partners websites 
we license our technology and business services to these partners  and using our technology  these partners are able to provide a wide range of travel products on their websites under their own brands 
we pay commissions to our third party partners based on the revenue generated by their websites 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our private label channel through the addition of new partners 
for example  in  we announced a partnership with american express to provide private label services for the american express consumer travel network  which we expect to launch in the second half of partner marketing through our partner marketing programs  we generate advertising revenue by providing our partners access to our customer base through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising and other marketing programs 
travel companies  convention and visitor bureaus  credit card partners  media  packaged goods and other non travel advertisers all advertise on our websites 
merchant and retail models we generate revenue primarily from the booking of travel products and services on our websites 
we provide customers the ability to book travel products and services on both a stand alone basis and as part of a vacation package  primarily through our merchant and retail business models 
merchant model our merchant model provides customers the ability to book air travel  hotels  car rentals  destination services and vacation packages 
hotel transactions comprise the majority of our merchant bookings 
we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
we may  depending upon the brand and the product  earn revenue by charging our customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is higher under the merchant model compared with the retail model due to our ability to negotiate net rates with suppliers 
customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  and we pay our suppliers at a later date  which is generally when the customer uses the reservation  except in the case of merchant air where payment may occur prior to the consumption date 
initially  we record these customer receipts as accrued merchant payables and either deferred income or net revenue  depending on the travel product 
the timing difference between when the cash is collected from our customers and when payments are made to our suppliers improves our operating cash flow and represents a source of liquidity for us 
we recognize net revenue under the merchant model when we have no further obligations to the customer 
for merchant air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for merchant hotel transactions and merchant car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively 
the timing of revenue recognition is different for merchant air travel because our primary service to the customer is fulfilled at the time of booking 
in the merchant model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  however we are subject to charge backs and fraud risk  which we monitor closely  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room or car rental  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
when customers assemble vacation packages  we may offer the customer the ability to book a combination of travel products that use both the merchant model and the retail model 
vacation packages allow us to make products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking each travel product separately 
our net revenue per transaction is generally higher for vacation packages than for travel products booked separately 
retail model our retail model provides customers the ability to book air travel  hotels  car rentals and cruises 
air transactions comprise the majority of our retail bookings 
under the retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
we generally receive these commissions 
table of contents from suppliers after the customer uses the travel reservation 
we may  depending upon the brand and the product  earn revenue by charging customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is lower under the retail model compared with the merchant model 
however  airline tickets booked under the retail model contribute substantially to our overall gross bookings and net revenue due to the high volume of airline tickets booked on our websites 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card and we have no further obligations to the customer 
for air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for hotel transactions and car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively  net of an allowance for cancelled reservations 
in the retail model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
global distribution systems and supplier relationships global distribution systems global distribution systems gdss provide us access to a comprehensive set of supplier content through a single source 
suppliers  such as airlines and hotels  utilize gdss to connect their product and service offerings with travel providers  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
certain of our businesses utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus it group amadeus 
under our gds service agreements  we receive revenue in the form of an incentive payment for air  car and hotel segments that are processed through a gds 
galileo and worldspan are subsidiaries of travelport  and we have an agreement with travelport that covers the gds services provided by both galileo and worldspan 
this agreement contains volume requirements for the number of segments that we must process through galileo and worldspan and requires us to make shortfall payments if we do not process the required minimum number of segments for a given year 
as a result  a significant portion of our gds services are provided by travelport gdss 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of incentive revenue for segments processed through galileo and worldspan  which accounted for more than of our total net revenue 
supplier relationships we work with our suppliers to provide our customers with a broad and deep range of highly competitive travel products and services on our websites 
we have teams that manage relationships and negotiate agreements with our suppliers 
these agreements generally cover access to the supplier s travel inventory as well as payment for our services 
our teams cover air  hotel  car rental  cruise  travel insurance and destination services suppliers 
our teams focus on managing relationships  obtaining supplier sponsored promotions and negotiating contracts 
for hotels  we are focused on offering our customers the ability to book the most relevant hotels at the most competitive prices 
to do this  we are focused on improving our infrastructure to ensure we have appropriate connectivity with our suppliers  sophisticated sort order algorithms and robust promotional capabilities 
we have a global hotel services team that works closely with chains and independent hotels to increase the number of properties that participate on our websites and works with hotels to ensure that our customers have access to their best available prices 
for airlines  we have long standing and  we believe  generally good relationships with our suppliers 
the airlines  however  continue to look for ways to decrease their overall costs  including the cost of distributing airline tickets through otcs and gdss  and to increase their control over distribution by taking actions such as pursuing direct connect strategies  limiting forward distribution of their fares to meta search providers  such as kayak  and limiting the extent to which certain fare classes may be used in the construction of multi carrier itineraries 
to date  our economics under the terms of our air agreements have generally been stable 
in february  we signed a multi year marketing and distribution agreement with united airlines that gives orbitz 
com  cheaptickets and orbitz for business customers access to all united and continental fares  schedules and inventory 
however  in december  american airlines aa removed its content from our websites in connection with its pursuit of a direct connect relationship with us 
in june  as a result of a favorable ruling in litigation  aa s content was reinstated on our websites 
in the third quarter of  we and our gds partner  travelport  agreed with aa to keep aa s content on our websites until march   and in march  we entered into a letter agreement with aa pursuant to which aa agreed to keep its content on our websites until october  to the extent we are unable to reach an acceptable longer term commercial arrangement with aa or if the economics of our arrangements with other airlines deteriorate  in the long term  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected  potentially materially 
we intend to continue to work with our suppliers  including aa  to provide our customers with a highly competitive product offering

the master license agreement granted us the right to use a corporate online booking product developed by travelport 
we have entered into a value added reseller license with travelport for this product 

table of contents the master license agreement generally includes the right to create derivative works and other improvements 
other than the unrestricted use of our supplier link technology  travelport is generally prohibited from sublicensing these technologies to any third party for competitive use 
however  travelport and its affiliates are not restricted from using the technologies to compete directly with us 
information about segments and geographic areas we operate and manage our business as a single operating segment 
for geographic related information  see note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
industry conditions general the worldwide travel industry is a large and dynamic industry that has been characterized by rapid and significant change 
the global economy experienced a prolonged recession during late and throughout that significantly impacted the travel industry 
although the economy has significantly improved  the presence of high unemployment rates and related pressure on consumer spending  recent natural disasters and related travel disruptions  and perceived uncertainty about the state of the global economy continues to cause uncertainty and volatility in the market 
as a result  we have limited visibility into when travel industry fundamentals will fully recover 
we compete in various geographic markets  with our primary markets being the united states  europe and asia pacific 
within the united states  the most mature of the global travel markets  the growth rate of online travel bookings has slowed  due to both the maturity of the market and the weak economy  yet continues to rebound 
according to phocuswright  an independent travel  tourism and hospitality research firm  the online travel booking penetration rate in the united states was nearly in we are one of the market leaders within the united states due to the strength of our air business  which we are leveraging to gain market share in the global hotel marketplace 
internationally  the european and asia pacific markets are characterized by their high level of fragmentation  particularly in the hotel industry 
both the european and asia pacific markets continue to benefit from increases in internet usage rates and growing acceptance of online booking  which has partially offset the negative effects of the weak economy 
in europe  we have improved our scale over the past few years and are positioned to aggressively compete 
growth in the asia pacific market is also a primary focus for us  as it represents a region with significant growth opportunity where our competition is not as entrenched 
according to phocuswright  the online travel booking penetration rates was almost for europe and asia pacific was just over for competition the general market for travel products and services is highly competitive 
the online travel industry generally has low barriers to entry and competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost 
our current competitors include online travel companies  traditional offline travel companies  suppliers  travel research companies  search engines and meta search companies 
in addition  we compete internationally with smaller regional operators 
the companies that we compete with include the following among online travel companies  our major competitors primarily include expedia 
com  hotels 
com  hotwire 
com and venere 
com  which are owned by expedia  inc  travelocity 
com and lastminute 
com  which are owned by sabre holdings corporation  priceline 
com  booking 
com and agoda 
com  which are owned by priceline 
com incorporated  opodo 
com  which is owned by amadeus  rakuten 
com  which is owned by rakuten  inc  and wotif 
com and asiawebdirect 
com  which are owned by wotif 
com holdings limited 
in the offline travel company category  our largest competitors include companies such as liberty travel  inc  thomas cook group plc and tui travel plc 
we compete with suppliers  such as airlines  hotel and rental car companies  many of which have their own branded websites and toll free numbers through which they generate business 
we compete with travel research companies such as tripadvisor llc and travelzoo inc  through which consumers can access content such as user generated travel reviews 
travel research companies also send customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
we compete with search engines including google  bing  yahoo and meta search companies such as kayak 
search and meta search websites are capable of sending consumers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 

table of contents suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites in lieu of using third parties 
suppliers who sell on their own websites offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points  which may make their offerings more attractive than our offerings to some consumers 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
seasonality our businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
the majority of our customers book leisure travel rather than business travel 
gross bookings for leisure travel are generally highest in the first half of the year as customers plan and book their spring and summer vacations 
however  net revenue generated under the merchant model is generally recognized when the travel takes place and typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first half of the year and our net revenue is typically highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
our seasonality may also be affected by fluctuations in the travel products our suppliers make available to us for booking  the growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix 
company strategy our mission is to unlock the joy of travel by becoming the travel expert for the world  where our customers easily find and book personalized travel options 
given that the hotel marketplace is approximately billion and the online market continues to be highly fragmented with low penetration rates  we believe this presents an opportunity to significantly improve consumer experience and grow our business  leveraging our global platform 
in february  with the successful migration of the remaining air  car and dynamic package paths of orbitz 
com  we completed our global platform migration  a multi year initiative to bring all of our consumer brands onto a common technology platform 
during the second half of  we migrated our cheaptickets and hotelclub brands to the global platform 
we believe this technology platform provides meaningful improvements to both the speed and customer shopping experience on our websites and enables us to deliver innovation to our customers more quickly 
in conjunction with our migration efforts  we have been focused on enhancing the consumer experience with the development of tools and technologies to help users easily research travel options and by improving the quality of the content we make available such as user reviews  editorial descriptions  photographs and virtual tours 
we are now poised to take full advantage of having all of our consumer businesses on a common platform  and we are therefore able to focus our product and technology investments in a number of key areas that we expect to drive performance improvements 
our key areas of focus and investment are marketing optimization  funnel optimization and enhancing mobile offerings 
marketing optimization we are focused on marketing optimization to drive consumers to our websites in a cost effective manner 
we successfully brought our sem bidding for orbitz  cheaptickets and hotelclub in house in with the launch of kobe  our keyword optimized bidding engine 
with our continued development of kobe and its application across other marketing channels  including tripadvisor  we are seeing improvements in marketing efficiency with early results showing more transactions for a given spend level and or less spend required to generate a given number of transactions and are striving for increased efficiencies going forward 
we are also actively pursuing strategies to increase the amount of traffic coming to our websites through seo  crm  our private label channel and orbitz for business 
our goal is to further increase brand awareness and loyalty so that consumers come directly to our websites to book their travel  which we also promote with offline marketing as well as with social media 
in addition  our promotions  including orbitz insider steals and mobile steals  provide significant value for consumers while generating a high volume of transactions 
funnel optimization now that all of our consumer brands are on a common platform  we are dedicating resources to take advantage of its new capabilities in order to further improve the user experience through funnel optimization 
that is  we are focused on creating a streamlined and personalized shopping experience for our users that will make it even easier and faster for them to find and book travel 
our particular areas of investment include tailoring custom landing pages by traffic source  optimizing core site 
table of contents pages like search results to make it even easier for our customers to find the travel options that are best for them  developing technologies that will allow us to provide customers with more personalized and relevant search results for the specific context of each site visit  and creating a smoother checkout process that will make booking even faster and easier 
mobile offerings we are also focused on our mobile offerings  both in terms of enhancing our existing offerings and launching new mobile applications  and driving more traffic to these distribution channels 
we made significant progress in the growth of our mobile channel in for air  car  dynamic packaging and  in particular  hotel 
in  we launched the hotels by ebookers app for iphone and ipad and the orbitz hotels app for ipad  and we enhanced the orbitz mobile website m 
orbitz 
com 
in early  we launched the orbitz hotels app for iphone 
in december  over of hotel searches across the company s brands were made on mobile devices  up from just in december over the upcoming year  we plan to apply the approach we have taken in our mobile websites and applications for iphone and ipad to air and car bookings  to the android operating system and to delivering a mobile solution for our hotelclub customers 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  more than half of whom were based in the united states and the remaining were based primarily in australia and the united kingdom 
we believe we have a good relationship with our employees

table of contents item a 
risk factors travelport s controlling holders control us and may have strategic interests that differ from ours or our other shareholders 
currently  travelport and investment funds that own and or control travelport s ultimate parent company beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock and therefore  indirectly control us 
as a result of this ownership  travelport s controlling holders are entitled to nominate and elect all of our directors and own sufficient shares to determine the outcome of any actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  including adopting most amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving or rejecting proposed mergers  significant new investments or divestments or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of travelport s controlling holders may differ from those of our public shareholders in material respects 
travelport s controlling holders and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments 
they currently have  and may from time to time in the future acquire  interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers or businesses on which we are substantially dependent  such as the travelport gdss 
in an effort to increase its revenues and improve its overall profitability  travelport could seek to change the terms of its commercial relationships with its gds customers  including us 
because we are limited in our ability to pursue alternative gds options or direct connections with suppliers during the term of our gds agreement with travelport  any such actions by travelport could make us a less attractive distribution channel to our suppliers  who could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us  and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other online travel companies 
see we are dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
in addition  travelport s customers  many of which are also major suppliers to us  have previously sought and may in the future seek to exert commercial leverage over us in an effort to obtain concessions from travelport  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as long as travelport s controlling holders continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting stock  even if that amount is less than  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control us 
the interests of these holders may differ from our other shareholders interests in material respects 
actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors as well as the management and directors of travelport 
jeff clarke serves as chairman of our board of directors and is the chairman of the travelport board of directors 
mr 
martin j 
brand  who is a managing director at the blackstone group  currently serves on the board of directors of travelport and serves on our board of directors 
the fact that mr 
clarke and mr 
brand hold positions with travelport and us could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when they face decisions that may affect two or more of these entities 
in addition  ms 
jill a 
greenthal  who is a senior advisor in the private equity group of the blackstone group  and mr 
robert l 
friedman  who is a senior managing director of the blackstone group  currently serve on our board of directors 
affiliates of the blackstone group exercise control over travelport s ultimate parent company and therefore  the fact that ms 
greenthal and mr 
friedman hold positions with the blackstone group could create  or appear to create  a potential conflict of interest when either of them face decisions that affect both travelport and us 
further  our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of travelport who is also an officer or director of ours may be liable to us or our stockholders for a breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to travelport instead of us or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to travelport 
these provisions may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between travelport and us because the provisions effectively shield an overlapping director executive 
potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between travelport and us regarding the terms of commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates 
potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any other commercial arrangements with travelport in the future 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation limits our ability to engage in many transactions without the consent of travelport 
our certificate of incorporation provides travelport with a greater degree of control and influence in the operation of our business and the management of our affairs than is typically available to a stockholder of a publicly traded company 
until travelport ceases to beneficially own shares entitled to or more of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our then outstanding common stock  the prior consent of travelport is required for any consolidation or merger of us or any of our subsidiaries with any person  other than a subsidiary  any sale  lease  exchange or other disposition or any acquisition or investment  other than certain permitted investments  by us  other than transactions between us and our subsidiaries  or any series of related dispositions or acquisitions  except for those for which we give travelport at least days prior written notice and which involve consideration not in excess of million in fair market value  except any disposition of cash equivalents or investment grade securities or obsolete or worn out equipment and the lease  assignment or sublease of any real or personal property  in each case  in the ordinary course of business  any change in our authorized capital stock or our creation of any class or series of capital stock  the issuance or sale by us or one of our subsidiaries of any equity securities or equity derivative securities or the adoption of any equity incentive plan  except for the issuance of equity securities by us or one of our subsidiaries to travelport or to another restricted subsidiary of travelport and the issuance by us of equity securities under our equity incentive plans in an amount not to exceed million per year in fair market value  the amendment of various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  the declaration of dividends on any class of our capital stock  the authorization of any series of preferred stock  the creation  incurrence  assumption or guaranty by us or any of our subsidiaries of any indebtedness for borrowed money  except for up to million of indebtedness at any one time outstanding under our credit agreement and up to million of other indebtedness so long as we give travelport at least days prior written notice of the incurrence thereof  the creation  existence or effectiveness of any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction by us or any of our subsidiaries on payment of dividends or other distributions  payment of indebtedness  the making of loans or advances and the sale  lease or transfer of any properties or assets  in each case  to travelport or any of its restricted subsidiaries  any change in the number of directors on our board of directors  the establishment of any committee of the board  the determination of the members of the board or any committee of the board  and the filling of newly created memberships and vacancies on the board or any committee of the board  and any transactions with affiliates of travelport involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of million  except transactions between or among travelport or any of its restricted subsidiaries  including us  the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to  and indemnities provided for the benefit of  officers  directors  employees or consultants of travelport  any of its direct or indirect parent companies or any of its restricted subsidiaries  including us  any agreement as in effect on the date of the consummation of this offering  and investments by the blackstone group and certain of its affiliates in our or our subsidiaries securities so long as i the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or more favorable terms and ii the investment constitutes less than of the proposed or outstanding issue amount of such class of securities 
these restrictions could prevent us from being able to pursue transactions or relationships that would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
these restrictions could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable 
we are dependent on travelport for our gds services 
to varying extents  suppliers use gdss to connect their products and services with travel companies  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
under our gds service agreement with travelport  we are required  subject to certain exceptions  to utilize galileo and worldspan  which are subsidiaries of travelport  for a significant portion of our gds services  and our contractual obligations to travelport for gds services may limit our ability to pursue alternative gds options 
as a result  if travelport became unwilling or was unable to provide these services to us  we may not be able to obtain alternative providers on a commercially reasonable basis  in a timely manner or at all  and our business would 
table of contents be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  our gds service agreement with travelport permits us to pursue direct connect relationships with new or existing suppliers during the term of the agreement  which expires on december   if the travelport gdss do not have material content or if there is a material economic difference between the cost of obtaining supplier content from the travelport gdss relative to a direct connect relationship 
if we pursue a direct connect relationship and travelport disputes our ability to do so under our gds service agreement  we may become involved in a potentially costly and uncertain litigation dispute with travelport 
these contractual obligations may reduce our flexibility to implement changes to our business in response to changing economic conditions  industry trends  or technological developments 
as a result  the limitations imposed by the gds service agreement could place us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our business and results of operations  particularly in the current economic environment where our suppliers are under increased pressure to reduce their overall distribution costs 
we rely on travelport to issue letters of credit on our behalf under its credit facility 
as of december   there were million of outstanding letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf 
under the separation agreement  as amended  the separation agreement  travelport has agreed to issue us dollar denominated letters of credit on our behalf in an aggregate amount not to exceed million so long as travelport and its affiliates as defined therein own at least of our voting stock 
if we do not have a separate letter of credit facility in place in the event travelport is no longer obligated or is unable to issue letters of credit on our behalf  or if we exceed the million limitation  or if we require letters of credit denominated in foreign currencies  we would be required to issue letters of credit under our revolving credit facility or to establish cash reserves  which could significantly reduce our liquidity and cash available to grow our business 
as of december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility  the majority of which were denominated in pounds sterling 
we have granted travelport perpetual licenses to use certain of our intellectual property  which could facilitate travelport s ability to compete with us 
we are party to a master license agreement with travelport that governs each of our and travelport s rights to use certain of the other s intellectual property 
the master license agreement permits travelport and its affiliates to use and  in some cases  to sublicense to third parties certain of our intellectual property  including our supplier link technology  portions of ebookers booking  search and vacation package technologies  certain of our products and online booking tools for corporate travel  portions of our private label vacation package technology  and our extranet supplier connectivity functionality 
travelport and its affiliates may use these technologies as part of  or in support of  their own products or services  including in some cases to directly compete with us 
the master license agreement permits travelport to sublicense our intellectual property other than our supplier link technology to a party that is not an affiliate of travelport  except that travelport may not sublicense our intellectual property to a third party for a use that competes with our business  unless travelport incorporates or uses our intellectual property with travelport products or services to enhance or improve travelport products or services other than to provide our intellectual property to third parties on a stand alone basis 
travelport and its affiliates are permitted to use our intellectual property to provide their own products and services to third parties that compete with us 
with respect to our supplier link technology  travelport has an unrestricted license 
these travelport rights could facilitate travelport s  its affiliates and third parties ability to compete with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our supplier and partner relationships and adverse changes in these relationships or our inability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
we rely significantly on our relationships with hotels  airlines and other suppliers and travel partners 
adverse changes in any of these relationships  or the inability to enter into new relationships  could negatively impact the availability and competitiveness of travel products offered on our websites 
our arrangements with suppliers and other travel partners may not remain in effect on current or similar terms  and the net impact of future pricing or revenue sharing options may adversely 
table of contents impact our revenue 
for example  our suppliers and other travel partners could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us on more favorable terms to them  which could reduce the revenue we generate from those agreements 
the significant reduction by any of our major suppliers or travel partners in their business with our companies for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain airlines may terminate their agreements with us for any reason or no reason prior to the scheduled expiration date upon thirty days prior notice 
globally  airlines continue to look for ways to decrease their overall costs  including the cost of distributing airline tickets through otcs and gdss  and to increase their control over distribution 
for example  effective december  aa removed its content from our orbitz 
com and orbitz for business websites following unsuccessful negotiations in which aa requested  among other things  that we enter into a direct connect relationship 
in  prior to the removal of aa content from our websites  the net revenue associated with aa tickets booked on our orbitz 
com and orbitz for business sites  including ancillary revenue from associated hotels  car rentals  travel insurance and destination services revenue  represented approximately of our total net revenue 
in june  the circuit court of cook county  illinois granted travelport s request for injunctive relief against aa ordering aa to reinstate its content on our websites 
while aa immediately made its full schedule of flights available on both our orbitz 
com and orbitz for business websites as a result of this ruling  it was only required to do so through august   the date on which its distribution agreement with travelport expired 
subsequently  we entered into letter agreements with aa pursuant to which aa is currently prohibited from removing its content from our websites prior to october  in addition  in april  aa filed a lawsuit against travelport and us alleging that our travelport gds service agreement violates the sherman antitrust act 
although the court has dismissed this claim with prejudice  there are several other claims pending against travelport 
it is possible that the outcome of these claims could influence the manner in which gdss operate  which could have significant implications for both airlines and otcs  including potentially forcing us and our competitors to change our business models and putting us at competitive disadvantage to the extent we cannot reach a long term agreement with aa to distribute their tickets 
if we cannot reach a longer term agreement with aa or if other airlines pursue a similar distribution strategy  it could reduce our access to air inventory  put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other otcs  reduce our compensation  create additional operating expenses related to the development  implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology systems to direct connect  increase the frequency or duration of system problems  reduce our ability to attract or retain business customers  and or delay other projects 
on march   due to the expiration of our agreement with hilton hotels hilton  we stopped offering certain hilton inventory and reduced the prominence of hilton properties on our websites 
this will likely reduce the volume of our hilton hotel transactions 
during the year ended december   hilton represented approximately of our total net revenue 
while we do not believe the situation with hilton will have a material impact on our business  if we are unable to reach a new agreement with hilton or replace hilton bookings with bookings of other hotels  or if our relationships with other major hotel chains also deteriorate  it could reduce our access to hotel inventory  put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other otcs  reduce our ability to attract or retain corporate customers  and or have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are also subject to minimum segment volume thresholds and may be subject to shortfall payments to travelport if we fail to process a certain percentage of segments through the gdss 
however  we are not subject to these minimum volume thresholds to the extent that we process all eligible segments through the travelport gdss  including segments processed through a permitted direct connect relationship under certain circumstances discussed above 
these minimum segment volume thresholds effectively limit our ability to enter into  or expand  relationships with other partners  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
our liquidity has been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted 
the weak and volatile conditions in the global financial markets and financial sector caused a substantial deterioration in the capital markets in late and early we experienced the negative effects of this instability when lehman commercial paper inc lcpi filed for bankruptcy in october lcpi held a million commitment under our revolving credit facility  and its bankruptcy effectively reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
in the last half of  the capital markets improved and in january  par investment partners  lp exchanged million aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement for  shares of our common stock  and travelport concurrently purchased  shares of our common stock for million in cash  which improved our overall liquidity 
however  in the future  our liquidity could be negatively impacted as a result of the termination of any major supplier s participation on our websites  a decline in merchant gross bookings resulting from changes in our merchant business model  economic conditions or other factors  changes to payment terms or other requirements imposed by vendors  suppliers or regulatory agencies  such as requiring us to provide letters of 
table of contents credit  cash reserves or other forms of financial security or increases in such requirements  lower than anticipated operating cash flows  or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings  including in the case of hotel occupancy proceedings  certain jurisdictions requirements that we provide financial security or pay an assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the assessment in court  or our inability to recover defense costs 
if in the future  we require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility  or we are unable to refinance or extend our revolving credit facility by its maturity date in july  or we are unable to refinance or repay our term loan by its july maturity date  we cannot be certain that other funding would be available to us or be available on attractive or acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of potential business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could limit the manner in which we operate our business 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement 
our substantial level of indebtedness could impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  reduce the funds available to us for purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures because we are required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments  put us at a competitive disadvantage because we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in the economy or our industry  including increased competition  and make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio 
if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
if this were to occur  there is no assurance that alternative financing would be available to us or at favorable terms 
in addition  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement specifically limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make new investments  loans or acquisitions  grant or incur liens on our assets  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make restricted payments 
as a result  we may operate our business differently than if we were not subject to these covenants and restrictions 
our revenue is derived from the travel industry and prolonged substantial decreases in travel volume  particularly air travel  as well as other industry trends  have historically adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue is derived from the worldwide travel industry 
as a result  our revenue is directly related to the overall level of travel activity  particularly air travel volume  and is therefore significantly impacted by declines in or disruptions to travel in the united states  europe and the asia pacific region due to factors entirely outside of our control 
for example  the deterioration of the capital markets and related financial crisis in the second half of negatively impacted consumer spending patterns  including spending on travel  thereby reducing demand for our products and decreasing our revenue 
while we have recently seen improvements in the economy  the timing and sustainability of a recovery is uncertain 
if economic 
table of contents conditions do not continue to improve  or worsen  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
additional factors that affect our revenue include general economic conditions  global security issues  political instability  acts or threats of terrorism  hostilities or war and other political issues that could adversely affect travel volume in our key regions  epidemics or pandemics  natural disasters  such as hurricanes  volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  the financial condition of suppliers  including the airline and hotel industry  and the impact of their financial condition on the cost and availability of air travel and hotel rooms  changes in airline distribution policies  changes to regulations governing the airline and travel industry  fuel prices  work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major airlines or airports  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  travelers perceptions of the occurrence of travel related accidents or the scope  severity and timing of the other factors described above  and changes in occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels 
if there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes  particularly for air travel and hotel stays  for these or any other reasons  it would have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if one or more of our major suppliers  including airlines and car rental companies  suffers a deterioration in its financial condition or it restructures its operations 
in the past several years  several major airlines have filed for bankruptcy protection  recently exited bankruptcy  discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy or have merged with other airlines 
in addition  the economic downturn severely impacted the automobile industry  including car rental companies 
we depend on a relatively small number of airlines for a significant portion of our net revenue 
our car net revenue is also generated from a relatively small number of car rental companies 
as a result of this dependence  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of the major airlines or car rental companies were to deteriorate or in the event of supplier consolidation in either of these industries 
for example  a consolidation of one or more of the major airlines  such as the merger of united air lines  inc and continental airlines  inc and the merger of southwest airlines co 
southwest and airtran airways  could result in further capacity reductions  a reduction in the number of airline tickets available for booking on our website and increased air fares  which may have a negative impact on demand for travel products 
the travel industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future 
we operate in the highly competitive travel industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to compete effectively against numerous competitors  including other online travel companies  traditional offline travel companies  suppliers  travel research companies  search engines and meta search companies  several of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we have 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
if we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites 
some airlines  such as southwest  have historically only distributed their tickets through their own websites and do not use third party distributors 
delta air lines  inc in recent years eliminated sales of airline tickets through several third party distributors  limited forward distribution of their fares to meta search providers  such as kayak  and limited the extent to which certain fare classes may be used in the construction of multi carrier itineraries  all in an attempt to drive customers to book directly on its website 
suppliers may offer advantages for customers to book directly  such as member only fares  bonus miles or loyalty points  which could make their offerings more attractive to customers 
certain online travel companies  including us  reduced or eliminated domestic booking fees on retail airline tickets and hotel stays and removed certain change and cancellation fees 
our results of 
table of contents operations could be negatively affected if competitive dynamics in the industry caused us to further reduce or eliminate the service fees we charge our customers 
if we are unable to implement changes to our business in an effort to absorb the impact of the reduction or elimination of these fees or are unable to increase revenue from other sources  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
search and meta search sites have also grown in popularity and may drive more traffic directly to the websites of suppliers or competitors 
google appears to have increased its focus on appealing to travel customers through its launch of google places and google flights 
in addition  google s efforts around google places could lead to it favoring google places or a favored partner over and above our pages  which could undermine our ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost  or at all 
google flights is an air travel specific website that promotes air suppliers sites and not those of otcs 
if large search engines gain popularity with their meta search models  customers could visit search sites instead of ours and we may be required to pay for traffic that otherwise would have been free 
in addition  we currently license our search functionality  qpx software  from ita software  inc the acquisition of ita software  inc 
ita by google could result in ita developing new software or other products in the future that it may not make available to us  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
certain of our international subsidiaries have a history of significant operating losses  and our inability to improve their scale and profitability could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have historically incurred significant operating losses at our international subsidiaries and may continue to experience operating losses in the future  particularly since we expect to continue to incur high levels of marketing and other expenses in order to expand our international operations 
as a result  we have made  and may continue to make  significant investments in our international operations by using a portion of the cash flow generated from our domestic operations or making borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our international subsidiaries will be profitable in the future or that any profits generated by them will be sufficient to recover our investments in them 
the profitability of our international subsidiaries depends to a large extent on the scale of their operations 
if we fail to achieve the desired scale  we may not be able to effectively compete in the global marketplace and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to additional risks not encountered when doing business in the united states  including foreign exchange risk  and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 
with employees in over countries outside the united states  we generated of our net revenue for the year ended december  from our international operations 
we are subject to certain risks as a result of having international operations and from having operations in multiple countries generally  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations due to distance  time zones  language and cultural differences  including issues associated with establishing management infrastructure in various countries  differences and unexpected changes in local regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions  limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and increased risk of piracy  preference of local populations for local providers  restrictions on the repatriation of non us investments and earnings back to the united states  including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions  diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to the extent we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations  including  among others  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures to ensure that our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents we are dependent upon third party systems and service providers  and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on certain third party computer systems  service providers and software companies  including the electronic central reservation systems and gdss of the airline  hotel and car rental industries 
in particular  our businesses rely on third parties to conduct searches for airfares  process hotel room transactions  process credit card payments  and provide computer infrastructure critical to our business 
in addition  we rely on a group of business process outsourcing companies located in various countries to provide us with call center and telesales services  back office administrative services such as ticketing fulfillment  hotel rate loading and quality control and information technology services  as well as financial services 
any interruption in these third party services could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  we currently utilize gdss  including worldspan  galileo and amadeus  to process a significant portion of our bookings  and any interruption or deterioration in our gds partners products or services could prevent us from searching and booking airline and car rental reservations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with our technology partners 
in the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated  we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms  which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business 
in addition  some of our agreements with third party service providers can be terminated by those parties on short notice and  in many cases  provide no recourse for service interruptions 
a termination of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness  and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 
we depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems  including technologies and systems utilized for reservations  communications  procurement and administrative systems 
certain of our businesses also utilize third party fare search solutions and gdss or other technologies 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving industry standards while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings and the changing demands of the marketplace 
in particular  expanding our systems and infrastructure to meet any potential increases in business volume will require us to commit additional financial  operational and technical resources before those increases materialize  with no assurance that they actually will 
furthermore  our use of this technology could be challenged by claims that we have infringed upon the patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our existing systems  obtain new technologies and systems  or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost effective manner 
also  we may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system  or we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business could suffer 
system interruptions and the lack of redundancy may cause us to lose customers or business opportunities 
our inability to maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure may result in system interruptions 
system interruptions and slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  prolonged or frequent service outages  or insufficient capacity may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers  which could result in our losing customers and revenue or incurring liabilities 
in addition to the risks associated with inadequate maintenance or upgrading  our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes  including natural disasters  war and acts of terrorism  power losses  computer systems failure  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator error  
table of contents losses and corruption of data  and similar events  computer viruses  penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security  and the failure of third party systems or services that we rely upon to maintain our own operations 
we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations 
for example  if we were unable to connect to certain third party systems  such as gdss  due to failure of our systems  our ability to process bookings could be significantly or completely impaired 
many other systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient 
in addition  we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption  and remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
any extended interruption in our technologies or systems could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our businesses and generate revenue 
we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes  which could harm us 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including  but not limited to  actions relating to intellectual property  in particular patent infringement claims against us  tax matters  employment law and other negligence  breach of contract and fraud claims  that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations 
the defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive 
if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  historically  our insurers have reimbursed us for a significant portion of costs we incurred to defend the hotel occupancy tax cases 
if in the future these costs are reimbursed at a lower rate  or not at all  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be effectively protecting our intellectual property  which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and services 
this could make it more difficult for us to compete with them 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands 
among our significant assets are our software and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect these assets 
however  we have a limited number of patents  and our software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and the laws of some jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the united states 
we have granted travelport an exclusive license to our supplier link technology  including our patents related to that technology 
under the exclusive license  travelport has the first right to enforce those patents  and so we will only be able to bring actions to enforce those patents if travelport declines to do so 
unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 
further  intellectual property challenges have been increasingly brought against members of the travel industry 
these legal actions have in the past  and might in the future  result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  we may need to take legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and these enforcement actions could result in the invalidation or other impairment of intellectual property rights we assert 
our business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events 
new sales  use  occupancy or other tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time 
such enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations and our business and financial performance 
further  existing tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be interpreted  changed  modified or applied adversely to us 
these events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis  as well as require us to pay fees  penalties and or interest for past amounts deemed to be due 
in addition  our revenue may decline because we may have to charge more for our products and services 
new  changed  modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance  operating and other costs  as well as the costs of our products or services 
further  these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business 
any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance 

table of contents we and other providers of travel in the online travel industry are currently subject to various lawsuits related to hotel occupancy tax in numerous jurisdictions in the united states  and other jurisdictions may be considering similar lawsuits 
an adverse ruling in the existing hotel occupancy tax cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively  and possibly penalties  interest and or fees 
we have also been contacted by several municipalities or other taxing bodies concerning our possible obligation with respect to local hotel occupancy or related taxes  and certain municipalities have begun audit proceedings and some have issued assessments against us 
if we are found to be subject to the hotel occupancy tax ordinance by a taxing authority and we appeal the decision in court  certain jurisdictions may attempt to require us to provide financial security or pay the assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the tax assessment in court 
the proliferation of new hotel occupancy tax cases or audit proceedings could result in substantial additional defense costs 
these events could also adversely impact our business and financial performance 
see item  legal proceedings 
our businesses are highly regulated  and any failure to comply with applicable regulations or any changes in those regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate in a highly regulated industry both in the united states and internationally 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws  rules and regulations applicable to us  which could decrease demand for our products and services  increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities 
moreover  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
accordingly  these regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority 
our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another 
our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to our revenue generating and marketing activities  including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices 
our travel services are subject to regulation and laws governing the offer of travel products and services  including laws requiring us to register as a seller of travel in various jurisdictions and to comply with certain disclosure requirements 
as an otc that offers customers the ability to book air travel in the united states  we are also subject to regulation by the department of transportation  which has authority to enforce economic regulations and may assess civil penalties or challenge our operating authority 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and potential criminal violations 
any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our businesses and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in our services 
substantial or ongoing security breaches  whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based systems  could significantly harm our business 
we currently require customers to guarantee their transactions with their credit cards online 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential customer information  including credit card numbers 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data 
we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences 
however  our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our remediation plan to address these potential exposures 
a party whether internal  external  an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations 
security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security  which would have a negative effect on the demand for our products and services 
moreover  public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers willingness to use our websites 
a publicized breach of security  even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet  could inhibit the growth of the internet and  therefore  our services as a means of conducting commercial transactions 

table of contents our processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements  differing views of personal privacy rights or security breaches 
in the processing of customer transactions  we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information 
this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
this legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information  including credit card information  that is collected  processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 
we could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices  or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business 
travel companies have also been subjected to investigations  lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information 
as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues  we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 
these and other privacy concerns  including security breaches  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to attract  train and retain executives and other qualified employees is critical to our results of operations and future growth 
we depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our key executives  senior management and skilled personnel  particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and our information technology and systems 
any of these individuals may choose to terminate their employment with us at any time 
the specialized skills we require can be difficult and time consuming to acquire and  as a result  these skills are often in short supply 
a significant period of time and expense may be required to hire and train replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the company 
our inability to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by  for example  delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations or prospects for future growth
