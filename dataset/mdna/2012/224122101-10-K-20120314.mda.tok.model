pubs and other operations primarily include our five pubs  four of which are located adjacent to our beer related operations 
we proudly brew our widmer brothers  redhook and kona beers in each of our three company owned mainland production breweries that are located in portsmouth  new hampshire the new hampshire brewery  portland  oregon the oregon brewery  which is our largest brewery  and in the seattle suburb of woodinville  washington the washington brewery 
our brewery located in kailua kona  hawaii the hawaiian brewery brews our kona branded beers 
we also own and operate a small manual style brewery  primarily used for small batch production and innovative brews  at the rose quarter in portland  oregon 
we sell our beers primarily to wholesalers via a master distributor agreement a b distributor agreement with anheuser busch  llc a b 
redhook and widmer brothers beers are distributed in all states and kona beers are distributed in states 
separate from our a b wholesalers  we maintain an independent sales and marketing organization complete with resources across the key functions of brand management  field marketing  field sales  and national retail sales 
following is a summary of our financial results net sales net income number of barrels sold million million  million million  million million  the comparability of our results for relative to the results for and is significantly impacted by the merger with kona brewing co  inc kbc  which closed october  kbc merger  and by the sale of our equity interest in fulton street brewery  llc fsb during the second quarter of see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for more detailed information

table of contents shipments by brand the following table sets forth a comparison of shipments by brand in barrels year ended december  shipments shipments increase decrease change change in depletions widmer brothers redhook kona total year ended december  shipments shipments increase decrease change change in depletions widmer brothers redhook kona total total shipments by brand exclude private label shipments produced under our contract brewing arrangements 
the increase in total shipments in compared to was primarily driven by our increased sales and marketing efforts and new brand and package introductions  which began in the fourth quarter of the rate of change in depletions  or sales by the wholesalers to retailers  for the widmer brothers  redhook  and kona beers increased compared to the increase in sales dollars to a b and a b related in compared to was primarily due to an increase in volume  higher selling prices for our beers and a shift in product mix towards bottle and high end product  both of which carry a higher price per unit than draft 
gross sales were also favorably impacted by a decrease in the per barrel fee associated with sales to a b as a result of amendments to our a b distributor agreement  which is netted against revenue 
our savings from both the and amendments to the a b distributor agreement approximated for the amount of increase in sales realized for future periods may differ from these estimates due to the level  timing and geographic distribution of our shipments to a b 
exclusive of the impact of the favorable change in our per barrel margin fee  the average revenue per barrel on shipments of beer through the a b distribution network increased by in compared to and in compared to  primarily due to pricing increases and a shift in product mix towards both bottle and high end product as mentioned above 
price changes implemented by us have generally followed craft beer market pricing trends 
during  and  we sold  and  respectively  of our beer through a b at wholesale pricing levels 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our shipments by package  excluding private label shipments produced under our contract brewing arrangements in barrels year ended december  shipments of total shipments of total shipments of total draft bottle total the decrease in the widmer brothers brand shipments was primarily due to the continuing pressure on our hefeweizen beer in the very competitive wheat beer category in the craft segment 
this increased competition from large  multi national wheat beer competitors had a negative impact on hefeweizen sales 
partially offsetting this decrease was the success of our focus on the core and high end widmer brothers brands  which is fueling broader awareness of the overall widmer brothers brand 
we believe the growth in our redhook brand during was a result of our investments in new packaging  brand introductions  and marketing initiatives 

table of contents kona continues to be one of the fastest growing brands in the craft category  as seen in the increase in shipments in compared to and compared to this is based on the consumer s connection with the always aloha message and quality of the beer 
the increase in contract brewing sales in compared to was primarily due to an increase in shipments under an existing third party contract and the contribution of shipments under a new three year contract brewing arrangement with fsb  which was entered into in the first quarter of the increase in pubs and other sales in compared to was primarily due to the addition of pub operations acquired with the kbc merger 
the increase in contract brewing sales in compared to was due to a full year of shipments in compared to roughly one quarter of shipments in prior to the kbc merger  we earned revenue in connection with an alternating proprietorship agreement with kona  including fees for leasing the oregon brewery and sales of raw materials 
subsequent to the kbc merger  any such intercompany activities are eliminated  including the revenues associated with the alternating proprietorship agreement 
the increase in excise taxes in compared to was driven by three factors i increases in shipments  ii the addition of excise taxes relating to shipments of kona beers that were previously recognized by kona prior to the kbc merger  and iii a marginal tax rate increase after the kbc merger as the combined companies are eligible for only a single excise tax exemption 
increase in shipment volume was the most significant factor for the increase in excise taxes in compared to also contributing to the increases in both periods was an increase in the marginal tax rate for beer produced in washington state  which became effective in the second half of cost of sales cost of sales includes purchased raw materials  direct labor  overhead and shipping costs 
information regarding cost of sales was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs and other total beer related pubs and other total the decrease in beer related cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the elimination of costs associated with our kona operations prior to the kbc merger  including elimination of all alternating proprietorship related costs  and improved performance and quality trends in this was partially offset by the increase in shipments discussed above  including the mix shift from draft to bottle as the per barrel equivalent cost of bottle is more than draft  as well as increased shipping costs due to fuel surcharges 
the decrease in beer related cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to decreases in unit costs for certain core production inputs  raw materials  packaging materials and cooperage costs  partially offset by the increased shipments discussed above  as well as costs associated with a significant quantity of beer in that did not meet our exacting quality standards  causing us to dispose of in process and finished draft and packaged beer 

table of contents the increases in pubs and other cost of sales in compared to and in compared to were primarily associated with the acquired kona pub operations 
these operations had a positive impact on our gross profit as discussed below 
gross profit information regarding gross profit was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs and other total beer related pubs and other total gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin rate  was as follows year ended december  beer related pubs and other overall the increases in gross profit in compared to and in compared to were primarily due to the improvements in gross margin rate and the increases in sales discussed above  which included the reduction in a b fees 
the improvements in gross margin rate were primarily due to an improved cost structure related to our kona operations following the kbc merger  which included elimination of the alternating proprietorship revenue and cost of sales  improved brewery performance and quality trends  increased capacity utilization and a shift in mix to our higher end beer products 
these improvements were partially offset by the mix shift from draft to bottle sales as the barrel equivalent of bottle gross profit is lower than draft  as well as an increased cost of shipping as a result of fuel surcharges 
total approximate capacity utilization  which is calculated by dividing total shipments by the approximate working capacity  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
each year s total capacity is calculated using the product mix actually experienced in the specific year  which causes variances in total capacity from year to year  exclusive of changes to brewing equipment 
working capacity is the theoretical maximum output of all of our breweries and is based on running each of our facilities hours per day  seven days per week with full batches for each beer brewed 
working capacity does not take into account demand fluctuations due to seasonality  the perishability of beer  or product mix evolving in favor of higher end  lower volume brands 
considering these constraints  capacity utilization is unlikely to exceed approximately of working capacity in a given month period  unless we utilize external contract brewing resources during peak periods 
we entered into a three year contract brewing agreement for fsb during the first quarter of  which contributed to the improvements in capacity utilization in compared to 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  expenses incurred for our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company 
information regarding sg a was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change as a of net sales as a of net sales the increase in sg a and sg a as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs  principally comprised of labor costs related to our national sales organization  packaging design and development  promotions and sponsorship activity  point of sale and related trade merchandise  and brand platform enhancements 
administrative costs associated with the operations acquired with the kbc merger in october also contributed to the increases 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenditures reflect our investment in critical initiatives that have led to sales and profit growth 
we expect that the rate of increase in sg a spending going forward will not be as significant as seen during in conjunction with our acquisition of kona  sale of fsb  and rebranding efforts  we are aggressively targeting growth through national retail sales and eastern us expansion 
the increase in sg a and sg a as a percentage of net sales in compared to was due primarily to an increase in direct costs associated with sales and marketing activities  and costs associated with the kona operations following the acquisition in the fourth quarter of we incur costs for the promotion of our products through a variety of advertising programs with our wholesalers and downstream retailers 
these costs are included in sg a expenses 
local wholesalers often share in the cost of the program 
reimbursements from wholesalers for advertising and promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to sg a expenses 
pricing discounts to wholesalers are recorded as a reduction to sales 
the wholesalers contribution in the aggregate toward these activities was an immaterial percentage of net sales in  and depending on the industry and market conditions  we may adjust our advertising and promotional efforts in a wholesaler s market if a change occurs in a cost sharing arrangement 
the timing of these efforts may also be adjusted due to opportunities available to us over the course of the year 
merger related expenses merger related expenses of  in primarily included activities associated with the kbc merger  including legal  consulting  accounting and other professional fees  and severance costs 
merger related expenses of  in primarily included severance expenses associated with our merger with widmer brothers brewing company wbbc 

table of contents income from equity method investments income from equity method investments included our share of fsb s net income through the date of sale in may and our share of kona s net income through the date of the kbc merger in october since completion of the kbc merger  kona s operating results have been included in our consolidated operating results 
income from equity method investments was as follows in thousands year ended december  fsb kona total gain on sale of fsb our pre tax gain on the sale of fsb totaled million  which resulted from proceeds of million less the investment in fsb of million 
interest expense information regarding interest expense was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change year ended december  average debt outstanding average interest rate the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to the expiration of a non qualifying interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of and lower average outstanding borrowings 
the increase in the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was due to the reduction in the outstanding balance on lower interest rate debt during  partially offset by modifications we negotiated with our primary lender in the latter part of as a result of our improved financial condition 
the decrease in average outstanding borrowings was primarily the result of using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of fsb to repay the million outstanding on our line of credit 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to higher debt balances in to support our capital project and working capital requirements for we were able to pay down our outstanding borrowings during the lower average interest rate in compared to was primarily due to our improved financial results and an associated decrease in our funded debt  and modifications we negotiated with our primary lender in the latter part of income tax provision our effective income tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates reflect the impact of non deductible expenses  primarily meals and entertainment and state and local taxes 
the rate in also reflects non deductible merger related expenses and a  reduction to our valuation allowance during the second quarter of we made this reduction  eliminating the valuation allowance  due to the cumulative earnings generated and other evidence available to us regarding the potential of fully utilizing our outstanding net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents the income tax provision for also reflects the reversal of  of our million valuation allowance  based on our assessment that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized 
our assessment was primarily based upon the future reversal of existing temporary differences  primarily depreciation and amortization  and our operating results 
this favorable effect was partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses  a shift in the destination of our shipments  resulting in a greater apportionment of earnings and related deferred tax liabilities to states with higher statutory tax rates than in prior periods  and the then expected settlement with the internal revenue service irs regarding its examination of our income tax returns for and filed by wbbc and related adjustments to deferred tax accounts recorded in the wbbc merger 
liquidity and capital resources we have required capital primarily for the construction and development of our production breweries  to support our expansion and growth plans and to fund our working capital needs 
historically  we have financed our capital requirements through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and the sale of common and preferred stock 
we anticipate meeting our obligations for the twelve months beginning january  primarily from cash flows generated from operations 
in addition  we may borrow under our line of credit facility as the need arises 
capital resources available to us at december  included  of cash and million available under our line of credit facility 
with the receipt of million in cash related to the sale of our equity interest in fsb to a b and reimbursement of certain transaction fees  we repaid the million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we anticipate that the remaining million  which is being held in escrow  will be released to us in two equal payments on may  and november   subject to indemnification claims  if any 
we had  and  of cash at december  and  respectively 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  our debt as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and common shareholders equity was and at december  and  respectively 
a summary of our cash flow information was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities increase in cash cash provided by operating activities of million in resulted from our net income of million and net non cash expense of million  partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities as discussed in more detail below 
accounts receivable  net increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in our receivable from a b  which totaled million at december   as well as a  increase in our receivable from fsb  which totaled  at december  historically  we have not had collection problems related to our accounts receivable 
inventories increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to an increase in volume and demand 
accounts payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to a million decrease in our payable to fsb  which totaled  at december  this was partially offset by a  increase in the portion of our payable to a b that is included in accounts payable  which totaled million at december   and increased inventory purchases to support our increased level of sales 

table of contents as of december   we had the following net operating loss carryforwards nols available to offset payment of future income taxes federal nols of million  or million tax effected  and state nols of  tax effected 
we anticipate that we will utilize these remaining nols in the near future and  accordingly  once utilized  we will be required to satisfy our income tax obligations with cash 
capital expenditures of million in were primarily for the purchase or retrofitting of equipment to upgrade our breweries and the planning and design of a company wide supply chain management system 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily for investments in capacity and efficiency 
cash flows used in financing activities primarily consisted of net repayments on our line of credit and other long term debt obligations 
we have a loan agreement as amended  the loan agreement with bofa  which is presently comprised of a million revolving line of credit line of credit  including provisions for cash borrowings and up to million notional amount of letters of credit  and a million term loan term loan 
we may draw upon the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit and we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with the loan agreement

we pay that fixed rate less the benchmark rate  which  at december   was 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in  and 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based upon the selection and application of significant accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our estimates are based upon historical experience  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at various points in time 
actual results may differ  potentially significantly  from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased and existing operations 
reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in note segment results and concentrations in part ii  item of this form k 
we perform an annual impairment assessment as of december of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
qualitative factors considered in this assessment include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance 
we are not required to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment test and may instead bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value  we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step includes determining the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared with the carrying amount to determine if an impairment loss is recorded 
we use a combination of valuation methods  market capitalization and income approach  to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  estimated growth of the overall craft beer segment  and other factors 
if our estimated future cash flows were to significantly decline  an impairment charge could result 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
indefinite lived intangible assets we review indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily comprised of our trademarks  domain name and recipes  for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

table of contents the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by various factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate potential impairment of our long lived assets  including our distributor agreements  non compete agreements and other intangible assets  when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such long lived assets may be impaired 
in such cases  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future undiscounted cash flows and by preparing other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss during the current period 
we did not identify indicators of impairment during  or refundable deposits on kegs we distribute our draft beer in kegs that are owned by us  as well as in kegs that have been leased from third parties 
kegs that are owned by us are reflected as a component of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in our consolidated balance sheets at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the keg 
when draft beer is shipped to the wholesaler  regardless of whether the keg is owned or leased  we collect a refundable deposit  reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
upon return of the keg to us  the deposit is refunded to the wholesaler 
when a wholesaler cannot account for some of our kegs for which it is responsible  it pays us a fixed fee and forfeits its deposit for each keg determined to be lost 
we have experienced some loss of kegs and anticipate that some loss will occur in future periods due to the significant volume of kegs handled by each wholesaler and retailer  the similarities between kegs owned by most brewers  and the relatively low deposit collected on each keg when compared with the market value of the keg 
we believe that this is an industry wide problem and our loss experience is typical of the industry 
in order to estimate forfeited deposits attributable to lost kegs  we periodically use internal records  a b records  other third party records  and historical information to estimate the physical count of kegs held by wholesalers and a b 
these estimates affect the amount recorded as brewery equipment and refundable deposits as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the actual liability for refundable deposits could differ from estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales  net of excise taxes  discounts and certain fees we must pay in connection with sales to a member of the a b wholesale distributor network  when the products are delivered to the member 
a member of the a b wholesale distributor network may be a branch of a b or an independent wholesale distributor 
we recognize revenue on contract brewing sales when the product is shipped to our contract brewing customer 
we recognize revenue on retail sales at the time of sale and we recognize revenue from events at the time of the event 

table of contents deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
if we are unable to generate adequate taxable income in future periods or our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized is otherwise not accurate  we may incur charges in future periods to record a valuation allowance on our gross deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments included in cash and long term debt 
to mitigate this risk  we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement  which expires july   to hedge the variability of interest payments associated with our variable rate borrowings 
through this swap agreement  we pay interest at a fixed rate of and receive interest at a floating rate of the one month libor  which was at december  since the interest rate swap hedges the variability of interest payments on variable rate debt with similar terms  it qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
this interest rate swap reduces our overall interest rate risk 
we did not have any unhedged variable rate debt outstanding at december  due to the nature of our highly liquid cash  an increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash  nor the related interest income
