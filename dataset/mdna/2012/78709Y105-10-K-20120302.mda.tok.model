the company continues to pursue revenue and cost initiatives to improve profitability 
planned revenue initiatives include  but are not limited to  building density in our current geography  targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable segments  as well as pricing and yield management

management is committed to a market based wage program 
these actions reward the employees who have worked hard and sacrificed since the company s wage reduction in april the impact of this wage increase is expected to be approximately million annually 
if the company builds market share  there are numerous operating leverage cost benefits 
conversely  should the economy soften from present levels  the company plans to attempt to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage

the company sold the stock of jevic transportation  inc jevic on june  and remains a guarantor under indemnity agreements  primarily with certain insurance underwriters with respect to jevic s self insured retention sir obligation for workers compensation  bodily injury and property damage and general liability claims against jevic arising out of occurrences prior to the transaction date

critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to million per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis with respect to workers compensation claims  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pickup and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options  restricted stock and stock based awards
