item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment information included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f products division our products division  headquartered in tulsa  oklahoma  operates under the name braden manufacturing  llc braden 
our products division designs  engineers and manufactures gas turbine auxiliary equipment to the worldwide gas turbine power generation and cogeneration market segments 
our principal customers are gas turbine original equipment manufacturers oems and engineering  procurement and construction contractor epc firms 
we also provide replacement parts  filter elements and aftermarket retrofit equipment to both oems and end users 
our products are critical to the efficient operation of gas turbine power plants and are custom engineered to meet customer specific requirements 
gas turbine power generation  process and cogeneration market overview 
all gas turbine power plants combine a gas turbine with a generator to produce electricity 
in a simple cycle gas turbine plant  the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is vented to the atmosphere through an exhaust stack 
in a combined cycle plant  the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is fed into a heat recovery steam generator commonly referred to as an hrsg  the hrsg captures much of the heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam  which in turn is used to power a steam turbine and generate more electricity before the exhaust is vented into the atmosphere 
we manufacture products that are critical components of both simple cycle and combined cycle plants  including filter houses  inlet and exhaust systems and turbine and generator components 
we also engineer and manufacture specialized diverter dampers that are used in some combined cycle plants between the gas turbines and the hrsg 
we believe manufacturers of equipment and components supporting gas turbine power plants are well positioned to benefit from the need for new or more efficient power generation infrastructure 
the advantages of power generation plants utilizing gas turbine technologies versus other technologies include lower construction costs  shorter construction periods  
table of contents improved operating efficiency  lower emissions of co  minimal other environmental impact  flexibility to expand plant capacity  smaller geographical footprint  and rapid start up and shutdown time 
as a provider of equipment for simple and combined cycle gas turbine power plants  we expect to benefit from the forecasted growth of gas turbine power plant capacity related to the factors listed above 
gas turbine auxiliary equipment 
our technical engineering capabilities enable us to design and manufacture what we believe are among the broadest ranges of gas turbine power plant and other power related equipment to meet each customer s specific performance requirements 
we provide the following comprehensive range of products critical to the operation of gas turbine power plants filter houses 
a filter house cleans debris  dirt and other contaminants from the air that enters the turbine  using either a barrier filter or a pulse filter 
inlet systems 
inlet systems are large air intake ducts that connect the filter house to the gas turbine and provide silencing for the noise emanating from the gas turbine through the inlet 
exhaust systems 
exhaust systems direct the hot exhaust from the turbine to the atmosphere 
exhaust systems are custom engineered and complex due to the severe turbulence and heat exposure that they must endure 
diverter dampers 
diverter dampers divert the hot exhaust from the gas turbine into a heat recovery steam generator when the power plant is operated as a combined cycle facility or into the exhaust stack in the case of a simple cycle operation 
selective catalytic emission reduction systems 
selective catalytic emission reduction systems commonly referred to as scr are used in simple cycle gas turbine facilities and are focused on removing oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide from the exhaust gas 
packaged skids  precision parts and specialty fabrications 
packaged skids in various configurations support the operation of gas turbines 
precision parts and specialty fabrications are used in both new gas turbine equipment and in aftermarket applications 
the contracts under which we sell our products are generally fixed price contracts  most of which are lump sum bid contracts 
under lump sum bid contracts  we bid against other contractors based on relatively fixed customer specifications 
a significant portion of our products division project destinations are outside of the us supply chain structure 
we fabricate our equipment through a combination of in house manufacturing at our own facilities in the us and mexico and outsourced manufacturing in other countries around the world 
our network of high quality international manufacturing partners  located in more than countries  allows us to manufacture equipment worldwide and maintain a competitive cost structure 
outsourcing the majority of our manufacturing enables us to meet increasing demand without being restricted by internal manufacturing capacity limitations and also reduces our capital expenditure requirements 
our employees work closely with our international manufacturing partners to supervise the fabrication of our products at their facilities to ensure high levels of quality and workmanship 
our use of manufacturing facilities around the world  whether our own or those of our manufacturing partners  allows us to respond to the particular sourcing initiatives of our customers  whether those initiatives call for global sourcing or for localized supply content 
while we generally have proven long term relationships with our subcontractors  we also routinely search for additional fabricators to enhance our ability to manufacture equipment at the lowest cost while maintaining high quality standards and on time delivery 
we hold exclusivity agreements with key third party fabricators for oems 
we conduct regular quality audits of our fabricators and maintain staff onsite 
fabricators can take one to several years to qualify and meet international standards and it can take one to two years to bring a new fabricator online 
we work with our international manufacturing partners to maintain their oem certification and approved vendor status 
services division our services division  headquartered in atlanta  georgia  operates under various entities and trade names under williams industrial services group  llc williams 
we provide a comprehensive range of modification  maintenance and construction support services to a wide range of utilities and industrial customers  including nuclear  fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants and pulp and paper mills 
we provide these services in a general contracting capacity where we manage multiple subcontractors in some cases and in other cases we are retained as a subcontractor on the project 
williams primarily services us based nuclear power plants and performs tasks designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies 

table of contents industrial services industry and market overview 
the us industrial services industry is a multi billion dollar industry broadly defined as routine modification  maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants 
the industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints  reduce labor costs  increase labor utilization and productivity and eliminate operational redundancies 
we expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future aging infrastructure 
according to the us department of energy s energy information administration  more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the us was placed in service before coupled with the relatively limited number of large scale power generation facilities being constructed in the us  the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites have created opportunities for companies providing these services 
increasing demand for nuclear plant maintenance 
the us currently has operating nuclear reactors that generate approximately of annual electric production 
these nuclear reactors have been in operation for an average of more than years and require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance 
nuclear power plants in the us are subject to a rigorous program of us nuclear regulatory commission nrc oversight  inspection  preventive and corrective maintenance  equipment replacement and equipment testing 
nuclear power plants are required by the nrc to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage 
nrc regulations also require that nuclear generating facilities be decommissioned  or returned to greenfield status  at the end of their operating lives 
initially  commercial nuclear power plants in the us were licensed to operate for years  reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric utility companies for large capital investments 
in  the nrc issued the first license renewal to a nuclear power plant  extending its license for an additional years beyond its original year license allowing operations to continue for the long term 
at september  the nrc had extended the licenses of reactors  over two thirds of the domestic fleet 
the nrc is considering license renewal applications for further units as of october  with more applications expected by in all  about reactors are expected to operate for years  with owners undertaking increasing modification  maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade these facilities 
new nuclear reactor construction 
we expect new nuclear reactors to be constructed over the next years and beyond 
currently there are several new nuclear reactors in the early stages of construction or being re commissioned in the us our services division is involved in all four projects at varying levels 
we are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in us nuclear power plants under rules issued by the nrc 
under these rules  owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with nrc regulations on quality assurance  reporting of safety issues  security and control of personnel access and conduct 
the types of services we provide are frequently subcontracted by full scope new build contractors 
we maintain good relationships with both those firms that may be engaged to manage the full scope of the new operations as well as with the end customers who often specifically request that we provide certain aspects of a particular project based on their historical experience with us 
the services we provide our customers are designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies and extend the useful lives of process equipment in these facilities 
we provide these services both on a constant presence basis and for discrete projects 
our service offerings include the following nuclear power plant modification  maintenance and construction 
we perform a full range of critical services for the nuclear facility market  including capital project  facility upgrades  routine modification and maintenance work 
fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plant modification and construction 
we provide routine maintenance  repair and capital project services designed to extend plant life cycles 
other specialty services 
we provide the following specialty services to both our nuclear and industrial customers industrial painting and coatings 
we perform cleaning  surface preparation  coatings application  quality control and inspection testing  utilizing williams insight  our proprietary analysis system  to help our customers schedule and prioritize major coating projects

these services are commonly packaged with industrial coating projects 

table of contents asbestos and lead abatement 
we provide abatement services for the removal of asbestos and removal of heavy metal based coatings such as lead paint 
we do not take ownership of hazardous materials and do not assume responsibility for the liability associated with the materials other than for our actions meeting applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
roofing systems 
we routinely replace  repair and upgrade industrial facility roofing systems  primarily within the highly corrosive environments of pulp and paper manufacturing facilities 
our proprietary pro tec panel system allows our employees to safely work above operational equipment on roofing projects while completely containing all refuse materials 
valve services 
we provide integrated valve and actuator services that includes inspection  preventative maintenance and repair of various types of valves and actuators 
we offer a full spectrum of valve services for diagnostic testing and analysis  project management  training and engineering 
we provide these services throughout the us with experienced  temporary craft labor directed and supervised by an experienced team of project managers across our network 
our flexible staffing and equipment model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations  thus minimizing our fixed costs 
all of our services division revenue is from operations in the us we contract for approximately of the services we provide on a cost plus basis under contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit in the form of a mark up 
we contract for approximately of the services we provide on a fixed price basis 
we bid against other contractors based on customer specifications 
fixed price contracts present certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term  fixed price contracts may offer greater profit potential than other cost plus contracts 
subcontractor relationships 
we often serve as the primary contractor for our customers on projects 
for capital projects and facility upgrades  we manage multiple subcontractors including firms that provide nuclear engineering and design capabilities 
we believe that we maintain solid relationships with multiple engineering firms and believe that we can obtain these services from more than one firm 
customers  marketing and seasonality products 
our products customers include oems  epc firms  utilities and independent operators of power generation facilities and firms engaged across several process related industries 
the end users of most of our products are owners and operators of gas turbine power plants  process plants and refineries 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on gas turbine oems and epc firms engaged by end users of our products  including the developers and operators of gas turbine power plants 
we also market our products globally through a sales network consisting of employees and independent representatives in various countries including china  the netherlands  egypt  korea and the us our sales initiatives focus on highly engineered solutions  excellent performance on existing projects and on time deliveries that we believe differentiate us from our competitors 
services 
our services customers include major private and government owned utilities throughout the us as well as leaders in the us paper and industrial sectors 
we market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on site operations personnel 
we use our service track record with long term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement the existing contracts with small to medium sized capital projects 
our services sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within the targeted industries and customers throughout the us a portion of our business  primarily in our services division  is seasonal  resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year 
generally  spring and autumn are the peak periods for our services division as those are periods of low electricity demand during which our customers schedule planned outages 
our products division is less affected by seasons and is more impacted by the cyclicality of and fluctuations in the domestic and international economies that we serve 
engineering  design and maintenance capabilities products 
we believe the design and engineering expertise of our products division makes us an industry leader in the field of gas turbine auxiliary equipment 
we provide original design  retrofit and upgrade engineering and after sales maintenance and repair of our products

we employ a number of degreed engineers specializing in structural  electrical controls  mechanical  acoustical  industrial and other technical areas 
our engineers and designers use a pc based network and engineering and drafting programs such as autocad  ansys  staad  solidworks and several internally developed proprietary programs 

table of contents services 
we provide extensive training  certifications and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our project based employees 
for over years  we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry  benefitting both us and our customers 
we maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide 
we are one of a limited number of companies qualified to work anywhere in a us nuclear facility and have been one of the leading providers of coatings at us nuclear facilities for more than years 
materials and suppliers the majority of materials purchased are for the products division 
the principal materials for our products are carbon steel plate  stainless steel products and other structural shapes and insulation 
we obtain these products from a number of domestic and foreign suppliers 
the markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers and we believe that we can obtain each of the materials we require from more than one supplier 
competition products 
we compete with a large number of us and international companies along all of our major product lines 
we compete based on the price  quality  reliability and reputation of our products and our ability to engineer and design products to meet each customer s unique specifications 
our competitors  some of which are significantly larger than we are and have significantly greater financial resources than we do  vary with respect to each product category we offer 
we believe that no single competitor offers our breadth of products to the gas turbine power generation  process and cogeneration industries 
services 
the barriers to entry in nuclear industrial services where our services division is focused are generally high due to nrc qualifications and safety standards 
our competitors vary depending on plant geography and scope of services to be rendered 
several national vendors  which are significantly larger than we are and have significantly greater financial resources than we do  will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available 
additional smaller vendors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources 
we believe that the key competitive factors in industrial services are reputation  safety record  price  service  quality  breadth of service capabilities and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel 
we believe our project management capabilities including oversight of other nuclear subcontractors  service diversity  long term customer relationships and safety standards differentiate us from our competitors 
we also believe that the fact that we maintain a constant presence at many of our customers sites is a key competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities which allows us to better identify our customers service needs 
employees we had full and part time employees  excluding temporary services division craft labor  as of december  of these  were employed at our facility in mexico under a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on december  the number of employees in our services division can vary greatly  depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor 
much of our services division craft labor employees are contracted through various union agreements 
as of december   there were services division craft labor employees  of which were under collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relationships with our employees  both permanent and temporary  are satisfactory 
we are not aware of any circumstances that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of our facilities 
insurance and warranty we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury  damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship 
we may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available  or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects 
global power maintains performance and payment bonding lines sufficient to support the business and a credit facility that is adequate to provide any required letters of credit 
we require certain of our products division subcontractors to indemnify us and name braden manufacturing llc or other subsidiary as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors work 
we require our services division subcontractors to indemnify us and our customer and name williams industrial services group  llc or other subsidiary as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors work 
we also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies  including surety bonds in favor of us  to secure the subcontractors work or as required by contract 
there can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers 

table of contents intellectual property we use a variety of trademarks  proprietary technologies and other intellectual property in the ordinary course of business in both our products and services divisions 
we rely upon our pending and issued patents  registered and unregistered trademark rights  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  customers and others  and on various other security measures to protect our intellectual property 
our patents relating to certain exhaust systems will expire in  and a patent relating to a filter element clip will expire in other products are patent pending 
we do not believe that any single patent or proprietary technology is material to our business and we do not believe our competitive position would be materially affected by competitors also using similar technologies and systems 
compliance with government regulations we are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental  occupational health  nuclear regulatory  export and product safety laws applicable in the countries in which we operate 
we also purchase materials and equipment from third parties  and engage subcontractors  who are also subject to these laws and regulations 
environmental 
we are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions where we do business 
these laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release  spill  exposure or other accident involving such pollutants  substances or hazardous materials 
health and safety regulations 
we are subject to the requirements of the us occupational safety and health act and comparable state and foreign laws 
regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services  including electrical and repair and maintenance  to implement work practices  medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs in order to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials 
in recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work  these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations 
nuclear regulatory commission 
owners of nuclear power plants are licensed to build  operate and maintain those plants by the nrc 
their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with nrc regulations 
our services division must demonstrate to its customers that we will comply with nrc regulations related to quality assurance  reporting of safety issues  security and control of personnel access and conduct 
other regulatory matters 
to the extent we export technical services  data and products outside of the us  we are subject to us and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports 
these include and are not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries  which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the us department of the treasury 
a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions  including the imposition of fines  the denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from participation in us government contracts 
while we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental  occupational health  nuclear regulatory  export and product safety laws  there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business 
however  we believe that all our operations are in material compliance with those laws and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws

item a 
risk factors 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results 
risk factors related to our operations if the us were to change its support of nuclear power  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the us government has been supportive of increased investment in nuclear power as it represents approximately of the total power generating capacity in the us however  if the federal government changed its policy or if public acceptance of nuclear technology declines  demand for nuclear power could be negatively affected and potentially increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry 
the japan nuclear accident in march led to the establishment of the nrc s japan task force which concluded that there was no imminent risk from continued operation and licensing activities and made recommendations for safety and emergency preparedness 
the nrc is currently considering those recommendations 
we expect to see additional long term opportunities resulting from these recommendations  however  any reduced demand for nuclear power or increased regulation could adversely affect our customers  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

table of contents if our costs exceed the estimates we use to set the fixed prices of our contracts  our earnings will be reduced 
the majority of our gas turbine auxiliary equipment sales contracts and a portion of our nuclear and industrial services contracts are entered into on a fixed price basis 
these fixed price contracts have a limited ability to recover any cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on our projected costs  which are subject to a number of assumptions 
the costs that we incur in connection with each contract can vary  sometimes substantially  from our original projections 
because of the large scale and complexity of our contracts  unanticipated changes may occur  such as customer budget decisions  design changes  delays in receiving permits and cost increases  as well as delays in delivery of our products 
we often are contractually subject to liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated cost increases or delays may occur as a result of several factors  including increases in the cost of commodities primarily steel plate  labor or freight  unanticipated technical problems  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform  requiring modified execution plans or re work 
cost increases or overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers or our payment of liquidated damages under our contracts will lower our earnings 
increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our gross margins 
if we are unable to control the quality or timely production of products manufactured or services provided by our subcontractors  our reputation could be adversely affected and we could lose customers 
if we are unable to recover any advance progress payments made to subcontractors  our profitability would be adversely affected 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture and assemble a substantial portion of our products as well as provide some specialty services 
subcontractors account for a significant percentage of our manufacturing costs 
the quality and timing of production by our subcontractors is not totally under our control 
our subcontractors may not always meet the level of quality control and the delivery schedules required by our customers 
the failure of our subcontractors to produce quality products in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in the cancellation of orders for our products  significant warranty and repair costs and the loss of customers 
alternatively  we could be required to move subcontract manufacturing to other locations  resulting in increased costs 
in addition  we make advance progress payments to subcontractors in anticipation of their completion of our orders 
we may be unable to recover those advances if a subcontractor fails to complete an order  which may adversely affect our profitability 
our future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
our quarterly and annual revenue and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
our gas turbine auxiliary equipment sales contracts stipulate customer specific delivery terms that  coupled with other factors beyond our control  may result in uneven recognition of revenue and earnings over time 
customer imposed delays can significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
due to our relatively large average contract size  our gas turbine auxiliary equipment sales volume during any given period may be concentrated in relatively few orders  intensifying the magnitude of these fluctuations 
furthermore  some of our operating costs are fixed 
as a result  we may have limited ability to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated decreases in our revenue or the demand for our products in any given reporting period 
therefore  our operating results in any reporting period may not be indicative of our future performance 
because we must make significant estimates related to potential costs when we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis  these costs may change significantly from reporting period to reporting period based on new project information 
for example  if labor efficiency experienced on a project is lower than we estimated at the outset of the project  the costs incurred on the project will increase and the percentage of completion may be reduced from earlier estimates 
in addition  most of our gas turbine auxiliary equipment revenue is based on fixed price contracts  and the relative profitability can vary significantly between contracts 
as a result  our profitability can vary from reporting period to reporting period based on the specific contract mix 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our business outside the us because of numerous factors outside our control 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business outside the us including labor unrest  regional economic uncertainty  sovereign debt issues including the european debt crisis  political instability including unrest in the middle east  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country  currency exchange rate fluctuations  export duties and quotas  
table of contents expropriations  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  current and changing regulatory environments  potentially adverse tax consequences  availability of financing  unfavorable commercial terms and conditions  and potential for adverse dispute resolution outcomes 
these factors may impact our ability to meet product delivery commitments in foreign countries that could result in a decline in revenue or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business outside the us we conduct our manufacturing operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the us we have manufacturing facilities and subcontractors in many countries outside of the us including china  poland  romania  the middle east and mexico  and increasing our manufacturing footprint in low cost countries is an important element of our strategy 
there are a number of risks associated with doing business internationally  including a exposure to local economic and political conditions  b social unrest such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities  c currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  d export and import restrictions  and e the potential for shortages of trained labor 
in particular  there has been social unrest in the middle east and mexico and any increased violence in or around our manufacturing facilities could impact our business by disrupting our supply chain  and the delivery of products to customers 
in addition  the increased violence in or around our manufacturing facilities could present several risks to our employees who may be directly affected by the violence and may result in a decision by them to relocate from the area  or make it difficult for us or our subcontractors to recruit or retain talented employees 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us is unpredictable and vary from country to country 
any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our financial results 
a substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of equipment for gas turbine power plants 
during periods of declining construction of new gas turbine power plants  the market for our products is significantly diminished 
the demand for our products depends on the continued construction of gas turbine power generation plants 
the power generation equipment industry has experienced cyclical periods of slow growth or decline 
in periods of decreased demand for new gas turbine power plants  our customers may be more likely to decrease expenditures on the types of products and systems that we supply and  as a result  our future revenue may decrease 
these projects typically require funding from a healthy credit market as well 
as long as credit markets are tight  funding could be difficult to obtain therefore delaying or even cancelling these types of projects entirely 
a rise in the price or a shortage in the supply of natural gas could affect the profitability or operations of gas turbine power plants  which could adversely affect our future revenue 
these and other factors may temper demand for our products 
if in a particular geographic area prices of natural gas are so high or the supply of natural gas is so limited as to make the construction of new gas turbine power plants uneconomical in that geographic area  we may not derive any future revenue from projects in that geographic region unless and until those factors are reversed 
environmental laws and regulations have played a part in the increased use of gas turbine technology in various jurisdictions 
these laws and regulations may change or other jurisdictions may not adopt similar laws and regulations 
changes in existing laws and regulations could result in a reduction in the building and refurbishment of gas turbine power plants 
in addition  stricter environmental regulation could result in our customers seeking new ways of generating electricity that do not require the use of our products 
furthermore  although gas turbine power plants have lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity provided than coal fired power plants  emissions from gas turbine power plants remain a concern and attempts to reduce or regulate emissions could increase the cost of gas turbine power plants and result in our customers switching to alternative sources of power 
other current power technologies  improvements to these technologies and new alternative power technologies that compete or may compete in the future with gas turbine power plants could affect our sales and profitability 
any change in the power generation industry that results in a decline in the construction of new combined cycle and simple cycle power plants or a decline in the upgrading of existing simple cycle power plants to combined cycle power plants could materially adversely affect our sales 
a small number of major customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of any of these customers could negatively impact our business 
we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
in  three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the year 
in  three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the 
table of contents year 
in  four customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the year 
other than their obligations under firm orders placed in our backlog  none of our customers have a long term contractual obligation to purchase any material amounts of products or services from us 
all of our firm orders contain cancellation provisions  which permit us to recover only our costs and a portion of our anticipated profit if a customer cancels its order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we would not realize the full amount of future revenue included in our backlog 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 
because our major customers represent a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
several of our customers have the ability to internally source some of the products we manufacture 
any increase in this activity could reduce our sales 
our business volumes with each of our largest customers are highly dependent on power generation capacity additions for our products division and on operations and maintenance budgets for domestic utilities for our services division 
fluctuations in any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results 
the dollar amount of our backlog  as stated at any time  is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue 
when we receive a firm order for a project from a customer  it is added to our backlog 
however  customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control and we may be unable to replace any canceled orders with new orders 
to the extent projects are delayed  the timing of our revenue could be affected 
if a customer cancels an order  we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred 
typically  however  we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog contracts in the event of cancellation 
in addition  projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog 
because of these large orders  our backlog in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods 
our backlog  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue or of long term industry trends 
the success of our business is partially dependent upon maintaining our safety record 
our ability to obtain new business and retain our current business  particularly in our services division  is partially dependent on our continuing ability to maintain a safety record that exceeds the industry average 
if we fail to maintain superior safety performance  or if serious accidents occur in spite of our safety procedures  our revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our dependence on suppliers and subcontractors could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations 
we rely significantly on suppliers to obtain necessary materials and subcontractors to perform manufacturing and services 
although we are not dependent on any single supplier or subcontractor  any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers or subcontractors could negatively impact our operations 
the risk of a lack of available suppliers or subcontractors may be heightened as a result of recent market and economic conditions 
to the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  we could experience losses in the performance of our operations 
our former operating unit has been named as a defendant in asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
our former operating unit has been named as a defendant in a limited number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
neither we nor our predecessors ever mined  manufactured  produced or distributed asbestos fiber  the material that allegedly caused the injury underlying these actions 
the bankruptcy court s discharge order issued upon emergence from bankruptcy extinguished the claims made by all plaintiffs who had filed asbestos claims against us before that time 
we believe the bankruptcy court s discharge order should serve as a bar against any later claim filed against us  including any of our subsidiaries  based on alleged injury from asbestos at any time before emergence from bankruptcy 
in all of the asbestos cases finalized post bankruptcy  we have been successful in having such claims dismissed without liability 
findings of liability on our part in any of these cases that were filed against us after we emerged from bankruptcy that remain unresolved could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
efforts to increase our size through acquisitions will involve risks that could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
we intend to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities  some of which may be material to our business and financial performance 
we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons  including acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all  encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions  increased competition for targets  which may increase acquisition costs  consolidation in our industry reducing the number of acquisition targets  and 
table of contents competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions 
in addition  there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions  including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture  technological and product synergies  economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected  management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  we may experience problems in retaining customers  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is costly  and our ongoing operations may expose us to environmental liabilities 
our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or human health and safety 
we are subject to various us federal statutes and the regulations implementing them  as well as similar laws and regulations at the state and local levels and in other countries in which we operate 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations  we may be subject to significant liabilities for fines  penalties or damages  or lose or be denied significant operating permits 
for example  if employees of our services division accidentally release hazardous substances while working at a customer s facility  we may be subject to fines and costs of clean up as well as lawsuits by third parties 
in addition  some environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating releases of hazardous substances without regard to fault and on a joint and several basis  so that in some circumstances  we may be liable for costs attributable to hazardous substances released into the environment by others 
a defect in our products could result in unanticipated warranty costs or product liability not covered by our insurance  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we generally provide warranties for terms of three years or less on our products 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products 
warranty claims could result in significant unanticipated costs 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could also temporarily delay the sale of new products and adversely affect our reputation 
in addition  we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
the sale and servicing of complex  large scale equipment used in a variety of locations and climates  and integrating a variety of manufactured and purchased components entails an inherent risk of disputes and liabilities relating to the operation and performance of the equipment and the health and safety of the workers who operate and come into contact with the machinery 
because our products are used primarily in power plants  claims could arise in different contexts  including the following fires  explosions and power surges that can result in significant property damage or personal injury  and equipment failure that can result in personal injury or damage to other equipment in the power plant 
for example  a failure of a filter house provided by us could result in significant damage to costly precision components of the gas turbine generator that takes in conditioned air from the filter house 
this  in turn  could cause the owner of the gas turbine to seek to recover significant damages from us 
the insurance policies we maintain to cover claims of this nature are subject to deductibles and recovery limitations as well as limitations on contingencies covered  and we may  therefore  suffer losses from these claims for which no insurance recovery is available 
expiration of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could have adverse consequences on our services division 
we provide services to the nuclear industry through our services division 
the price anderson act promotes the nuclear industry by offering broad indemnification to commercial nuclear power plant operators and the department of energy doe for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the nrc and at doe nuclear facilities 
that indemnification protects not only the nrc licensee or doe prime contractor  but also others like us who may be doing work under contract or subcontract for a licensed power plant or under a doe prime contract 
to date  there has been no occasion for a determination of whether the price 
table of contents anderson act s indemnification provisions apply to all nuclear liabilities that might be incurred by a radioactive materials cleanup contractor 
the recently enacted energy policy act extended the price anderson act for an additional years 
a problem related to our provision of services at a nuclear facility could lead to a damage claim against us for which we might not be entitled to indemnification 
in addition  any well publicized problem with those services  whether actual or perceived  could adversely affect our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our revenue would be adversely affected if our patents and other intellectual property rights are unable to protect our proprietary products 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights to the technologies and know how used in our proprietary products and software programs 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of trade secret  unfair competition and similar laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot provide assurance that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
if we were required to commence legal actions to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others  we could incur substantial losses and or costs and divert management s attention from operations 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including engineers  skilled workers and key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified professional and or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring  subcontracting or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  is an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel 
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified  experienced mechanical  design  structural and software engineers  service technicians  marketing and sales personnel in our products and services divisions 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers  and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled  which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying  hiring and integrating new employees 
in addition  the failure to attract and retain key employees  including officers  could impair our ability to sustain or expand our operations  to provide services to our customers and conduct our business effectively 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic slowdowns and reductions in private industry and government spending 
in times of general economic contraction  our revenue  profits and our financial condition may be adversely affected and will not necessarily rise in tandem with general economic expansion 
the industries we serve historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general slowdowns in the domestic and international economies 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the demand for products and services from these industries 
orders for new electrical power generation capacity are placed by our customers with long lead times 
consequently  our bookings and revenue may rise or fall sharply as total industry orders tend to follow pronounced cycles of general expansion and contraction 
during a contraction phase  limited investment in new projects  deferrals of planned projects and project cancelations may significantly reduce our potential recognition of revenue and profits 
at the end of an expansion phase  the existence of excess capacity will negatively affect power prices which results in a reduction in new orders 
in addition to being cyclical in nature  our revenue does not correlate precisely with changes in actual or forecasted new capacity due to timing differences in revenue recognition 
during periods of declining demand for power  many of our customers may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending that may decrease the overall demand for our products and services 
our customers may find it more difficult to obtain project financing due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the global credit markets 
in addition  our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may still be affected by the recent economic slowdown 
if private industry and government spending are reduced  then our revenue  net income and overall financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 
we depend on our information technology systems for many aspects of our business 
our business may be adversely affected if our systems are disrupted by security breaches or if we are unable to improve  upgrade  integrate or expand our systems to meet our changing needs 
for example  we are in the process of converting to a new enterprise resource planning system in our products division and a failure to successfully implement such new system could adversely affect our business 
any damage  delay or loss of critical data associated with our systems may delay or prevent certain operations and may materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the supply and cost of materials we use in manufacturing our products fluctuates and could increase our operating costs 
steel is a significant portion of the raw materials used in our products 
local shortages of steel plate sometimes arise and it is possible that an adequate supply of steel will not continue to be available in all locations on terms acceptable to us 
the materials we use in our products are subject to price fluctuations that we cannot control 
changes in the cost of raw materials can have a significant effect on our gross margins 
rapid increases in material prices are difficult to pass through to customers 
if we are unable to pass on these higher costs  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
our participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations 
in addition to our defined contribution plan  we also contribute to over multiemployer pension plans throughout the us where we retain project based craft labor 
we believe that our responsibility for potential withdrawal liabilities associated with participating in multiemployer pension plans is limited because the building and construction trades exemption should apply to the substantial majority of our plan contributions 
however  pursuant to the pension protection act of and other applicable law  we are also exposed to other potential liabilities associated with plans that are underfunded 
as of december   we had been notified that certain pension plans were in critical funding status 
currently  certain plans are developing  or have developed  a rehabilitation plan that may call for a reduction in participant benefits or an increase in future employer contributions 
therefore  in the future  we could be responsible for potential surcharges  excise taxes and or additional contributions related to these plans which could impact our liquidity and results of operations 
additionally  market conditions and the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may result in a reorganization  insolvency or mass withdrawal that could materially affect the funded status of multiemployer plans and our potential withdrawal liability  if applicable 
we continue to actively monitor  assess and take steps to limit our potential exposure to any surcharges  excise taxes  additional contributions and or withdrawal liabilities 
however  we cannot  at this time  estimate the full amount  or even the range  of this potential exposure 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars or in the currencies of our expenditures 
however  we do enter into contracts that subject us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we may seek to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by limiting foreign currency contracts to those currencies where we have ongoing operating expenditures or entering into hedge contracts if there are limited ongoing expenditures in the same currencies 
however  these actions may not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
new legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays to our customers and our operations 
members of the u 
s congress and the us environmental protection agency epa are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing  a technology which involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production 
both the us congress and the epa are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing and soil or ground water contamination or any impact on public health or the environment 
legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in addition  some states have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing 
any new laws  regulation or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to delays in the construction of new gas turbine power plants and or increased operating costs for existing gas turbine power plants which could negatively impact demand for our products 
we are subject to anti bribery laws in the countries in which we operate 
failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities 
many of the countries in which we transact business have laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action 
we are subject to these laws in addition to being governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act restricting these types of activities 
in addition to prohibiting certain bribery related activity with foreign officials and other persons  these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations 

table of contents any failure by us  our subcontractors  agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties 
the failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we continue to assess the impact of various legislative proposals  including us federal and state proposals  and modifications to existing tax treaties  that could result in a material increase in our taxes 
we cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties  the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us  including increasing our tax burden  increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
work disruptions resulting from the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise could result in increased operating costs and affect our operating performance 
certain of our temporary services division craft employees are represented by labor unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with a lengthy strike or the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or other work stoppage at our mexico facility or at our customer locations  which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
risk factors related to our liquidity and capital resources volatility and uncertainty of the credit markets may negatively impact us 
we intend to finance our existing operations and initiatives with existing cash and cash equivalents  investments  cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our new million credit facility new credit facility entered into on february  if adverse national and international economic conditions continue or deteriorate further  it is possible that we may not be able to fully draw upon our new credit facility and we may not be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms 
in addition  deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect the ability of many of our customers to pay us on time and the ability of many of our suppliers to meet our needs on a competitive basis 
if we cannot access necessary additional funds on acceptable terms  our business and operations may be negatively impacted 
our inability to obtain adequate surety bonding or letters of credit could reduce our ability to bid on new work  which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers and may be required to provide letters of credit 
these bonds and letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us  we may not be able to pursue that project 
in addition  bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost as a result of general conditions that affect the insurance and bonding markets 
surety bonds and letters of credit may cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the limitations and covenants contained in our new credit facility could constrain our ability to borrow additional money  sell assets and make acquisitions 
compliance with these restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to fully implement elements of our business strategy 
our new credit facility contains a number of limitations and covenants that could limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to borrow money or make capital expenditures  incur liens  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  merge or sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  and make acquisitions 
in addition  our new credit facility contains other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios  including total leverage and interest coverage 

table of contents if we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial covenants currently in effect under our new credit facility or obtain additional amendments or waivers from our lenders  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures and business acquisitions  restructure or refinance our indebtedness  decline certain business opportunities from customers or seek additional capital 
if we were required to write down our goodwill or other indefinite lived long term assets  our results of operations and stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected 
we have approximately million of goodwill and indefinite lived long term assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we are required to review goodwill and indefinite lived long term assets for impairment at least annually in accordance generally accepted accounting principles in the us if our results of operations decline  an impairment may be triggered 
if we were required to write down our goodwill or long lived assets  our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates and from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
portions of our operations are located in foreign jurisdictions and a portion of our billings is paid in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could therefore cause fluctuations in those revenues derived from foreign operations 
for example  a decrease in the value against the us dollar of the foreign currency we receive for a project as to which a significant portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars would adversely affect our revenue  as expressed in us dollars  and our net income from that project 
in addition  sales of products and services are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
changes in foreign currency rates can also affect the costs of our products purchased or manufactured outside the us changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro  the potential re introduction of individual currencies within the eurozone  or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financing 
as a result of the debt crisis with respect to countries in europe  in particular most recently in greece  italy  ireland  portugal and spain  the european commission created the european financial stability facility the efsf and the european financial stability mechanism the efsm to provide funding to countries using the euro as their currency the eurozone that are in financial difficulty and seek such support 
in march  the european council agreed on the need for eurozone countries to establish a permanent financial stability mechanism  the european stability mechanism  which will be activated by mutual agreement  to assume the role of the efsf and the efsm in providing external financial assistance to eurozone countries after june despite these measures  concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations  the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 
these concerns could lead to the re introduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries  or  in more extreme circumstances  the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely 
should the euro dissolve entirely  the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time 
these potential developments  or market perceptions concerning these and related issues  could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and obligations 
in addition  concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally  and more specifically on the ability of our customers  suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses  to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs  if at all  on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 
risk factors related to our common stock our common stock  which is listed on the nasdaq stock market  may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid

table of contents overview we are a comprehensive provider of gas turbine auxiliary equipment and maintenance services for customers in the domestic and international energy  power infrastructure and service industries 
we operate through two business segments  which we refer to as our products division and our services division 
through our products division  we design  engineer and manufacture a comprehensive range of gas turbine auxiliary equipment primarily used to enhance the efficiency and facilitate the operation of gas turbine power plants as well as for other industrial  energy and power related applications 
through our services division  we provide on site specialty  maintenance and outage management services for commercial nuclear reactors and specialty maintenance and other industrial services to fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants and other industrial operations in the us these services include a comprehensive range of industrial modification  maintenance  construction and specialty services 
sale of deltak assets on august   we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our deltak business unit  which was part of our products division  to hamon corporation  a subsidiary of hamon compagnie international sa  for million in cash  less a million working capital adjustment 
given that deltak s products were primarily for industrial and process applications  the divestiture allows us to focus on our power generation end markets 
we have reclassified the historical results of operations of our deltak business unit to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
unless noted otherwise  the discussion and analysis that follows relates to our continuing operations only 
industry trends and outlook products division 
demand for our product lines has historically fluctuated with industrial demand for new power generating capacity 
our products are sold globally and there is generally about six to months from when the order is booked until it is shipped 
the demand for our products is based on worldwide economic growth and long term views regarding natural gas as an energy source 
with stabilizing gross domestic product gdp forecasts worldwide  the correlated impact of gdp growth on power consumption and an increased focus on shale gas development in north america and other markets  we believe that demand for gas fired power generation plants is likely to strengthen over time due to their relatively quick construction times  low capital costs and low carbon emissions as compared to other forms of fossil fueled power plants 
while renewable energy sources could reduce future gas fired power additions  we believe gas fired power generation is likely to continue to be the preferred choice for stand by capacity to complement intermittent forms of renewable energy 
we also believe that renewable energy sources have a higher cost when compared to traditional forms of power generation 
economic recovery has typically been accompanied by a rise in commodity prices 
we expect the demand for power generating capacity additions in the developing international markets will out pace growth in north america over the near term 
in regions where natural gas is plentiful  we expect that gas fired power generation is likely to be the preferred fuel source for baseload power 
various international regions are making capital investments in natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure 
these investments could contribute to more stabilized natural gas pricing which is generally favorable to the gas fired power generation market as a whole 
international markets are more volatile to changes in the global economy and the worldwide financial crisis that began in late resulted in decreased demand and capital expenditures in the power industry with product volumes stabilizing in uncertainty surrounding climate change legislation has further delayed many projects 
the worldwide financial crisis starting in late resulted in reduced funding and project delays for gas turbine projects in and our lower gross margins earned in are partially attributable to competitive pricing pressures resulting from orders placed in in  we began to see recovery in certain markets  led by the middle east  as new orders increased across all of our product lines 
in other regions and europe in particular  demand for our products has had limited recovery from the global economic recession 
recently  we have seen an increase in the number of requests for quotes and an increase in booking activity throughout  which we believe further signals a recovering market for the products we manufacture 
given the increase in our backlog in the second half of  we are cautiously optimistic regarding near term prospects for new orders given the positive economic indicators across all product offerings in most markets outside of europe 
however  continued political and social unrest in the middle east could result in supply disruptions  order delays or both  which could adversely affect our financial results 
within europe  we expect demand for new power projects to remain low principally as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis 
while we believe that our contract terms  procurement procedures and global customer base make it less likely that a change in foreign currency rates could have a significant impact on operating results  there remains significant uncertainty regarding the euro in should the european economic or sovereign debt crisis result in heightened volatility  our results of operations could be affected 
we expect gross margins in to be relatively consistent with our gross margins earned in 
table of contents services division 
demand for plant upgrades  modification and maintenance services in the us has been positively impacted by the aging infrastructure of nuclear power generation facilities and the increasing tendency of plant owners electing to outsource these services as a means of reducing fixed costs 
our level of plant modification and maintenance work performed during refueling outages at nuclear power plants has remained stable  with period to period fluctuations resulting from the timing of particular outages within our customer base 
within our modification and maintenance services  our customers have not seen a significant recovery from the economic recession 
in response to lower demand and a mild winter  some of our customers have deferred maintenance projects reducing bid opportunities 
within our customer base  there is one less scheduled refueling outage in as compared to consolidation in the industry and the trend of multi plant customers consolidating their vendor base has also reduced the number of project bid opportunities available to us while making the impact of those bids more significant 
further  our customer base is increasing its reliance on full scope epc firms to manage longer term capital projects 
in addition to our traditional modification and maintenance services  we are seeking to align with complementary service providers to provide turn key epc services for larger capital and maintenance projects 
we see this alignment as an area of continued future growth that would allow us to reach new customers and markets and would provide cyclical offsets to the timing of refueling outages in our traditional modification and maintenance business 
we also expanded our service offerings with other complementary offerings including valve maintenance and repair services and unique coating applications that enhance the value of the coatings to allow customers to obtain a longer coating life 
while we provide most of our specialty services as an addendum to our traditional modification and maintenance services at power plants  we also service customers in other segments of the market including pulp and paper and conventional power 
as a result of economic conditions in those segments  the growth opportunities for our specialty services are focused on niche service offerings  typically within our existing customer base 
prospects for construction of new nuclear power plants or upgrading previously idled plants in the us are gaining momentum for the first time in more than years 
we also see growth opportunities in specialty services and project management work 
as more of these projects enter the construction phase  much of the nuclear management talent is likely to be absorbed and we will likely benefit from customers seeking to outsource to subcontractors to meet new build project demands 
we anticipate making investments in organic growth initiatives that are expected to position us for additional nuclear work as well as expand our end markets  primarily through workforce additions 
we expect these investments will increase our operating costs slightly in  but will provide resources that will develop opportunities for long term growth 
we also expect to see additional long term capital project opportunities resulting from the nrc s japan task force recommendations  however  the extent and timing of such opportunities is yet to be determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included under page f of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we are organized in two major segments the products division and the services division 
substantially all of our revenues within the products division are derived from fixed priced contracts 
within the services division  we enter into a variety of contract structures including cost plus reimbursements  time and material contracts and fixed price contracts 
the determination of the contract structure within services division is based on the scope of work  complexity and project length and customer preference 
we expense pre contract costs as incurred 
change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when they can be reliably estimated and it is probable that the adjustment will be approved by the customer or realized 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
revenue for gas turbine auxiliary equipment is recognized as units are substantially completed  which is typically when the unit is delivered 
revenues for the scr product line in the products division and the fixed price contracts in the services division are recognized on the percentage of completion method 

table of contents the percentage of completion method generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract since management has the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs 
we use the level of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract 
if the most likely profit margin cannot be precisely determined  the lowest probable level of profit in the range of estimates is used until the results can be estimated more precisely 
our estimate of the total hours or total contract costs to be incurred at any particular time has a significant impact on the revenue recognized for the respective period 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  final contract settlements and resolution of claims may result in revisions to costs and income  and the effects of such revisions are recognized in the period that the revisions are determined 
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which they first become apparent 
under percentage of completion accounting  management must also make key judgments in areas such as the percentage of completion  estimates of project revenue  costs and margin  estimates of total and remaining project hours and liquidated damages assessments 
any deviations from estimates could have a significant positive or negative impact on our results of operations 
products division revenue for gas turbine auxiliary equipment is recognized as the contract is substantially completed  which is typically when the unit is shipped 
certain of these contracts specify separate delivery dates and milestones of individual equipment units 
in these circumstances  we recognize as revenue when the customer assumes the risk of loss and title for the equipment  which is generally the date the unit is shipped  and costs previously deferred are charged to expense 
our scr product line follows percentage of completion method based on cost to cost input measures 
regardless of contract provisions  we require that the customer assumes risk of loss and title  and the installation is operating according to specifications or is an uninstalled unit that has been accepted by the customer for revenue to be recognized 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  final contract settlements and resolution of claims may result in revisions to job costs and income amounts that are different than amounts originally estimated 
cost plus and time and material contracts represent the majority of the contracts in the service division 
for these contract types  we recognize revenue when services are performed based upon an agreed upon price for the completed services or based upon the hours incurred and agreed upon hourly rates 
some of our contracts include provisions that adjust contract revenues for safety  schedule or other performance measures 
on cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes applicable mark up earned through the date services are provided 
fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method using cost to cost measures 
occasionally  we may exclude certain costs from the cost to cost method such as significant costs for materials or subcontractors if the exclusion of such costs would result in a more meaningful measurement of actual progress towards completion of the contract 
revenue and cost of revenue for the discontinued deltak business unit in the products division were recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of actual hours incurred to date in relation to total estimated hours for each contract 
this method was used because management considered expended labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
long lived assets 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subsequent measurement impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we group long lived assets by legal entity for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss as this is the lowest level for which cash flows are independent 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable according to asc impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if circumstances require a long lived asset be tested for possible impairment  we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we have determined that no events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amount of any of these long lived assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on the testing of goodwill impairment giving entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before having to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit  however  we did not choose the qualitative assessment only option 
consequently  we executed a quantitative based impairment test as of december  during  and  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill and concluded that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded 
we also assess goodwill at the end of a quarter if a triggering event occurs 
in determining whether an interim triggering event has occurred  management monitors i the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test and ii significant changes to future expectations 
in connection with the sale of the deltak business unit in  we reduced the products division goodwill by million on august  and performed an assessment as of the transaction date of the reporting unit affected and concluded that the estimated fair value of the affected reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded 

table of contents we estimate a portion of the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach by utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on several factors including balance sheet carrying values  historical results  our most recent forecasts  and other relevant quantitative and qualitative information 
we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital at the date of evaluation 
we also use the market approach to estimate the remaining portion of our reporting unit valuation 
this technique utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate 
while the income approach has the advantage of utilizing more company specific information  the market approach has the advantage of capturing market based transaction pricing 
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  and general market conditions 
significant changes in these forecasts  the discount rate selected  or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the combined estimated fair value of all of our reporting units from the weighted total of the market approach and income approach often results in a premium over our market capitalization  commonly referred to as a control premium 
the calculated control premium percentage is evaluated and compared to an estimated acceptable midpoint percentage 
in the event that the calculated control premium is above this midpoint  a portion of the excess control premium is allocated to reduce the fair value of each reporting unit in order to further assess whether any reporting units have incurred goodwill impairment 
assessing the acceptable control premium percentage requires judgment and is impacted by external factors such as observed control premiums from comparable transactions derived from the prices paid on recent publicly disclosed acquisitions in our industry 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize in income the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date 
under asc income taxes asc  fasb requires companies to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  and utilizing a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous operating history are given more weight than its future outlook  although we do consider future taxable income projections  ongoing tax planning strategies and the limitation on the use of carryforward losses in determining valuation allowance needs 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the second quarter of  we significantly reduced our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for intangible assets  accruals and us net operating loss nol carryforwards in accordance with asc management s assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including  among other evidence  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  recent utilization of nol carryforwards  historical operating income  projected future taxable income  customer concentration  tight credit markets  and tax planning strategies 
based on results of the assessment  we determined that it was more likely than not that the us nol carryforwards are realizable based on the guidance provided in asc because the us nol carryforwards are expected to be realized due to current year and future year s income  only the portion attributable to future year s income was released as a discrete event during the second quarter of the remainder was allocated to subsequent interim periods as current year activity as income was realized and would have adjusted the estimated annual effective tax rate 
we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit in the second quarter of for continuing operations of million related to the release of valuation allowances as of june  current year income allowed interim period decreases to the valuation allowance of million and million for third quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively 
additionally  there were partially offsetting increases to valuation allowances in the second and fourth quarters of of million and million  respectively  for state nol modifications 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards were realizable and released the valuation allowance recorded against the portion of foreign tax credit carryforwards deemed realizable 
accordingly  we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit at december  of million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance in regards to foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we continue to record valuation allowances against a portion of foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state nol carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that taxable income of the appropriate character will not be recognized in the appropriate jurisdictions before the carryforwards expire 
as of december   we have valuation allowances of million and million recorded against foreign tax credit carryforwards and state nol carryforwards  respectively 

table of contents during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we believe that our benefits and accruals recognized are appropriate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretation of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is determined to be different than the amounts recorded  those differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in note income taxes included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f warranty costs 
we estimate warranty costs based on past warranty claims  specific identification method  sales history and applicable contract terms 
our warranty terms vary by contract but generally extend for no more than three years after delivery or completion of services 
we manage our exposure to warranty claims by having our field service and quality assurance personnel regularly monitor projects and maintain ongoing and regular communications with our customers 
insurance 
we self insure a portion of our risk for health benefits and workers compensation 
we maintain insurance coverage for other business risks including general liability insurance 
we retain exposure to potential losses based on deductibles  coverage limits  and self insured retentions 
we charged approximately million  million and million to expense during the years ended december   and  respectively  with respect to health benefits and workers compensation claims incurred and related insurance premiums for excess claim coverage for continuing operations 
our reserves as of december  and consisted of estimated amounts unpaid for reported and unreported claims incurred 
our accrual for all self insured risk retention as of december  was million 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding as security for possible workers compensation claims 
recent accounting guidance 
for a discussion of recent accounting guidance and the expected impact that the guidance could have on our consolidated financial statements  see note summary of significant accounting policies included in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents year results selected financial and operating data for our reportable business segments for the most recent three years is summarized below 
this information  as well as the selected financial data provided in item and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k  should be referred to when reading our discussion and analysis of results of operations below 
our summary financial results during the years ended  and are as follows in thousands years ended december  products revenue services revenue total revenue cost of products revenue cost of services revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling and administrative expenses reorganization expense income operating income interest expense  net other income income from continuing operations before income tax income tax benefit expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on disposal  net of tax income from discontinued operations net income products operating results for our products division during reflected higher volumes compared to the prior year as a result of increased demand primarily in the middle east and asia 
we saw increases in most of our product lines  most notably in our filter house product line 
gross profit during was higher than  primarily attributable to the increase in volumes 
gross margins in were lower than gross margins due primarily to a change in contract mix 
total net bookings of million reflect increases commensurate with the increased volumes 
services volumes in our services division depend in significant part upon our customers scheduling of refueling outages and timing of capital project work  which historically has varied from year to year and within each calendar year 
as a result  the volume of outage work in any calendar year may vary as compared to prior years and during the course of the year as projects are commenced and completed 
during  we experienced a lower level of capital project work compared to as we completed a significant portion of the required services on a particular capital project booked in mid gross profit in was lower than due primarily to the decline in revenue and non recurring favorable reserve adjustments in backlog our backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers 
backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments 
the time between receipt of an order and actual completion  or delivery  of our products varies from a few weeks  in the case of inventoried precision parts  to a year or more  in the case of custom designed gas turbine auxiliary equipment and other major plant components 
we add a booking to our backlog for products division orders when we receive a purchase order or other written contractual commitment from a customer 
the maintenance services we 
table of contents provide through our services division are typically carried out under long term contracts spanning several years 
upon signing a multi year maintenance contract with a customer for services  we add to our backlog only the first twelve months of work that we expect to perform under the contract 
additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work 
capital project awards are typically defined in terms of scope and pricing at the time of contractual commitment from the customer 
upon receipt of a customer commitment  capital project bookings are added to our backlog at full contract value regardless of the time frame anticipated to complete the project 
backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts 
backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled  modified or otherwise altered by our customers 
the following table shows our backlog  by segment  as of december   and in thousands backlog as of december  products backlog services backlog total our products division backlog as of december  increased from december  by million 
this increase reflects the overall improvement of global market conditions 
while the recent growth in backlog was largely driven by the us and middle east  we are seeing backlog growth across most product lines and geographic areas 
the ratio of orders booked to orders shipped was to during the year ended december  our services division backlog as of december  declined from december  by million 
the decline from december  was largely attributable to the completion of a large capital project during the first quarter of  which was partially offset by additional maintenance bookings and new orders with existing customers

table of contents services revenue 
the composition of our services division revenue varies from period to period based on contract mix lump sum versus fixed price and capital versus maintenance and the number and scope of outages for our nuclear maintenance contracts

selling and administrative expenses increased by million during compared to  primarily attributable to an increase in non cash stock compensation  which was million in as compared to million in also impacting the comparative increase were the relocation of corporate headquarters from tulsa  ok to irving  tx  higher costs for personnel  system upgrades within our products division  and merger and acquisition costs 
the comparative increase was partially offset by non recurring costs in related to our efforts to become a public company including costs associated with the preparation of our registration statement on form reorganization expense income in thousands variance reorganization expense income reorganization expenses historically consisted of professional fees and changes in liabilities subject to compromise incurred in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings 
during  we incurred an immaterial amount of reorganizational expenses as the bankruptcy activity wound down 
during  our estimated liabilities subject to compromise significantly decreased in large part due to a july u

as a result of the settlement and our related compromise of our own claim against the fund that had been established pursuant to our plan of reorganization  we received a cash payment of million during the settlement received more than offset professional fees incurred during interest expense  net in thousands variance interest expense  net interest expense consists of term loan interest  interest on outstanding letters of credit  interest on our unused commitment and amortization of debt issuance costs offset by interest income earned on cash balances 
interest expense decreased million during as compared to the decline was attributable to repayment of the term loan facility in november  resulting in a million reduction in interest expense and a million reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs 
since november  there have been no subsequent borrowings 
other income in thousands variance other income other income consists mainly of a gain on foreign exchange contracts recognized in income tax benefit expense in thousands variance income tax benefit expense the decrease in income tax expense from to the income tax benefit in was primarily related to our second and fourth quarter assessments of our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for intangible assets  accruals  foreign tax credits and us nol carryforwards in accordance with asc management s assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including  among other evidence  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  recent utilization of nol carryforwards  historical operating income  projected future taxable income  customer concentration  tight credit markets  and tax planning strategies 
based on results of the assessment  we determined that it was more likely than not that the us nol carryforwards are realizable based on the guidance provided in asc because the us nol carryforwards are expected to be realized due to current year and future year s income  only the portion attributable to future year s income was released as a discrete event during the second quarter of the remainder was properly allocated to subsequent interim periods as current year activity as income was realized and would have adjusted the estimated annual effective tax rate accordingly 
therefore  we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit in the second quarter of for continuing operations of million related to the release of valuation allowances  which significantly impacted the income tax expense during current year income allowed interim period decreases to the valuation allowance of million and million for third quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively 
additionally  there were partially offsetting increases to valuation allowances in the second and fourth quarters of of million and million  respectively  for state nol modifications 
additionally  we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit in the fourth quarter of of million for the partial release of valuation allowances on some of the foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we did not reverse valuation allowances against remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state nol carryforwards 
our effective tax rate was a negative during  compared to during the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a fluctuation in the valuation allowance we used in connection with deferred tax assets 
other contributing factors included permanent differences between book and tax treatment of certain items  and mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions 
reductions to the valuation allowance reduced our effective tax rate by approximately during and during permanent differences between book and tax treatment of certain items increased our effective tax rate by approximately during and during

the geographic dispersion of where products were shipped during the years ended and was as follows in thousands variance united states canada europe mexico asia middle east other total the million  or  decrease in products division revenue during compared to resulted  in part  from the reduction of demand experienced in for power and the availability of financing  which negatively impacted shipments of gas fired turbines by oems 
additionally  the first half of revenue represented a higher volume of shipments for projects booked prior to the recession in late and contributed to more material year over year variances despite a well balanced product mix 
quarterly volumes beginning in the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of were relatively flat 
geographic declines were most significant in the middle east and europe where the reduction in demand was most prevalent and revenue was below levels by million and million  respectively

no comparable gain was recognized during liquidity and capital resources overview as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet  including million on deposit outside the us cash generated by operations and borrowings available under the new credit facility are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
we believe our cash flow from operations and our available borrowings will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
our primary uses of cash are working capital  general corporate purposes  capital expenditures and interest payments on our unused borrowing capacity 
additionally  we may use cash on hand to support growth initiatives either organically or through acquisitions 
the primary elements of our working capital accounts are accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  other assets  accounts payable  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and other accrued liabilities 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable and manage the operating cash flows of global power by managing the working capital accounts in total  rather than by the individual elements 
this comprehensive view of working capital  taking into account each of the six primary elements listed  is both common and useful in our project based industry  as it facilitates reviews of cash flow information at the total working capital level 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings in addition to our new credit facility will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing above our new credit facility will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available under terms acceptable to us 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially hinder our future expansion strategies 
liquidity outlook aside from normal recurring operational and financing cash flows  expectation of sources and uses of cash and our liquidity for includes we expect to utilize a combination of nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in as such  we do not expect to pay us federal income taxes in we do not expect the loss of cash flows from the sale of the deltak business unit in to have a material effect on our capital resources and liquidity in we expect to spend between million to million in upgrades to facilities  equipment and information technology infrastructure 
we could have acquisitions during  which we may elect to  or may be required to  borrow under our new credit facility

financing credit facilities 
our previous million credit facility previous credit facility consisted of a million revolving letter of credit facility  including a million cash advance sub facility and a million term loan facility 
on november   we repaid the outstanding balance of the term loan and all related interest in full 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding and we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the previous credit facility 
on february   we entered into the new credit facility  which replaced the previous credit facility 
the new credit facility allows for borrowings up to million  with an accordion feature for up to million of additional borrowing capacity 
the facility has a million revolving letter of credit facility and provides access to multi currency funds 
the new credit facility has a maturity date of february  the new credit facility  while structured to support strategic growth initiatives and provide flexibility regarding return on capital alternatives  includes affirmative and negative covenants  including customary limitations on securing additional debt and liens and restrictions on transactions and payments as well as the following two financial covenants 
table of contents our maximum consolidated leverage ratio cannot exceed specified limits 
for these purposes  our consolidated leverage ratio on any date is the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to our consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters 
we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense  net of interest income  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
our consolidated interest coverage ratio must be maintained at least at specified minimum levels 
for these purposes  our consolidated interest coverage ratio is the ratio of a our consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters to b our consolidated interest expense consisting of all global power interest for that period 
we will be in default under the new credit facility if we fail to comply with any of these financial covenants  fail to comply with certain other customary affirmative or negative covenants  fail to make payments when due  experience a change of control  or become subject to insolvency proceedings 
for these purposes  a change of control will occur if any one person or group obtains control of more than ownership  unless they were an investor on february  in which case the ownership percentage would need to be more than for a change of control to occur  or if continuing directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the members of our board of directors 
if we default  the participating banks may restrict our ability to borrow additional funds under the new credit facility  may require that we immediately repay all outstanding loans with interest and may require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
we have given a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets as security for the new credit facility 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
debt or equity financing may not  however  be available to us at that time due to a variety of events  including  among others  credit rating agency downgrades of our debt  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is currently not dependent on the use of off balance sheet transactions but  in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers and may be required to provide letters of credit 
if performance assurances are extended to customers  generally our maximum potential exposure is limited in the contract with our customers 
we frequently obtain similar performance assurances from third party vendors and subcontractors for work performed in the ordinary course of contract execution 
however  the total costs of a project could exceed our original cost estimates  and we could experience reduced gross profit or possibly a loss for a given project 
in some cases  if we fail to meet certain performance standards  we may be subject to contractual liquidated damages 
as of december   we had a contingent liability for issued and outstanding stand by letters of credit  generally issued to secure performance on customer contracts 
the balance of stand by letters of credit totaled approximately million for the domestic entities and million us dollars for foreign entities as of december  currently  there are no amounts drawn upon these letters of credit 
in addition  as of december   we had outstanding surety bonds on projects of approximately million 
our subsidiaries provide financial guarantees for certain contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business 
as of december   the balance of these financial guarantees was no greater than million 

table of contents contractual obligations our cash requirements as of december  for contractual obligations were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations relate to real property 
the table above does not include potential payments relating to our commitment fees for unused lines of credit as management believes that our interest expense on the unused line will not have a material impact on our cash flows and financial position  or uncertain tax positions of million as of december   as we cannot reasonably predict the timing of the net cash outflows associated with the settlement of these obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we have established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
foreign exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have from time to time used derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency transactions 
we did not enter into any such instruments as of or during the year ended december  we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is volatility of interest rates  primarily in the us we manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
we are subject to interest rate changes on our libor based variable interest rate under our new credit facility 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings on any credit facility and have not borrowed funds since the november payoff of the term loan on our previous credit facility 
interest rate sensitivity 
based on the absence of any term loan borrowings as of december   a basis point fluctuation in short term interest rates would have a de minimis impact on our expected pre tax income on an annual basis
