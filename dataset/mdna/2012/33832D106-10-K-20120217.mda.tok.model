item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of the last decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the united states population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many snfs to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new snfs by most states and assisted living facilities in some states  has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities 
we believe that many snfs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 

table of contents beginning in  problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that led to a recession in the united states 
the recession resulted in aggressive government spending in the united states  significant business layoffs  reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets  and lower real estate prices 
during the past three years  weak economic conditions throughout the country have negatively affected our occupancy 
these conditions have impacted many companies both within and outside of our industry and it is unclear when current economic conditions  especially the housing market  may materially and sustainably improve 
although many of the services we provide are needs driven  some of those needs may be deferred during recessions  for example  relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed 
also  we have experienced some pricing pressures from competition 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in snfs 
we believe that our experience in providing high quality rehabilitation services at our irfs has assisted us to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit was implemented in pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or mma  and by december  approximately of medicare beneficiaries had prescription drug coverage  mostly through medicare part d  according to hhs 
because the mma has increased medicare expenditures for prescription drugs  the federal government has sought to implement various cost control measures and as a result  the profitability of providing pharmacy goods and services has been reduced 
we anticipate that this trend will continue 
because the profits available from individual pharmacy transactions have been  and likely will continue to be reduced  we believe our institutional pharmacy business will need to expand to maintain or improve its financial results 
operations we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other senior living operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
rent expense we lease senior living communities excluding one senior living community classified as discontinued operations and two rehabilitation hospitals from snh and four senior living communities from hcp 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 

table of contents institutional pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities  hospitals and pharmacies 
costs incurred on behalf of managed communities includes wages and benefits for staff and other operating expenses related to the communities that we manage for the account of snh or for the account of the current owner  pending snh s acquisition of the communities 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own  and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business 
in the senior living community segment we operate for our own account  manage for the account of snh or for another owner  pending snh s acquisition  independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs that are subject to centralized oversight and provide housing and services generally to elderly residents 
our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient rehabilitation services to patients at two hospital locations and at three satellite locations and outpatient rehabilitation services at affiliated outpatient clinics 
we do not consider our institutional pharmacy operations to be a material  separately reportable segment of our business 
consequently  we report our institutional pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states  except for the operations of our captive insurance company  which participates in our workers compensation  professional liability and automobile insurance programs and operates in the cayman islands 
see our consolidated financial statements included in exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report on form k for further financial information on our operating segments 
we use segment operating profit as a means to evaluate our performance and for our business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit excludes interest  dividend and other income  interest and other expense  and corporate income and expenses

discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and are primarily due to losses we incurred at assisted living communities  snfs and pharmacies that we have sold or expect to sell 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and million available to borrow on our million credit agreement 
we believe that a combination of our existing cash  cash equivalents  net cash from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate cash flow to fund our debt obligations and run our business  invest in and maintain our properties and fund future acquisition commitments for the next months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
if  however  our occupancies continue to decline and we are unable to generate positive cash flow for an extended period  we expect that we would explore alternatives to fund our operations 
such alternatives may include further reducing our costs  incurring debt under  and perhaps in addition to  our credit agreement  engaging in sale leaseback transactions of our owned communities and issuing new equity or debt securities 
in addition  we may from time to time consider raising additional capital or obtaining additional financing to explore business opportunities  such as acquisitions 
as of december   we have a working capital deficit of million  which includes million due under the bridge loan  which matures on july  we expect to be able to repay the bridge loan prior to its maturity  however  our ability to do so is largely dependent on market conditions  which are 
table of contents beyond our control 
the bridge loan agreement provides that if the bridge loan is not repaid on or before its maturity date  snh may satisfy the bridge loan by acquiring certain of the communities securing repayment of the bridge loan and leasing them to us 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but this registration statement does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
auction rate and available for sale securities until june   we held investments in trading securities which consisted of ars that were primarily bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the federal family education loan program 
pursuant to their terms  the ars were subject to periodic auctions  which impacted their liquidity and terms 
due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these ars failed starting in the first quarter of in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs related to our investment in ars and on june   we exercised our right  or the ubs put right  pursuant to this agreement to require ubs to acquire our remaining ars at par value 
ubs settled and paid to us million on july   which was net of our outstanding balance on our ubs secured revolving credit facility of million 
prior to exercising the ubs put right  we measured the fair value of our ars by reference to a valuation statement provided by ubs that was calculated with the assistance of a valuation model 
this model considered  among other items  the collateral underlying the investments  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows including possible refinancing of the securities and a determination of the appropriate discount rate 
the analysis also included a comparison  when possible  to observable market data of securities with characteristics similar to our ars 
we reviewed the components of  and calculations made under  ubs s model 
prior to exercising the ubs put right  we valued the ubs put right by taking into consideration the fair value of our ars  the amounts outstanding on our loan with ubs and a factor representing our credit party risk with ubs 
the largest risk associated with the ubs put right was the continued financial solvency of ubs 
the value of the ubs put right typically fluctuated inversely with the value of the ars that we held 
we recorded the ubs put right at fair value since we expected that the changes in fair value of the ubs put right would be largely offset by the changes in the fair value in the ars 
we routinely evaluate our available for sale investments to determine if they have been impaired 
if the book or carrying value of an investment is less than its estimated fair value and we expect that situation to continue for a more than a temporary period  we will record an other than temporary impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income 
we estimate the fair value of our available for sale investments by reviewing each security s current market price  the ratings of the security  the financial condition of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment during temporary market price fluctuations or until maturity 
in evaluating the factors described above  we presume a decline in value to be an other than temporary impairment if the quoted market price of the security is below the security s cost basis for an extended period 
however  this presumption may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating the value decline is temporary in nature  such as when the operating performance of the obligor is strong or if the market price of the security is historically volatile 
additionally  there may be instances in which impairment losses are recognized even if the decline in value does not fall within the criteria described above  such as if we plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis 
when we believe that a change in fair value of an available for sale security is temporary  we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains and losses 
when we determine that an impairment in the fair value of an available for sale security is an other than temporary impairment  we record a charge to earnings 
we did not record an impairment charge for the year ended december  we recorded a charge of million for an other than temporary impairment in the value of our securities held by our captive insurance company for the year ended december  due to several bankruptcies and government actions involving the companies that issued the securities we held 

table of contents assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the proceeds from our sale of common shares in the public offering and net cash flow generated from our operations

in february  snh acquired a senior living community with units located in alabama and we entered into a long term management contract with snh to manage this community on terms substantially consistent with those that we have previously entered into with snh for communities that include assisted living units 
upon our request  snh may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from snh and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas  however  snh is not obligated to purchase these improvements from us and we are not obligated to sell them to snh 
during the year ended december   snh reimbursed us million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from snh and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by approximately million 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics and our pharmacies are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
during the past three years  weak economic conditions throughout the country have negatively affected our occupancy 
these conditions have impacted many companies both within and outside of our industry and it is unclear when current economic conditions  especially the housing market  may materially improve 
although many of the services we provide are needs driven  some of those needs may be deferred during recessions  for example  relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed 
at some of our senior living communities principally our snfs and at our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics  medicare and medicaid programs provide operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our snfs and our two rehabilitation hospitals 
we derived of our consolidated revenues from these programs for each of the years ended december   and our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents and at our rehabilitation hospitals totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cms has recently adopted rules that took effect on october  that it estimates will reduce aggregate medicare payment rates for snfs by approximately in federal fiscal year actions of congress or cms may change these estimates 
we expect the reduction to our medicare snf rates in federal fiscal year to be material and adverse to our future financial results of operations 
some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced  or are expected to freeze or reduce  medicaid rates 
also  certain temporary increases in federal payments to states for medicaid programs ended as of june  we expect the ending of these temporary federal payments  combined with the anticipated slow recovery of state revenues  to result in continued difficult state fiscal conditions 
some state budget deficits likely will increase  and certain states may reduce medicaid payments to healthcare services providers like us as 
table of contents part of an effort to balance their budgets 
we cannot currently estimate the type and magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our expenses  but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
similarly  we are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance reforms  payment reforms  and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to ppaca 
expanded insurance availability may provide more paying customers for the services we provide 
however  if the changes to be implemented under ppaca result in reduced payments for our services  or the failure of medicare  medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our costs  our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected 
medicare and medicaid programs provided approximately  and of our revenues from our rehabilitation hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
effective october   cms adopted an update of approximately in aggregate medicare payment rates for irfs in federal fiscal year  including a rebased annual increase of approximately to account for inflation  reduced by a productivity adjustment of  both pursuant to ppaca  and increased by in estimated outlier payments 
as a result of changes in applicable wage indexes and lip percentages contained in the rule  we estimate that the increase in our hospitals medicare payment rates may be approximately 
cms has issued the rule establishing revised medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals must meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program 
as amended  the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility s inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of the cms s designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
we believe our rehabilitation hospitals are operating in compliance with the cms requirements to remain irfs 
however  the actual percentage of patients at our irfs who meet these medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or anticipate or may decline 
our failure to remain in compliance  or a cms finding of noncompliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our irfs 
insurance increases over time in the costs of insurance  especially professional liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts 
these increased costs may continue in the future 
we  rmr and other companies to which rmr provides management services own an insurance company  which has designed and reinsured in part a property insurance program under which we and the other owners participate

in june  snf sold the remaining of these seven snfs  which was located in georgia  for net proceeds of approximately million and our annual rent payable to snh decreased by approximately  per year 
in  we decided to sell two snfs we own that are located in michigan with an aggregate of living units 
in september  we recorded a million asset impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these two snfs to their estimated fair value based upon expected sales prices less costs to sell 
while we continue to market these properties  we can provide no assurance that a sale of these snfs will be completed 
in august  we agreed with snh that snh should sell one assisted living community located in pennsylvania with living units  which we lease from snh 
we and snh are in the process of selling this assisted living community and if sold  our annual minimum rent payable to snh will decrease by of the net proceeds of the sale to snh  in accordance with the terms of our lease with snh

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessments of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  reserves related to our self insurance programs and our valuations of our goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payers or other obligors  the residents or payers stated intent to pay  the residents or payers financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
determining reserves for the casualty  liability  workers compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
since these reserves are based on estimates  the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved 
we regularly adjust these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors  our actual claims experience  recommendations from our professional consultants  changes in market conditions and other factors  it is possible that such adjustments may be material 
we review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances exist  for impairment 
if our review indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  and our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments 
all of our goodwill is located in our senior living reporting unit 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the senior living reporting unit  as determined by discounted cash flows and market approaches such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples  with its carrying value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include expected future revenue growth  gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
the key assumption in the market approach is the selection of guideline companies and the determination of earnings multiples 
if the 
table of contents carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds our estimate of its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
our estimates of discounted cash flows as reflected in our baseline forecast may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions that adversely affect occupancy rates  reductions in government or third party reimbursement rates  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance affecting our gross margins 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review  we believe that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  as of our evaluation date  the fair value of the senior living reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 
as of december   our carrying amount of goodwill was million 
the key variables that affect the cash flows of our senior living reporting unit are estimated revenue growth rates  estimated operating expenses excluding interest and taxes  estimated capital expenditures  growth rate assumptions and the weighted average cost of our capital 
we select the revenue growth rate based on our view of the growth prospects of the senior living reporting unit considering expected occupancy rates and private pay and government and third party reimbursement rates 
estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures consider our historical and expected future operating experience 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to increase a reporting unit s revenue and improve its profitability 
for the senior living reporting unit  relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows or small changes in other key assumptions may result in a goodwill impairment charges 
future events that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the senior living reporting unit include  but are not limited to decreases in revenues due to decreases in the occupancy rates and our daily rates  decreases in revenues and profitability at our senior living communities due to the inability of residents who pay for our services with their private resources to afford our services  future medicare and medicaid rate reductions and other changes from the ppaca which impact our daily rates  decreases in the reporting unit s gross margins and profitability due to increased labor or other costs  or our inability to successfully stabilize an acquired community s operations  increases in the weighted average cost of our capital including the market risk component  and changes in the structure of our business as a result of changes in relationships with our related parties 
changes in one or more of these factors could result in an impairment charge 
we review the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected undiscounted cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate 
this process requires that estimates be made and if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly this could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as a result of our evaluation  we reduced the value of our long lived assets by million reported on our balance sheet as of december  related to several of our senior living communities 
some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals 
any misjudgments or incorrect estimates affecting our critical accounting policy could have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an accounting standards update requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the update clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the update also requires reporting entities to disclose additional information regarding fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  in june  fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring additional disclosure regarding comprehensive income 
the update requires reporting entities to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements 
the update also requires reporting entities to present the components of other comprehensive income in their interim and annual financial statements 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  in july  fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring healthcare entities to change the presentation of their statements of operations by reclassifying any provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue 
the update also requires enhanced disclosure about policies for recognizing revenue and assessing bad debts 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of these updates did not  and is not expected to  cause any material changes to the disclosures in or the presentation of  our consolidated financial statements 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to realize rate increases paid by medicare and medicaid programs may be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations 
accordingly  we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe 
table of contents that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
impact of climate change the current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our communities to increase 
in the longer term  we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients  residents and other customers in higher charges for our services 
however  in the short term  these increased costs  if material in amount  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates has not materially changed from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by of current interest rates and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the aggregate market value of our million aggregate principal amount of outstanding mortgage debt and million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes on december  would decline by approximately million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by of current interest rates and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the aggregate market value of our million aggregate principal amount of outstanding mortgage debt and million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes on december  would increase by approximately million 
our credit agreement bears interest at floating rates and matures on march  as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreement 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at libor with a floor of per annum plus basis points 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our credit agreement but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit agreement and interest rates above the floor or minimum rate decreased or increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would decrease or increase by  or per share  based on our outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
the bridge loan bears interest at floating rates and matures on july  as of december   million aggregate principal amount was outstanding under the bridge loan 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under the bridge loan bear interest at a rate equal to the annual rates of interest applicable to snh s borrowings under its revolving credit facility  plus 
as of december   the interest rate was under the bridge loan 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of the bridge loan but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our bridge loan remains outstanding and interest rates decreased or increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would decrease or 
table of contents increase by  or per share  based on our currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
