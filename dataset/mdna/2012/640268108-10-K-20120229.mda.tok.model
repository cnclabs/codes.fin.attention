item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview strategic direction of our business we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms  which are designed to improve the benefits of drugs for patients 
our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology  pain  anti infectives  anti viral and immunology 
our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs  peptides and other potential biologic drug candidates 
we create our innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of drugs to create new molecular entities 
polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers 
additionally  we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise 
our drug candidates are designed to improve the pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  half life  bioavailability  metabolism or distribution of drugs and improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for the patient 
our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets 
our most advanced proprietary product candidate  nktr  is a peripheral opioid antagonist that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of opioid induced constipation 
we are a party to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with astrazeneca for the global development and commercialization of nktr and nktr nktr is an early stage research and development program that is designed to combine various opioids with nktr on march   astrazeneca announced enrollment of the first patient in phase clinical studies for nktr that astrazeneca calls the kodiac study 
this phase clinical program is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of nktr as a medicine to relieve opioid induced constipation  a common side effect of prescription opioids when used for chronic pain management 
the outcome of the kodiac study will have a substantial impact on our financial condition as we are entitled to million in regulatory filing and commercial launch milestones 
if the kodiac study is successful and astrazeneca files for regulatory approval with the fda and the european medicines agency ema  nektar will be entitled to million of these milestones 
we will be entitled to the remaining million of these milestones if nktr is approved by the fda and ema and commercial launch is achieved in the us and one major country in the european union eu 
following the commercial launch of nktr  we are entitled to significant and escalating double digit royalties varying by country of sale and based on the level of annual net sales 
therefore  the results from the kodiac study  the timing and outcome of approval review of nktr by the fda and ema  the timing of the commercial launch of nktr if approved  and the level of nktr sales  will have a significant impact on our financial condition and future business prospects 
our second most advanced drug candidate  nktr  is a next generation topoisomerase i inhibitor  currently being evaluated as a single agent therapy in a phase open label  randomized  multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
this phase clinical study  which we call the beacon study breast cancer outcomes with nktr  was initiated by us in december the beacon study is scheduled to enroll approximately patients with metastatic breast cancer 
the beacon study will require a substantial investment over the next three years 
in the first quarter of  we are also completing an expanded phase clinical study for nktr in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
the original phase 
table of contents clinical study was completed in mid and we further expanded this study to enroll up to additional women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer who had progressed after prior treatment with doxil doxorubicin hcl liposome injection 
in november  we announced that enrollment in this expanded phase study was slower than anticipated because of a shortage of doxil related to serious manufacturing issues being experienced by the manufacturer and supplier of doxil 
as of february  approximately of the planned patients had been enrolled in the study 
we are currently in the process of compiling and performing verification procedures on certain top line results ie objective tumor response rate from the patients enrolled to date 
results from this study and communication with government health authorities in both the united states and eu  will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for nktr in ovarian cancer 
we also have a significant collaboration with bayer healthcare llc bayer for amikacin inhale  an inhaled solution of amikacin  an aminoglycoside antibiotic  that has completed phase development 
preparations for a phase clinical study  which we currently expect to start in the second half of  are continuing 
the program is significantly behind schedule due to our plan with bayer to finalize the design of the nebulizer device for commercial manufacturing prior to initiating phase clinical development  with the objective of commencing phase clinical trials as soon as possible following completion of this work 
we expect to continue to make significant investments over the next two years in establishing manufacturing capability for the nebulizer device necessary to support the phase clinical study of this drug candidate and  if such study is successful and the drug candidate is approved by government health authorities  the commercial supply of the nebulizer device 
while the late stage clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company  we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier stage drug candidate pipeline 
for example  we plan to advance nktr into phase clinical trials in and we also plan to file an investigational new drug application ind for nktr in while we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results and or receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets  drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results is extremely difficult to predict 
clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition  and market value 
historically  we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary pegylation reagents on a cost plus or fixed price basis 
our current strategy is to manufacture and supply pegylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit 
as a result  whenever possible  we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component 
for example  in october  we entered into a supply  dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with amgen  inc and amgen manufacturing  limited  which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with amgen in in addition  in december  we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with merck through its acquisition of schering plough corporation to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed 

table of contents key developments and trends in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities and million in indebtedness 
we have million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes due september we have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital 
we expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including nktr  nktr  nktr  and nktr will continue to require significant investments in order to advance through the clinic with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through cash from licensing  collaboration and manufacturing agreements and public and private placements of debt and equity securities 
while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions  we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near future 
as discussed above  the success of the kodiac study is critical to providing cash to fund our operations and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this study 
on february   we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on cimzia and mircera in exchange for million 
additionally  we incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
while the net proceeds from this transaction will fund more than of the september repayment obligation for the outstanding convertible notes  we intend to pursue other financing alternatives before the convertible note maturity date which could include the sale of additional royalty interests from legacy agreements or term loan arrangements 
where we believe it is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders  we are pursuing financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders 
however  if non dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we could be required to pursue dilutive equity based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock 
if we are not successful in raising additional funds through financing activities in  we may be required to reduce our research and development spending in one or more programs  as well as general and administrative expenses  in order to conserve working capital until additional funding becomes available either from our existing collaborations  new collaboration partnerships or additional fundraising activities 
our substantial debt  the market price of our common stock  and the general economic and equity market climate  among other factors  could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and could affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing alternatives

product sales royalty revenues license  collaboration and other total revenue 
table of contents our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements  under which we may receive product sales revenue  royalties  license fees  milestone payments or contract research payments 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
upfront fees received for license and collaborative agreements are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement 
as a result  there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue 
management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations 
given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations  significant judgment is required by management to determine the performance periods 
product sales product sales include cost plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners 
product sales decreased during the years ended december  and compared to the prior periods primarily as a result of decreased product demand from our collaboration partners due in part to the transfer of manufacturing activities to certain collaboration partners 
the timing of shipments is based on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year 
we expect product sales to increase in compared with royalty revenues we receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products 
royalty revenues increased during the years ended december  and compared to the prior periods primarily as a result of the increase in royalties received from roche s mircera and ucb pharma s cimzia product sales 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized million  million  and million  respectively  in aggregate royalties from net sales of mircera and cimzia 
as noted above  in february  we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on cimzia and mircera 
however  although any future cimzia and mircera royalties will go directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests  as this transaction will be recorded as a liability that amortizes over the life of the estimated royalty payment period  we will continue to recognize the royalties as revenue  which we expect to increase in license  collaboration and other revenue license  collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses 
the level of license  collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments  the achievement of milestones  the continuation of existing collaborations  the amount of reimbursed research and development work  and entering into new collaboration agreements  if any 
license  collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the complete recognition as of december  of the million upfront payment received in the fourth quarter of from astrazeneca in connection with the nktr and nktr global license agreement 
this decrease was partially offset by the recognition of a million license fee  million in milestones earned under existing collaboration agreements  and increases in revenue recognized in from upfront payments received by us during we expect license  collaboration and other revenue in to be consistent with 
table of contents for the year ended december   the increase in license  collaboration and other revenue compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to recognition of the upfront payment received from astrazeneca for nktr and nktr in the fourth quarter of  contract research and other revenue from astrazeneca  and the recognition of the license extension option payment received from roche in december under the astrazeneca license agreement and related technology transfer agreement  we recognized million and million of the million upfront payment and million and million of contract research and other revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized million and million  respectively  of the million license extension option payment from roche for the years ended december  and  respectively

cost of goods sold product gross profit product gross margin the decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the million decrease in product sales in and an increase in overall commercial and proprietary manufacturing activity in compared to that resulted in decreased costs per unit 
the increase in product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the different mix of products sold and the decreased costs per unit in resulting from increased manufacturing activity 

table of contents the decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the million decrease in product sales and the inclusion in cost of goods sold in of a million success fee that became due to one of our former consulting firms in the increase to product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the million success fee included in cost of goods sold in as a result of the fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities  we expect product gross margin to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level of manufacturing orders from our customers

research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation  clinical study costs  direct costs of outside research  materials  supplies  licenses and fees 
research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a million increase in direct research and development program costs and related materials costs  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased headcount to support our expanded clinical efforts  and a million increase in support and facilities related costs  which includes increased non cash depreciation and non cash rent expenses related to our new facility in the mission bay area of san francisco  california mission bay facility 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased headcount to support our expanded clinical development efforts and further investment in and development of proprietary drug candidates in our research and development pipeline 
the increase also includes a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense due to our higher stock price and increased headcount  a million increase to facilities and equipment costs primarily due to the completion of our india research facility and to the move to our mission bay facility  and a million increase in supplies  including clinical trial materials 
these expense increases were partially offset by a million decrease in outside services  including contract research organizations  due primarily to lower expenses for the nktr and nktr programs as a result of our successful completion of phase clinical studies and collaboration with astrazeneca pursuant to the license agreement entered into in september

in addition  during the year ended december   we made million of prepayments to certain vendors in our beacon study partnered with bayer healthcare llc in august as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale  we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate 
partnered with astrazeneca in in general  all development costs incurred by us after partnering with astrazeneca are reimbursed by astrazeneca 
we expect research and development expense to substantially increase over the next several years 
we plan to continue to advance nktr in the beacon study metastatic breast cancer and in phase clinical studies in ovarian and colorectal cancers 
our expanded phase clinical study in platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer patients is expected to continue throughout based on our compilation and review of preliminary interim results in the expanded phase study in ovarian cancer and our communications with government health authorities  we will decide the future of our clinical development efforts in this indication 
at the same time  we continue to advance the phase clinical study for nktr in colorectal cancer patients 
we will be funding all of the clinical development costs for nktr without reimbursement from a collaboration partner for the foreseeable future 
the clinical development costs for nktr will be significant 
although we are still in the early stages of the beacon study  we estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the beacon study will range from approximately million to million  of which million was paid as of december   and that it will be completed around the end of we are unable to estimate the dates or costs to complete the clinical development efforts for the ovarian and colorectal cancer indications in which we are studying nktr 
table of contents in addition to our nktr development activities  in  we plan to initiate a phase clinical study for nktr that we expect to complete in we also plan to invest in an initial phase clinical study for nktr that we expect to complete in in addition  we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale up for the nebulizer devices to supply bayer for the amikacin inhale program 
under our collaboration agreement with bayer  we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for amikacin inhale 
we do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with nktr and nktr as astrazeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates 
in addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during and beyond  we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business 
our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes  including small molecules and large proteins  peptides and antibodies  across multiple therapeutic areas 
we plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development  the drug candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete 
the cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to the number of patients required to fully enroll a clinical study  the length of time required to enroll clinical study participants  the number and location of sites included in the clinical studies  the clinical studies designs required by the health authorities ie primary and secondary end points  the potential for changing standards of care for the target patient population  the competition for patient recruitment from competitive drug candidates being studied in the same clinical setting  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  approvals from government health authorities 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for nktr  nktr and amikacin inhale 
in these situations  the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 

table of contents the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
other than for the beacon study  due to the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales  royalties and research and development contracts  as well as public and private placements of debt and equity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and indebtedness of million  including million of convertible subordinated notes  million in capital lease obligations and million in other liabilities 
additionally at december   we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors  including our landlord  totaling million 
these letters of credit will expire during and are secured by investments of similar amounts 
we have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital 

table of contents on february   we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on cimzia and mircera in exchange for million 
additionally  we incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
while the net payments from this transaction will fund more than of the september repayment obligation for the outstanding convertible notes  we intend to pursue other financing alternatives before the convertible note maturity date which could include the sale of additional royalty interests or term loan arrangements 
we may also seek from time to time to purchase or retire our outstanding convertible notes through cash purchases and or exchanges for other of our securities in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions and or a tender offer  if we can do so on attractive terms 
we will evaluate financing alternatives  if any  in light of the then existing market conditions 
where we believe it is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders  we are pursuing financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders 
however  if non dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we could be required to pursue dilutive equity based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock 
in addition  we expect the phase clinical trials of nktr to require particularly significant resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate 
if we are not successful in raising additional funds through financing activities in  we may be required to reduce our research and development spending in one or more programs  as well as general and administrative expenses  in order to conserve working capital until additional funding becomes available either from our existing collaborations or additional fundraising activities 
our substantial debt  the market price of our common stock  and the general economic and equity market climate  among other factors  could substantially weaken our financial condition and could reduce or eliminate our ability to obtain short term and long term financing alternatives 
please refer to part i  item a  risk factors  we may need to raise substantial additional capital to repay the million in convertible notes due in september and fund our future operations  and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions and we have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan 
if we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements  execute new high value collaboration partnerships  or if we are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions  we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development 
due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than two years 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
at december   the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately ten months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed twenty four months 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million  which includes million for semi annual interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes  million of prepayments to certain vendors in our beacon study  and million of other net operating cash uses  partially offset by the receipt of million from collaboration agreements  of which million was included in accounts receivable at december  resulting from an upfront payment obligation arising from an amendment to one of our manufacturing and supply agreements 
we expect that cash flows used in operating activities  excluding upfront payments received  if any  will increase in as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs and  in particular  our beacon study 

table of contents during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of spending on operating costs and expenses and includes million for interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes  and was partially offset by a million upfront payment received from amgen under the supply  dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement that we entered into with amgen in october during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  which included the million upfront payment received from astrazeneca under the license agreement we entered into for nktr and nktr and a million license extension payment received from roche in december cash flows from investing activities we purchased million  million  and million of property and equipment in the years ended december    and  respectively
