table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  on pawn loan fees and service charges and consumer loan fees  allowance for losses on consumer loans and merchandise held for disposition  goodwill  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan fees and service charges revenue recognition 
pawn loans are short term loans made on the pledge of tangible personal property 
pawn loan fees and service charges revenue are accrued ratably over the term of the loan for the portion of those pawn loans deemed collectible 
the typical loan term is generally to days plus  in many cases  an additional grace period typically to days 
a pawn loan is considered nonperforming if the customer does not repay or  where allowed by law  renew or extend the loan at its contractual maturity plus any applicable grace period 
pawn loan fees and service charges do not accrue on nonperforming loans 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and assess the collectability of the principal balance in addition to pawn loan fees and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
with respect to the company s domestic pawn operations  for pawn loans that are not redeemed  the carrying value of the underlying collateral is stated at the lower of cost or market 
collateral underlying unredeemed pawn loans is reflected in merchandise held for disposition in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
upon sale of the merchandise  the company realizes gross profit  which is the difference between the amount loaned  or cost of sales  and the amount of proceeds from the sale 
the cost of disposed merchandise is computed on the specific identification basis 
interim customer payments for layaway sales are recorded as customer deposits and subsequently recognized as revenue during the period in which the final payment is received 
with respect to the company s foreign pawn operations  pledged collateral for nonperforming pawn loans is not owned by the company and is held in prepaid expenses and other assets until sold 
revenue that is recognized at the time the collateral is sold is reflected in pawn loan fees and service charges in the company s consolidated statements of income 
if the proceeds exceed the outstanding loan balance  the company recognizes as revenue accrued pawn loan fees and service charges  which includes other fees and expenses incurred in relation to the non payment and sale of the loan collateral on behalf of the customer at the time of the sale 
if the proceeds from the disposition of the collateral are less than the outstanding loan balance  a loss is recorded for the difference at the time the collateral is sold  which reduces the amount of pawn loan fees and service charges revenue from performing loans in the current period 
in the event the amount of proceeds exceeds the accrued service charges and all fees and expenses  the excess amount is recognized as revenue 
if  within six months of the sale of the merchandise  the customer makes a claim to receive the excess proceeds  the company refunds that amount to the customer and reduces revenue by the same amount 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded pawn loan fees and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the pawn loan fees and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of pawn loan fees and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of pawn loan fees and service charges revenue was overestimated or underestimated by  pawn loan fees and service charges revenue would decrease or increase by million in and net income attributable to the company would decrease or increase by million  net of taxes 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
any increase would be realized as additional service charge revenue 
merchandise held for disposition 
in the company s domestic operations  merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid and merchandise that is purchased directly from third parties or from customers 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral and other merchandise held for disposition is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or paid or market 
with respect to the company s foreign pawn operations  collateral underlying unredeemed pawn loans is not owned by the company  therefore  proceeds in excess of the amount loaned are recorded as pawn loan fees and service charges  rather than proceeds from disposition of merchandise when the collateral is sold 
management provides an allowance for returns and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise and historical shrinkage rates 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the 
table of contents company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with disposing of similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on multiple occasions on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
consumer loan fees 
upon completion of a transaction with a customer  funds are provided to the customer in exchange for an obligation to repay the amount advanced plus fees and any applicable interest  which takes the form of a consumer loan  and can be a loan written by the company or by a third party 
the company recognizes interest on consumer loans it writes and participation interests purchased from third parties on an effective yield basis ratably over the term of the loan 
unpaid and accrued interest and fees is reflected in consumer loans  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
fees generated through the company s cso programs are deferred and amortized over the term of the consumer loan arranged by the company and recorded as revenue 
the company classifies its consumer loan portfolio as either performing or nonperforming as described below in allowance for losses on consumer loans 
consumer loan fees and interest do not accrue on nonperforming loans  and once a loan is considered nonperforming  the company does not resume the accrual of interest on these loans 
for nonperforming loans  all payments received are first applied against accrued but unpaid interest and fees and then against the principal balance of the loan 
allowance for losses on consumer loans 
the company monitors the performance of its portfolio of consumer loans and maintains either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on consumer loans including fees and interest at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company s consumer loan portfolio consists of consumer loans the company originates  guarantees or purchases  including short term consumer loans  multi payment installment loans and participation interests in receivables acquired through its mloc channel 
the allowance for losses on the company s owned consumer loans offsets the outstanding loan amounts in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company maintains a liability for estimated losses related to loans guaranteed under the cso programs 
the liability for estimated losses related to guaranteed loans  which approximates the fair value of the liability  is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
in determining the allowance or liability for estimated losses on consumer loans  the company applies a documented systematic methodology 
outstanding loans are divided into discrete groups of short term loans  installment loans and mloc receivables and are analyzed as performing or nonperforming 
short term consumer loans and mloc receivables are considered nonperforming as of the payment due date when payment of an amount due has not been made as of that date after allowing for normal payment processing time 
an installment loan is considered nonperforming if the customer does not make two consecutive payments 
where permitted by law  a customer may choose to renew a performing short term consumer loan before it is considered nonperforming by agreeing to pay the current finance charge for the right to make payment of the outstanding principal balance at a later date plus an additional finance charge 
if a performing loan is renewed  the renewal is considered a new loan 
in some instances in the united kingdom  customers agree to repay a new short term loan in two payments which the company also considers short term loans  and in these cases the company considers the obligation to make the first payment as a new single payment loan and the obligation to make the second payment as a renewal of that loan because the customer pays a finance charge when each payment is made  similar to a renewed loan 
if a performing loan is renewed but the customer fails to pay that loan s current finance charge as of its due date after allowing for normal payment processing time  the loan that was renewed is reclassified as nonperforming to the extent of that loan s unpaid finance charge 
the company does not provide for any grace period when determining the performance status of a consumer loan other than allowing for normal payment processing time 
nonperforming loans may not be renewed  and if during its attempt to collect on a nonperforming loan the company extends the time for payment through a payment 
table of contents plan or a promise to pay  it is still considered nonperforming 
nonperforming loans are analyzed by stage of collection 
actual loss experience based on historical loss rates for each discrete group is calculated and adjusted for recent default trends 
the required allowance is calculated by applying the resulting adjusted loss rates to each discrete loan group and aggregating the results 
increases in either the allowance or the liability  net of charge offs and recoveries  are recorded as a consumer loan loss provision in the consolidated statements of income 
the company fully reserves and generally charges off all consumer loans once they have been classified as nonperforming for consecutive days 
if a loan is deemed uncollectible before it is fully reserved  it is charged off at that point 
all loans included in nonperforming loans have an age of one to days from the date they became nonperforming loans  as defined above 
recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected 
at december   the allowance for losses on consumer loans was million and liabilities for estimated losses on third party lender owned consumer loans were million  in aggregate representing of the combined consumer loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   the consumer loan loss provision for the combined consumer loan portfolio was million and reflects of gross combined consumer loans written by the company and third party lenders 
if the loss provision increased or decreased by  or million  from levels a change in the percentage of gross combined consumer loans written  net income attributable to the company would decrease  or increase  by million  net of taxes  for  assuming the same volume of consumer loans written in income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
asc requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
management must evaluate tax positions taken on the company s tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
management s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition under asc goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
in accordance with asc  goodwill subsequent measurement  the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually as of june and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to their carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting units was determined based on the income approach and then compared to the results of the market approach for reasonableness 
the income approach establishes fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost 
table of contents of capital developed using the capital asset pricing model  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit 
the income approach uses the company s projections of financial performance for a five year period and includes assumptions about future revenue growth rates  operating margins and terminal growth rates which vary among reporting units 
the market approach establishes fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint 
as of june   the annual assessment date  the company s reporting units had combined fair values that exceeded carrying value by 
the retail services segment and the e commerce segment had fair values that exceeded carrying value by and  respectively 
based on the results of this test  no impairment of goodwill was observed 
the company also performed a sensitivity analysis on the company s estimated fair value using the income approach 
a key assumption in the company s fair value estimate is the weighted average cost of capital utilized for discounting the company s cash flow estimates in the company s income approach 
holding all other assumptions constant at the annual assessment date  a basis point increase in the discount rates would reduce the enterprise value for the company s reporting units by million  and the combined fair value would exceed carrying value by 
there were no events or circumstances between june  and december  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company also evaluated its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of june  and noted no impairment 
the process of evaluating goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determination are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including the company s interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about the company s strategic plans with regard to the company s operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s conclusions regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
long lived asset and other intangible assets 
the company amortizes intangible assets subject to amortization on the basis of their expected periods of benefit  generally three to ten years 
the costs of start up activities and organization costs are charged to expense as incurred 
an evaluation of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is performed whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized if the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset and the estimated fair value of the asset are less than the asset s corresponding carrying value 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
equity securities 
the company accounts for its marketable and non marketable equity securities in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures and asc  investments other cost method investments  respectively 
the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and unrecognized gains and losses  net of tax  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of equity 
the company s non marketable equity securities are recorded on a cost basis 
the company evaluates marketable and non marketable equity securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other than temporary impairment is identified 
marketable and non marketable equity securities are held in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets
