through our schools  we are committed to providing high quality education  enabling students to graduate and pursue rewarding career opportunities 
we analyze performance and make decisions based on the allocation of resources  and as a result  in accordance with fasb asc topic segment reporting  we determined that the following reporting segments would be reported as of january  ctu  aiu  health education  culinary arts  art design and international 
this resulted in no change to our previously reported health education  culinary arts and international segments 
our previously reported university segment has been divided into three components ctu  aiu and art design 
as a result of the organizational restructure  we now have six reporting segments 
in addition  in november  we completed the sale of our istituto marangoni schools in milan  paris and london 
accordingly  the results of operations for the istituto marangoni schools are reported within discontinued operations 
all prior period results have been recast to reflect our reporting segments on a comparable basis 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the md a is intended to help investors understand the results of operations  financial condition and present business environment 
the md a is organized as follows overview and outlook consolidated results of operations segment results of operations 
table of contents summary of significant accounting policies and estimates liquidity  financial position and capital resources overview and outlook presented challenges for both the company and the industry in which we operate 
our industry experienced reduced new student interest due to economic conditions  negative publicity  extended student decision making timelines and changes in regulatory requirements 
the impact of these industry wide challenges  along with initiatives the company implemented in  resulted in a reduction in student population across our domestic institutions and a decline in average revenue per student  particularly within our culinary arts segment 
as a result  on a consolidated basis  revenue for the year ended december  declined million  or  from the prior year 
due to the timing of implementing initiatives as described below  the pace of revenue declines accelerated in the second half of  resulting in a significant reduction in operating margins 
we expect these trends to continue through at least the first half of changes in expected financial performance led us to reassess the fair value of each of our reporting units in connection with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in connection with this year s impairment test  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  of which million was reflected within health education and million within culinary arts  as the implied fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the le cordon bleu trade name 
in addition to the external factors impacting our institutions  we faced a number of internal challenges 
during  we transitioned several leadership positions within the company 
in march  the head of our health education segment left the company 
in addition  during the fourth quarter the senior vice president of culinary arts  the senior vice president of international and chief administrative officer  and the senior vice president of art design left the company 
the international business unit is now led by michael j 
graham  executive vice president and chief financial officer 
in january  erik i 
parks was named senior vice president of art design and jason t 
friesen was named senior vice president of health education 
effective october   gary e 
mccullough resigned as president  chief executive officer and board member 
the board appointed steven h 
lesnik as president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman of the board of directors 
the board has not set a deadline or strict timetable in connection with its search for a long term chief executive officer ceo and currently contemplates that mr 
lesnik will remain in his current roles through the end of during the second half of  the board will revisit its timing regarding the retention of a search firm for the ceo position 
we believe this strategy reflects good corporate governance practices while contemplating the current needs for internal and external continuity 
on november   the company received a letter from acics directing the company  on behalf of certain of its acics accredited institutions in the health education and art design segments  to show cause at acics december meeting 
this show cause directive relates to the adequacy of the admissions process and controls relative to our reporting of placement rates to acics 
on december   acics advised the company that it decided to defer further action on its show cause directive until its next regularly scheduled meeting in april the directive applied to all cec schools accredited by acics  including the acics accredited institutions in the health education  art design and culinary arts segments 
acics acknowledged the efforts cec had implemented to address concerns related to the verification of placement data  but seeks confirmation that the efforts will continue for a sustained period of time and be implemented at all campuses accredited by the agency 
while the show cause directive is in effect  acics will not accept any applications for new programs or the initiation of additional locations or campus additions 
representatives of the company will appear before acics at the april meeting 

table of contents on february   we notified ed that we believe six of our opeids representing campuses had rule percentages above for the fiscal year 
these six opeids contributed approximately million of revenues and million of operating income for fiscal year these institutions are now considered under ed regulations to be certified on a provisional basis for two years and will be subject to possible additional ed sanctions 
for  in addition to the six institutions discussed above  several of our other institutions had rule percentages near 
we are taking or considering various measures to reduce the percentage of our revenues attributable to title iv program funds  including emphasizing direct pay and employer paid education programs  supporting state workforce training development programs  encouraging students to carefully evaluate the amount of their title iv borrowing  developing work study programs  eliminating certain programs  and increasing tuition 
in response to these challenges  during the year the majority of our domestic institutions implemented initiatives to better position themselves to further student success and to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape 
these initiatives align with the company s mission of putting our students success first 
a few of the initiatives include we implemented our new culinary arts business model and began to implement changes to our art design business model 
we believe these changes will improve the relative competitive positioning of the institutions  as well as position certain of our programs to achieve compliance with the recent gainful employment rules 
we introduced new entrance requirements across the majority of our domestic institutions to identify students who may not be ready for college level studies 
we executed new contracts with our lead aggregator partners and introduced new compensation programs for admissions representatives in response to ed rules which became effective july  we commenced corrective action and implemented enhanced controls and procedures with respect to the determination of placement rates  including changes in career services personnel  the creation of a new director of career services compliance position and the adoption of a new career services policy manual which includes procedures regarding the verification and documentation of graduate placements 
we also began to utilize the services of an independent third party to provide placement reverification services to further audit placement activity 
we are also planning to limit enrollments or teach out programs for which employment opportunities may not be readily available 
we made the decision to consolidate as many as nineteen separate nationally accredited opeids into a single opeid 
we have been working with ed  acics and numerous state regulators over the past several months and our application is pending 
this decision led to a change in how we accounted for the accreditation rights  specifically the reclassification of certain accreditation rights from indefinite lived to definite lived  which resulted in an additional million of expense being reflected within the statement of operations 
we joined a group of institutions that agreed to a new set of voluntary standards of conduct 
in september  as one of the founding members  we signed the new standards of responsible conduct and transparency which will ensure that prospective students have access to comprehensive information about program costs and student outcomes so they can make better informed decisions 
the standards address five key pillars  which include enrollment  disclosure  financial aid  student readiness and career and job services assistance 
its most noteworthy provision is the ability for a student to either participate in an orientation program and or withdraw from a program in the first days or equivalent  or both  without incurring costs other than nominal fees for application and materials and supplies 
we expect to be a year not without its challenges  however  we remain comitted to our overarching mission of putting our students first 
our first imperative is to resolve the current regulatory challenges within our career focused institutions  starting with the show cause directive from acics 
we will also focus on doing everything that we can to help our graduates obtain employment in this challenging economic environment 

table of contents finally  we will take measures to address the rule challenges that some of our institutions face 
we believe the actions undertaken to address placement rates and rule percentages in our domestic schools are likely to negatively impact our financial results in  most notably within the health education and culinary arts segments 
our second imperative is to simplify our organization 
we have made good progress in in leveraging shared services and have worked towards simplifying our regulatory complexity by initiating a project to consolidate up to nineteen of our nationally accredited opeids into one 
we have created a new leadership position within the company to oversee all of our career focused institutions within our health education  culinary arts and art design segments 
we are currently searching to fill this position which will focus on identifying opportunities to better leverage their collective assets and to bring better consistency and scale across their seventy plus campuses 
our final imperative is creating advantage in the marketplace through differentiating our very strong education brands 
our commitment to investing in our strong brands will continue 
following the rebranding of our existing culinary arts campuses with the le cordon bleu name in  we intend to further invest in improving the brand recognition and differentiation of ctu in we will seek to strongly support a more limited number of brands  differentiating our institutions offerings from those of our competitors 
the quality of our teachers and teaching systems  our tradition of innovation  particularly in technology  and our ability to invest in learning techniques all will contribute to this differentiation

we experienced a decline in new student interest across all of our domestic institutions  resulting in a decline in new students starts of as compared to the prior year 
this decline in new student starts  as well as increased attrition rates  drove a decrease in student population as compared to the prior year  which contributed to the decline in revenue year over year 
additionally  aiu and culinary arts continued to experience lower revenue per student as compared to the prior year due to deceleration in the aiu student s pace of study and a change in degree mix of culinary arts students resulting from the business model changes that were implemented in the third quarter international s revenue increased million to million in and was positively impacted by million in favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year  despite a decline in revenue 
the increase is due to increased academics expense most notably with health education and international 
the increase in health education is primarily due to deleveraging of the business 
as class size declines  due to reductions in new student starts  the academic cost per student increases 
international s academics expense increased as compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in student population and continued investments associated with higher levels of accreditation

our prior year results included additional bad debt expense of million related to the increase in reserve rates applied against our outstanding student receivables under extended payment plans as well as million of additional bad debt expense resulting from the correction of an error 
the remainder of the decline in expense is primarily attributable to our decision to cease offering extended student payment plans to new students effective in the first quarter  as well as an overall decline in revenue as compared to the prior year 
admissions expense decreased as compared to the prior year driven by decreases in all of our domestic segments 
an overall decline in new student leads  combined with efforts to streamline our operations to build greater efficiencies  caused this decrease in expense as compared to prior year 
advertising expense decreased million as compared to the prior year due to a change in marketing strategy focused on obtaining less new student interest leads from potential students with a lower propensity to start or persist in our programs  as well as decreased spending in certain marketing channels 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the capital expenditures incurred in related to our new campus support center 
in addition  amortization expense increased as compared to the prior year due to the reclassification of certain accreditation rights intangible assets from indefinite lived to definite lived and thus the recognition of amortization expense related to these intangible assets in the current year 
this resulted from the decision to consolidate many of our institutions under one institution for purposes of title iv program funding 
goodwill and asset impairment during  we recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges of million  which consisted primarily of million recorded within health education and million recorded within culinary arts

operating expenses remained relatively stable as compared to the prior year due to effective cost management 
international 
current year revenue increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
the increase was driven by a increase in student population and million of revenue related to the ium acquisition 
excluding a million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates  revenues would have increased 
operating income increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue was partially offset with higher operating expenses  including academic costs related to the support of the growing student population  as well as the integration of ium 
operating income was impacted by a million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and an operating loss of million for ium

this category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company 
corporate and other costs increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
the current year results include million of bad debt expense incurred from our previously terminated recourse loan program and million of asset impairment charges offset with cost efficiencies which resulted in the reduction of certain operating expenses  including occupancy costs 
the prior year results include million of additional performance based compensation expense related to incentive plan outperformance  offset by the receipt of million related to the termination of certain insurance policies 

table of contents summary of significant accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for a one time registration fee at the beginning of the student s program and we recognize the registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over that program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
we generally bill student tuition fees at the beginning of each academic term  and we recognize the tuition fees as revenue on a straight line basis over either the academic term or program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
the tuition fees earnings method is determined by the type of program a student is enrolled in 
typically  schools that offer our culinary arts and some of our health programs earn tuition fees over the entire course of the program while the remainder of our schools earn tuition fees over each academic term 
the portion of tuition and registration fees payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
deferred tuition revenue is stated net of outstanding student receivables on a student by student basis as of the end of the reporting period 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term or program period  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
generally  the amount of funds to be refunded to a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and registration fees paid by the student as of their withdrawal date 
such refunds typically reduce deferred tuition revenue and cash on our consolidated balance sheet as generally we do not recognize tuition revenue in our consolidated statement of operations until related refund provisions have lapsed 
the portion of deferred revenue we are entitled to retain is immediately recognized into revenue with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense for the amount deemed to be uncollectible 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms or payment periods 
academic terms or payment periods are determined by regulatory requirements mandated by the federal government and or appropriate accrediting body  which also vary by school and program 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school  the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  school payment plans  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  and cafeteria revenue 
revenue derived from dormitory and cafeteria services is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  restaurant revenue  and contract training revenue  is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit  are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term or program period 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools for tuition and certain other educational costs 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible 
as such  our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible 
our standard allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on our credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source third party  internal short term and extended payment plans  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our results from operations 
additionally  we monitor certain internal and external factors  including changes in our academic programs  as well as changes in the current economic  legislative and regulatory environments 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we review goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under fasb asc topic goodwill is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit can be a strategic business unit or business within a strategic business unit 
the first step compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value  as determined by its discounted cash flows 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we complete the second step to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows  market assumptions and comparative market multiple methods 
determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors  such as marketplace participants  relative market share  new student interest  student retention  future expansion or contraction expectations  amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results 
table of contents and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a on form k 
as a result of this year s impairment test  a million goodwill impairment charge was recorded  of which was reflected within health education and million within culinary arts  as the implied fair value of each reporting unit was less than its reporting amount 
as a result of this impairment  the culinary arts reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of december  in addition  a million impairment charge was recorded related to the le cordon bleu trade name 
as of december   we had million of goodwill remaining 
the fair values of our aiu  ctu and international reporting units exceeded their carrying values by substantial amounts fair value exceeded carrying value for these reporting units by a range of to and thus  did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations 
however  the goodwill associated with our art design and health education reporting units have elevated risk due to their exposure to the current regulatory environment and required changes in the business model  namely  the rule and gainful employment 
the assumptions used in the valuation of these reporting units were made using management s best projections 
the fair value of these two reporting units exceeded its carrying values by and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value for these two reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value for these two reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in an impairment for either of these reporting units 
we continue to monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long lived assets we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such adverse events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
see note property and equipment of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the estimated fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
see note property and equipment of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long lived asset impairment considerations and related charges 
contingencies in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  we analyze whether it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred  and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if 
table of contents the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable  then we accrue for costs  including direct costs incurred  associated with the loss contingency 
if no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible  we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made 
loss contingencies include  but are not limited to  possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
topic requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
topic also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
topic further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
liquidity  financial position  and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
our cash flows from operations have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements 
we finance our operating activities and our organic growth primarily through cash generated from operations 
we finance acquisitions primarily through funding from credit facility borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with  among other things  our working capital needs  capital expenditures and lease commitments through at least the next months primarily with cash generated by operations  existing cash balances  and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreement 
included in cash and cash equivalents within our consolidated balance sheets are amounts related to certain of our european campuses that are operated as not for profit schools 
the cash and cash equivalents related to these schools have restrictions which require that the funds be utilized for these particular not for profit schools 
the amount of not for profit cash and cash equivalents with restrictions was million and million at december  and  respectively 
restrictions on these cash balances have not affected  nor do we believe that such restrictions will affect  our ability to fund our daily operations 

table of contents as of december  and  our foreign subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have not provided for additional us income taxes on approximately million of foreign subsidiary earnings as these earnings are considered permanently invested in those businesses 
such earnings could become taxable upon sale or liquidation of these non us subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation of cash balances 
this cash is associated with earnings that we consider permanently reinvested 
in connection with our recent sale of the istituto marangoni schools  we plan during to repatriate those earnings of approximately million as a result of the divesture of the asset 
we currently have no further plans to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to support our operations and continued growth plans outside the united states through funding of capital expenditures  acquisitions  operating expenses or other similar cash needs of these operations 
further  we do not currently forecast a need for these funds in the united states because the company s us operations are supported by the cash generated by its us operations 
at december   approximately million of our total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held by our us operations 
the company would only plan on repatriating the remaining foreign cash when it would be tax efficient through the utilization of foreign tax credits  when earnings qualify as previously taxed income  upon material changes in us or foreign tax laws related to repatriation  upon divestiture of the related asset  or in the event of a material domestic capital requirement 
sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million and million  respectively 
our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students 
our students finance tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  school payment plans  private and institutional scholarships and cash payments 
for the twelve months ended december   and  approximately   and respectively  of our us schools cash receipts from tuition payments come from title iv program funding 
for further discussion of title iv program funding and alternative private loan funding sources for our students  see student financial aid and alternative student financial aid sources in part i  item business of this annual report on form k 
our primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include  among other things  cash paid to employees for services  to vendors for products and services  to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities  to suppliers for textbooks and other school supplies  and to federal  state and local governments for income and other taxes 
although we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy cash requirements for working capital needs  capital expenditures  and commitments through at least the next year primarily with cash generated by our operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreement  we are not able to assess the effect of loss contingencies on future cash requirements and liquidity 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these matters 
investing cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash flows used in investing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the cash outflows related to investing activities 
table of contents was primarily driven by investments in our new campus support center in the prior year  and the current year including net proceeds from the sale of our istituto marangoni schools 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures decreased million  or from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  capital expenditures represented and of total revenue of continuing and discontinued operations during the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were higher in the prior year due to the increased investment in our new campus support center in acquisition of everblue training institute 
on december  we acquired everblue training institute for approximately million 
the purchase price was funded with cash generated from operating activities 
acquisition of international university of monaco 
on april   we acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of international university of monaco for approximately million  excluding acquired cash balances of approximately million 
the purchase price was funded with cash generated from operating activities 
acquisition of the rights to the lcb brand earnout payments 
effective august   we acquired the outright rights to the le cordon bleu brand in the education services field for the us and canada 
the purchase price for the brand rights consisted of million in cash funded from operations  million shares of our common stock valued at million as of the closing date and originally estimated million of earnout payments over a month period 
as of december   we have made approximately million in earnout payments since acquisition of the brand 
we estimate that an additional million will be paid within the next four months related to the month earnout 
proceeds on sale of business  net of cash divested 
on november   we received million of net proceeds upon the completion of the sale of our istituto marangoni schools in milan  paris and london  net of cash divested of approximately million 
proceeds on the sale of assets 
during the year ended december   we received million in gross proceeds in connection with the sale of property located in california 
purchases and sales of available for sale investments 
purchases and sales of available for sale investments resulted in a net cash outflow of million and a net cash inflow of million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash flows used in financing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
credit agreement 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our us credit agreement and letters of credit totaling approximately million 
our us credit agreement provides for borrowings up to million and includes certain financial covenants 
as of december   we are in compliance with these covenants 
our us credit agreement expires on october  due to the economic uncertainty in the us and the industry in which we operate  we cannot predict with certainty whether this agreement or any new agreement will be renewed  or if renewed  with terms or borrowing capacity as favorable as the prior agreement 
see note credit agreement of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our outstanding credit agreement 
repurchases of stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million at an average price of per share 
during the year ended 
table of contents december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million at an average price of per share 
repurchases of stock during and were funded by cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   approximately million was available under our authorized stock repurchase program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
stock repurchases under this program may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time  depending on various factors  including market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
on november   we entered into a stock repurchase plan established in accordance with rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act  in connection with our previously authorized stock repurchase program 
a rule b plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be unable to do so under the act s insider trading rules 
this stock repurchase plan facilitated purchases of our common stock under our previously authorized stock repurchase program 
purchases of common stock under this plan were subject to specified parameters and certain price and volume restraints as established in the plan 
during january  our designated broker repurchased on our behalf an additional million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share under this plan 
as a result  approximately million was available under our previously authorized stock repurchase program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock as of january  payment of assumed loans 
in conjunction with our acquisition of ium in the prior year  we assumed loans in the amount of million 
repayment of these loans was made immediately after the acquisition closed 
contractual obligations as of december   future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations  including  among others  non cancelable operating and capital lease agreements  and other long term arrangements  were as follows thereafter total dollars in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations payments related to acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the capital lease obligations include both the future principal payment amount as well as an amount calculated for expected future interest payments 
the amount represents the estimated remaining earnout obligation related to our acquisition of the rights to the lcb brand in the educational services field for the us and canada 
the amount represents the estimated earnout obligation related to our acquisition of everblue training institute  which is recorded as compensation expense in our consolidated results of operations ratably over the related service period 
see note business acquisition of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
these estimates are as of december  and are subject to adjustments based on future operating results 
due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes  we do not know the timing of when our obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits will occur  if at all 
see note income taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

table of contents operating lease obligations 
we lease most of our administrative and educational facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through lease terms generally range from five to ten years with one to two renewal options for extended terms 
the amounts included in the table above represent future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases for continuing operations and discontinued operations 
capital lease obligations 
we have assumed capital lease obligations in connection with certain acquisitions as well as financed certain equipment purchases under capital lease arrangements 
as of december   the balance of outstanding capital lease obligations was approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we were not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements  nor do we have any unconsolidated subsidiaries 
changes in financial position december  compared to december  selected consolidated balance sheet account changes from december   to december   were as follows as of december  change dollars in thousands assets current assets other current assets non current assets goodwill intangible assets  net other assets  net liabilities and stockholders equity current liabilities accrued expenses payroll and related benefits other non current liabilities other liabilities stockholders equity cost of shares in treasury  nm other current assets and other non current assets  net these changes were primarily driven by the reclassification of our tenant improvement allowance for our new campus support center from long term to short term based upon the expected date of receipt 
the current amount due for this tenant improvement allowance is million 
goodwill and intangible assets  net the decreases in the goodwill and intangible assets balances primarily relate to goodwill impairment charges for two of our domestic reporting units  as well as a trade name impairment charge related to our lcb trade name 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for detail related to these impairment charges 
accrued expenses payroll and related benefits the decrease is mainly due to lower expected payments of the annual employee incentive bonus as compared to the prior year expected payments 
accrued expenses other the decrease is primarily related to the first quarter payment of a million legal settlement recorded in the prior year 

table of contents non current liabilities other liabilities the increase is driven by a reclassification in tax reserves from short term to long term based upon the timing for ultimate resolution of the matters 
cost of shares in treasury the increase in cost of shares in treasury was driven by the retirement of million shares of treasury stock with a total value of million during the fourth quarter of as well as the repurchase of million of our common stock in the current year

recent accounting pronouncements see note recent accounting pronouncements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our municipal bond investments are auction rate securities ars which generally have stated terms to maturity of greater than one year 
we classify investments in ars on our consolidated balance sheets within other non current assets 
auctions can fail when the number of sellers of the security exceeds the buyers for that particular auction period 
in the event that an auction fails  the interest rate resets at a rate based on a formula determined by the individual security 
the ars for which auctions have failed continue to accrue interest and are auctioned on a set interval until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as of december   we have determined these investments are at risk for impairment due to the nature of the liquidity of the market over the past year 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative unrealized loss reflected within other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately million as of december  interest rate exposure any outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement bear annual interest at fluctuating rates as determined by the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
our investments and debt instruments are recorded at their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   was not significant to our consolidated financial position 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
