table of contents overview novavax  inc  a delaware corporation novavax  the company  we  or us  was incorporated in  and is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel recombinant vaccines to address a broad range of infectious diseases 
our goal is to become a profitable vaccine company that is aggressively driving towards development  licensure and commercialization of important vaccines worldwide 
our technology platform is based on proprietary recombinant vaccine technology that includes vlps and recombinant nanoparticle vaccines combined with a single use bioprocessing production system 
our vaccine candidates are genetically engineered three dimensional nanostructures that incorporate immunologically important recombinant proteins 
our product pipeline targets a variety of infectious diseases and our vaccine candidates are currently in or have completed clinical trials that target pandemic influenza hn  seasonal influenza and rsv 
cpl biologicals private limited the jv  our joint venture formed in between us and cadila  of which is owned by us and is owned by cadila 
the jv will develop and manufacture our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates and cadila s biogeneric products and other diagnostic products for the territory of india 
in june  the jv opened its newly constructed state of the art manufacturing facility  funded by cadila  to be used to produce pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines  as well as other vaccine candidates 
the jv is actively developing a rabies vaccine candidate that was genetically engineered by novavax  it recently completed initial pre clinical immunogenicity studies on this vaccine candidate and is progressing with pre clinical toxicology studies 
because we do not control the jv  we account for our investment using the equity method 
since the carrying value of our contribution was nominal and there is no guarantee or commitment to provide future funding  we have not recorded nor do we expect to record losses related to this investment in the future 
a current summary of our significant research and development programs and status of development follows

program development phase pandemic influenza hn phase ii ended pandemic influenza hn phase ii seasonal influenza phase ii respiratory syncytial virus rsv phase i rabies through jv pre clinical hhs barda contract award for recombinant influenza vaccines in february  we were awarded a contract from hhs barda valued at million for the first month base period  with an hhs barda option for an additional period of months valued at million  for a total contract value of up to million 
the hhs barda contract award provides significant funding for our ongoing clinical development and product scale up of both our seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates 
this is a cost plus fixed fee contract in which hhs barda will reimburse us for direct contract costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs and a fee earned in the further development of our seasonal and pandemic hn influenza vaccines 
during  we recognized revenue of approximately million  made significant progress in product characterization and production scale up and are progressing forward with our multi year clinical development program 
pandemic influenza hn in and  we dedicated significant resources to demonstrate our ability to develop a recombinant vlp vaccine against this latest pandemic influenza strain 
we produced a non cgmp hn vlp vaccine candidate within weeks after the genetic sequence of the novel hn virus was announced and manufactured a cgmp vaccine candidate within weeks of the announcement 
we conducted a phase ii clinical trial in mexico  in collaboration with laboratorio avi mex sa de sa and ge healthcare  and published the final data results last year and presented at the world health organization who meeting for the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in clinical trials 
our results showed that our hn vlp vaccine exceeded the immunogenicity criteria for seasonal influenza vaccine licensure at all dose levels  
table of contents including the lowest g dose and that a single administration of the vlp vaccine induced high levels of hai titers in subjects without pre existing detectable immunity to hn influenza 
although hn influenza is no longer considered a pandemic and is being addressed as an active strain in the determination of ongoing seasonal influenza strains  we nevertheless expect that the data from our hn clinical trials will be used to support our pandemic hn and seasonal influenza vlp vaccine programs in the us and in other countries 
pandemic influenza hn we have made significant progress in the development of our vaccine that targets the hn influenza strain 
in  we released results from an important pre clinical study in which ferrets that received our hn vaccine candidate were protected from a lethal challenge of the hn virus 
after filing an ind  we initiated a phase i iia clinical trial 
we released interim data from the first portion of this clinical trial in december these interim results demonstrated that our pandemic influenza vaccine can generate a protective immune response 
we conducted the second portion of the phase i iia trial in to gather additional subject immunogenicity and safety data and determine a final dose through the completion of this clinical trial 
in august  we reported favorable results from this clinical trial  which demonstrated strong neutralizing antibody titers across all three doses tested 
the vaccine was well tolerated at all dose levels as compared with placebo  and no serious adverse events were reported 
the vaccine also induced robust hai responses  which have been shown to be important for protection against influenza disease 
in conjunction with our hhs barda contract  in  we expect to launch two phase i trials of our vaccine candidate in combination with several alternative adjuvant candidates 
these trials will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccines in the presence and absence of adjuvants  the ability of vlp vaccine antigens with and without adjuvants to generate antibody levels that fulfill the fda s criteria for accelerated approval  and the ability of these vaccines to provide an expanded number of doses and possible cross protection against other virus strains to the us population 
seasonal influenza we are actively developing our vlp vaccine that targets the seasonal influenza virus 
in april  we reported the final results of our phase ii trial in older adults years of age or older in a dose ranging study comparing our seasonal trivalent three strain influenza vlp vaccine with a commercially available inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine tiv 
the results showed that the vaccine was both safe and immunogenic against the seasonal influenza virus strains in older adults 
the cdc has indicated that currently approved seasonal influenza vaccines may be suboptimally effective in preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza in older adults  however  we believe that some features of our seasonal influenza vlp vaccine have the potential to offer improved efficacy 
in  we initiated a seasonal influenza phase ii dose ranging trial using both trivalent and quadrivalent four strains formulations 
we developed a quadrivalent formulation of our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate as many influenza vaccine manufacturers move from trivalent to quadrivalent formulations  an industry move that has been acknowledged by who and the fda 
at the conclusion of the trial  we will select the optimal quadrivalent dose and expect to initiate a dose confirmatory phase ii trial in the second half of a phase iii registration trial is expected to begin in late respiratory syncytial virus rsv we have developed a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine to prevent rsv 
in pre clinical studies  we have demonstrated positive results in models designed to test the safety and efficacy of our rsv vaccine candidate 
in december  we initiated a blinded  placebo controlled  dose escalating phase i trial to assess the safety and tolerability of aluminum phosphate adjuvanted and unadjuvanted formulations of our rsv vaccine candidate 
a secondary objective of the study was to evaluate total and neutralizing anti rsv antibody responses and assess the impact of the adjuvant 
the study enrolled healthy adults to years old who were allocated to six cohorts that included four dose levels of vaccine 
the primary safety findings were local pain and tenderness at the site of injection  the majority of which were mild in nature with no dose related increase observed 
there were no observed vaccine related serious adverse events or trends for related systemic side effects 
the antibody response to the rsv f protein was significantly increased compared to 
table of contents placebo p in all groups and increased by fold in the highest dose group at day a significant dose response pattern was observed 
high rates of seroconversion were seen at all doses including a rate of at the highest dose adjuvant group 
in  we expect to initiate two separate dose ranging phase ii trials in older adults and women of child bearing age 
license agreement with lgls in february  we entered into a licensing agreement with lgls that allows lgls to use our vlp technology to develop and commercially sell our influenza vaccines in south korea and certain other emerging market countries 
lgls received an exclusive license to our influenza vlp technology in south korea and a non exclusive license in the other specified countries 
at its own cost  lgls is responsible for funding its clinical development of the influenza vlp vaccines and completing a manufacturing facility in south korea 
we received an upfront payment and may receive reimbursements of certain development and product costs and royalty payments between and from lgls s future commercial sales of influenza vlp vaccines 
at market sales in march  we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement  under which we could sell an aggregate of million in gross proceeds of our common stock 
our board of directors has authorized the sale of up to million shares of our common stock pursuant to the at market issuance sales agreement 
during  we sold  shares of our common stock at a range of and received net proceeds of million with million received in early under the at market issuance sales agreement 
since entering into the at market issuance sales agreement through march   we have sold  shares of our common stock and received gross proceeds of million 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to accounting for revenue  the valuation of our short term investments  stock based compensation  long lived assets  goodwill and valuation of our warrants and net deferred tax assets have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
revenue we currently derive revenue from a cost plus fixed fee contract in which hhs barda will reimburse us for direct contract costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs and a fee earned in the further development of our seasonal and pandemic hn influenza vaccines 
revenue on this cost plus fixed fee contract is recognized as costs are incurred plus allowable indirect costs and the fee earned 
billings under the contract are based on approved provisional indirect billing rates  which permit recovery of fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses not exceeding certain limits 
these indirect rates will be subject to audit by hhs barda on an annual basis 
when the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made  revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly 

table of contents short term investments our short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities  if determined to be temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we assess the recoverability of our short term investments and  if an impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
other than temporary impairments are included in the statements of operations 
in  we invested in auction rate securities as part of our cash management program 
since that time  uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us from liquidating certain holdings of auction rate securities as the amount of securities submitted for sale during the auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
although an event of an auction failure does not necessarily mean that a security is impaired  we consider various factors to assess the fair value and the classification of the securities as short term investments 
fair value was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation firm using two valuation methods a discounted cash flow method and a market comparable method 
certain factors used in these methods include  but are not necessarily limited to  comparable securities traded on secondary markets  timing of the failed auction  specific security auction history  quality of underlying collateral  rating of the security and the bond insurer  our ability and intent to retain the securities for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in the market value and other factors 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to these securities in  which was partially offset by realized gains of million relating to redemptions of several auction rate securities 
since that time  changes in the fair value of our auction rate securities have been included in other comprehensive income on the balance sheets 
at december   we have recorded million in unrealized gains on the auction rate securities held by us at year end 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for those awards expected to vest 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected term of the award 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look back period corresponding to the expected term 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting exercise and forfeiture history 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
also  the accounting estimate of stock based compensation expense is reasonably likely to change from period to period as further stock options are granted and adjustments are made for stock option cancellations 
impairments of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets by performing a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of 
table of contents impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 
goodwill goodwill originally resulted from a business acquisition in assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
we utilize the market approach and  if considered necessary  the income approach to determine if we have an impairment of our goodwill 
the market approach serves as the primary approach and is based on market value of invested capital 
the concluded fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of our goodwill at december  and the income approach is used as a confirming look to the market approach 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  which we test annually at december given the current economic conditions and the uncertainties regarding their impact on us  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future  or that any change in the assumptions or the current economic conditions will not trigger more frequently than on an annual basis 
if our assumptions are not achieved or economic conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
warrant accounting we account for warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in asc  derivatives and hedging  as derivative liabilities 
as such  warrants have been classified as a non current liability in the company s statements of operations 
in compliance with applicable accounting standards  registered warrants that require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to cash settlement are accounted for as derivative liabilities 
we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the warrants 
as a result  the valuation of warrants is subjective  and the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and probability of a fundamental transaction a strategic merger or sale 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we could  at any point in time  ultimately incur amounts significantly different than the carrying value 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax position requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  the applicable statute of limitations  and potential limitations on available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 

table of contents a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by presenting it in either a single statement or two statement approach 
this asu is effective for us beginning january  the adoption of asu will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to give both public and non public entities the option to qualitatively determine whether they can bypass the two step goodwill impairment test 
under the new guidance  if an entity chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not a more than likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would then perform step of the annual goodwill impairment test in asc and  if necessary  proceed to step otherwise  no further evaluation would be necessary 
the decision to perform a qualitative assessment is made at the reporting unit level  and an entity with multiple reporting units may utilize a mix of qualitative assessments and quantitative tests among its reporting units 
the amended guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
results of operations for fiscal years  and amounts in tables are presented in thousands  except per share information the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of novavax  inc and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto set forth in this annual report on form k

these expenses include salaries  laboratory supplies  consultants and subcontractors and other expenses associated with our process development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory and quality assurance activities for internally funded programs 
in addition  indirect costs such as  fringe benefits and overhead expenses  are also included in research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to work performed under the hhs barda contract and as such  is being recorded as cost of contract revenue  and to a lesser extent lower outside testing costs including outsourced clinical trial costs  sponsored research and consulting agreements as a result of fewer clinical trials on going during for  we expect a significant decrease in research and development expenses due to our focus on the hhs barda contract  partially offset by two anticipated clinical trials in rsv an internally funded program at this time 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expense was primarily due to higher employee related costs of million and increased depreciation expense of million 
costs and expenses by functional area we track our cost of contract revenue and research and development expenses by the type of costs incurred in identifying  developing  manufacturing and testing vaccine candidates 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area and therefore believe that project by project information would not form a reasonable basis for disclosure to our investors 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development programs 
historically  we did not account for internal research and development expenses by project  since our employees work time is spread across multiple programs and our internal manufacturing clean room facility produces multiple vaccine candidates 
the following summarizes our cost of contract revenue and research and development expenses by functional area for the year ended december in millions

manufacturing vaccine discovery clinical regulatory total cost of contract revenue and research and development expenses we do not provide forward looking estimates of costs and time to complete our research programs due to the many uncertainties associated with vaccine development 
as we obtain data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay trials in order to focus our resources on more promising vaccine candidates 
completion of trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary substantially depending upon the phase  size of trial  primary and secondary endpoints and the intended use of the vaccine candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  if trial locations are domestic  international or both  the time to enroll patients  
table of contents the duration of treatment and follow up  the safety and efficacy profile of the vaccine candidate  and the cost and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  and to what extent  we will generate future cash flows from our research projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher employee related costs  including severance expenses  partially offset by lower professional fees

based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances as of december   anticipated revenue under the contract with hhs barda that was awarded in february  possible proceeds from the sales of our common stock under our at market issuance sales agreement and our current business operations  we believe we have adequate capital resources available to operate at planned levels for at least the next twelve months 
additional capital will be required in the future to develop our vaccine candidates through clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization 
our ability to generate revenue under the hhs barda contract is subject to our performance under the contract  our ability to raise funds under our at market issuance sales agreement is subject to both our business performance and market conditions 
further we will seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  non dilutive government contracts  collaborative arrangements or some combination of these financing alternatives 
any capital raised by an equity offering will likely be substantially dilutive to the existing stockholders and any licensing or development arrangement may require us to give up rights to a product or technology at less than its full potential value 
other than our at market issuance sales agreement and the improvement allowance  we have not secured any additional commitments for new financing nor can we provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to perform under the hhs barda contract or obtain additional capital  we will assess our capital resources and will likely be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our organization or reduce our general and administrative infrastructure

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and working capital of million 
our exposure to market risk is primarily confined to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our short term investments were classified as available for sale 
we do not believe that a change in the market rates of interest would have any significant impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on our investments when they mature and the proceeds are reinvested into new investments and  therefore  could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in  we invested in auction rate securities as part of our cash management program 
short term investments at december  are comprised of investments in three auction rate securities with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to these securities in  which was partially offset by realized gains of million in relating to redemptions of several auction rate securities 
at december   we have recorded million in unrealized gains on the auction rate securities included in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
these investments are classified within current assets because we may need to liquidate these securities within the next year to fund our ongoing operations 
interest and dividend income is recorded when earned and included in interest income 
premiums and discounts  if any  on short term investments are amortized or accreted to maturity and included in interest income 
the specific identification method is used in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of our securities 
we are headquartered in the us where we conduct the vast majority of our business activities 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we do not have material debt and  as such  do not believe that we are exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of our borrowing activities
