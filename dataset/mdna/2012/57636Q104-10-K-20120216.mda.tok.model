net revenue generated in the united states was  and of total net revenue in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period  but differences in market growth  economic health  and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time 
while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries  the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
unprecedented events which began during impacted the financial markets around the world  including continued distress in the credit environment  continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention 
the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil 
more recently  countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies  including several in europe as well as the united states 
in addition  some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments 
many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence  including potential further changes in laws and regulations 
many of our financial institution customers  merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted

mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry 
for example  in our asia 
table of contents pacific and latin american regions  we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the united states and europe we have recently experienced significant growth in dollar volume despite mixed economic indicators 
notwithstanding recent encouraging trends  the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business

impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real 
the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro  and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real

table of contents real  which decreased revenues and expenses by approximately percentage point 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume gev  which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives 
in most non european regions  gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period 
in europe  gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period 
as a result  our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most non european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis

revenues revenue descriptions mastercard s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders  merchants  issuers the cardholders financial institutions and acquirers the merchants financial institutions 
our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands  the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar  euro and brazilian real 
we process transactions denominated in more than currencies through our global system  providing cardholders with the ability to utilize  and merchants to accept  mastercard cards across multiple country borders 
we process most of the cross border transactions using mastercard  maestro and cirrus branded cards and process the majority of mastercard branded domestic transactions in the united states  united kingdom  canada  brazil and a select number of other smaller countries 
our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes  types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers 
a combination of the following factors determines the pricing domestic or cross border signature based credit and debit or pin based debit  including automated teller machine atm cash withdrawals and retail purchases tiered pricing  with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume transaction hurdles geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal processed or not processed by mastercard in general  cross border transactions generate higher revenue than domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees  and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion 
we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis 
in addition  standard pricing varies among our regional businesses  and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 
the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories domestic assessments domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and the issuer country are the same 
a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
in addition  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments  which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes  such as acceptance development or market development programs

cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases and cash disbursements from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
cross border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services 
transaction processing fees transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions 
these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service 
transaction processing fees include charges for the following transaction switching authorization  clearing and settlement 
a 
authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted  by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer s instructions or applicable rules also known as stand in 
our standards  which may vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 
fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers 
b 
clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction 
mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems 
mastercard clearing solutions can be managed with minimal system development  which has enabled us to accelerate our customers ability to develop customized programs and services 
fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers 
c

once clearing is completed  a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement  detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position 
fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers 
connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company s network 
other revenues other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors  such as contractual agreements 
examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions 
this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants 
cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard branded cards  such as insurance  telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines

mastercard has no off balance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented below in the future obligations table 

table of contents future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 
payments due by period total and thereafter in millions capital leases operating leases sponsorship  licensing and other   total mostly related to certain property  plant and equipment 
the capital lease for the global technology and operations center located in o fallon  missouri has been excluded from this table  see note property  plant and equipment to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
there is a capital lease for the kansas city  missouri co processing data center 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements 
amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the mastercard brand 
the amounts included are fixed and non cancelable 
in addition  these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing  computer hardware maintenance  software licenses and other service agreements 
future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred 
mastercard has accrued million as of december  related to customer and merchant agreements 
includes current liability of million relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non current liabilities for uncertainties in income taxes  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority

seasonality our fourth quarter results typically include higher customer and merchant incentives  which are recorded as contra revenue  due to higher contract renewal activity and increased purchase volume and promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period  generally reducing our net revenue 
the fourth quarter also generally includes increased advertising and marketing expenses  primarily due to promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period and the timing of advertising and promotional campaigns 
critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly gdv or gev to recognize quarterly domestic assessments 
in  domestic assessments included an estimate representing and of total domestic assessments and total net revenues  respectively 
domestic assessments included an estimate representing and of total domestic assessments and total net revenues in both and our revenue recognition policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
customers gdv and gev are estimated by using historical performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated against the gdv or gev reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 
historically  our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than of the estimates on a quarterly basis 
rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customer s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include gdv or gev  transactions  issuance of new cards  launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
in addition  certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives 
amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on the straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements 
our estimates of each customer s performance are based on historical customer performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions legal and regulatory matters we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters 
except as described in note obligations under litigation settlements and note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report  mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects 
we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions 
through our interpretation of local tax regulations  adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we would adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained and  if so  how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained  this would decrease or increase earnings in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations 
we consider business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions asset impairment analyses prepaid customer and merchant incentives we prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives 
in the event of customer or merchant business failure  these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business 
impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customer s future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement 
our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance  discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future 
if events or changes in circumstances occur  additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred 
the carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was million at december  goodwill and intangible assets excluding capitalized software we perform analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
our goodwill policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
when performing our annual goodwill impairment test  we utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
in performing the qualitative assessment  we consider relevant events and conditions  including but not limited to  macroeconomic trends  industry and market conditions  overall financial performance  cost factors  company specific events  and fair value history 
when reviewing intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment  we exercise significant judgment using internally generated data to estimate future cash flows 
if market conditions or business conditions change in the future  we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets 
the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  excluding capitalized software  was billion  including million of unamortizable customer relationships  as of december we determined that the majority of our customer relationships  which are intangible assets  have indefinite lives 
in addition to the impairment testing noted above  we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually 
we use internal data and estimates regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value 
if a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate  it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a reduction of future net income 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended 
current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable  even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors 
the new accounting standard eliminates i the residual method of revenue allocation and ii the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
the company adopted the revised accounting standard effective january  via prospective adoption

in may  the fair value accounting standard was amended to change fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the key changes in measurement principles include limiting the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise to nonfinancial assets  providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement  and aligning the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entity s shareholders equity with the guidance for liabilities 
disclosures will be required for all transfers between levels and within the valuation hierarchy  the use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use  the level in the valuation hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed  and for level measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used  and qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements

the disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted this accounting standard on january   and the adoption did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
comprehensive income in june  a new accounting standard was issued that amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income 
also  items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements 
in december  a new accounting standard was issued that indefinitely defers the effective date for the requirement to present the reclassification of items from comprehensive income to net income 
both standards require retrospective application  and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted
