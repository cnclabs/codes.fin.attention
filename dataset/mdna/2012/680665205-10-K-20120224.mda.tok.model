item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state  and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
at december  and  our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of million and million  respectively 
these liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation 
based on our analysis  and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations in the near term

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our manufacturing operations are concentrated in two business segments chlor alkali products and winchester 
both are capital intensive manufacturing businesses 
chlor alkali operating rates are closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year sunbelt acquisition on february   we acquired polyone s interest in sunbelt for million in cash plus the assumption of a polyone guarantee related to the sunbelt notes 
with this acquisition  olin now owns of sunbelt 
the sunbelt chlor alkali plant  which is located within our mcintosh  al facility  has approximately  tons of membrane technology capacity 
we also agreed to a three year earn out  which has no guaranteed minimum or maximum  based on the performance of sunbelt 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we consolidated the sunbelt notes with a fair value of million for the remaining principal balance of million as of february  since february   our consolidated results included million of sunbelt sales and million of additional sunbelt pretax income million included in chlor alkali products segment income  less million of acquisition costs  million of interest expense and million of expense for our earn out liability on the interest we acquired 
finally  the results included a one time pretax  non cash gain of million associated with the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in sunbelt 
in conjunction with this remeasurement  a discrete deferred tax expense of million was recorded 
restructurings on december   our board of directors approved a plan to eliminate our use of mercury in the manufacture of chlor alkali products 
under the plan  the  tons of mercury cell capacity at our charleston  tn facility will be converted to  tons of membrane capacity capable of producing both potassium hydroxide and caustic soda 
the project has an estimated capital cost of approximately million 
the board of directors also approved a plan to reconfigure our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  while discontinuing chlor alkali manufacturing at this site 
this action will reduce our chlor alkali manufacturing capacity by  tons 
we based our decision to convert and reconfigure on several factors 
first  during and we had experienced a steady increase in the number of customers unwilling to accept our products manufactured using mercury cell technology 
second  there was federal legislation passed in governing the treatment of mercury that significantly limits our recycling options after december  we concluded that exiting mercury cell technology production after represented an unacceptable future cost risk 
further  the conversion of the charleston  tn plant to membrane technology will reduce the electricity usage per ecu produced by approximately and the configuration of the new plant will result in an increase in our capacity to produce potassium hydroxide 
the decision to reconfigure the augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda removes the highest cost production capacity from our system 
we currently expect to complete the conversion and reconfiguration by the end of on november   we announced that we had made the decision to relocate the winchester centerfire pistol and rifle ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
this relocation  when completed  is forecast to reduce winchester s annual operating costs by approximately million 
consistent with this relocation decision we have initiated an estimated million five year project  which includes approximately million of capital spending 
the state of mississippi and local governments have provided incentives which should offset approximately percent of the capital spending 
in october  we opened the new centerfire production facility in oxford  ms and the pistol ammunition manufacturing equipment is in the process of being relocated and started up in oxford  ms 
during  approximately of winchester s pistol ammunition was manufactured in oxford  ms 
we currently expect to complete this relocation by the end of once completed  winchester expects to have the most modern centerfire ammunition production facility in north america 
our total restructuring charges for and related to these actions were million and million  respectively 
the restructuring charges included write off of equipment and facility costs  acceleration of asset retirement obligations  employee severance and related benefit costs  non cash pension and other postretirement benefits curtailment charges  lease and other contract termination costs  employee relocation costs  and facility exit costs 
we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring charges associated with these actions through the end of other highlights in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  which more than doubled compared with the prior year 
chlor alkali products segment income included million of additional income from the acquisition of the remaining interest in sunbelt 
chlor alkali products also realized improved ecu prices for compared to the prior year 
operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
the combination of planned multi month outages by two chlorine customers and a weakening of chlorine demand negatively impacted shipment volumes in our ecu netbacks of approximately were higher than the netbacks of approximately the sunbelt ecu netback was approximately in the first quarter of  three caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
in march  we also announced a per ton chlorine price increase 
in the third quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced for per ton  which replaced a late second quarter announced caustic soda price increase of per ton 
finally  in the fourth quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced for per ton 
the fourth quarter ecu netback was approximately  which was the first decline in price since the low point in our system in the third quarter of ecu netbacks in the fourth quarter declined slightly from the third quarter levels of approximately as chlorine prices weakened  driven by a reduced level of chlorine demand  which more than offset increases in caustic soda prices 
ecu netbacks in the first quarter of are forecast to decline slightly from the fourth quarter of as we expect the fourth quarter chlorine and caustic soda pricing trends to continue into the first quarter of while the success of the third quarter per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  the majority of the benefits of this price increase  if realized  would impact our system in the first quarter of while the success of the fourth quarter per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  we believe that it is unlikely that any benefit of this price increase will be realized in the first quarter of winchester segment income was million in compared to million in the winchester segment income has declined from the surge levels of and  however  represented the third most profitable year in at least the last two decades 
the decrease in compared to the prior year reflected the impact of higher commodity metals and other material costs  higher manufacturing costs and incremental costs associated with our ongoing relocation of the centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations to oxford  ms  partially offset by higher selling prices 
other operating income for included a gain of million on the sale of a former manufacturing site and million of insurance recoveries related to our oxford  ms and st 
gabriel  la facilities 
income before taxes for and included million and million  respectively  of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense for included million of adjustments associated with a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in state tax effective rates  the expiration of statutes of limitation in federal and state jurisdictions  and the finalization of our domestic and canadian income tax returns 
income tax expense for also included a discrete deferred tax expense of million related to the tax effect of the gain recorded on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in sunbelt 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and a reduction in expense related to the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset generated by our canadian operations 
in december  we repaid the million senior notes notes issued in  and million due under the annual requirements of the sunbelt notes 
these were redeemed using cash 
also during december  we drew the remaining million of variable rate go zone bonds that were issued in the associated cash was classified as a restricted long term asset 
on december   there was a million restricted cash balance that is required to be used to fund capital projects in alabama  mississippi  and tennessee 
capital spending of million for included million for our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations and million for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology 
the capital spending for the ongoing winchester relocation of million was partially financed by million of grants received by the state of mississippi and local governments 
the full amounts of these grants were received in the charleston  tn mercury cell conversion is expected to be completed in the second half of the capital spending also included approximately million for the construction of low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv  and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites 
we expect to complete the first low salt  high strength bleach facility at mcintosh  al in the first quarter of the two remaining low salt  high strength bleach facilities are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of these three new facilities will increase total bleach manufacturing capacity by an additional over the capacity 
these low salt  high strength bleach facilities will double the concentration of the bleach we manufacture  which should significantly reduce transportation costs 
year in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  a decrease of compared with chlor alkali products began to experience improved chlorine and caustic soda demand during and experienced a record level of bleach sales 
volumes for chlorine and caustic soda improved compared to  while volumes for bleach improved 
operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
our ecu netbacks of approximately were lower than the netbacks of approximately  however  the pricing trend was positive throughout as ecu netbacks increased sequentially from the low level of approximately in the third quarter of the fourth quarter of ecu netback was approximately as business conditions improved throughout  our quarterly chlor alkali operating rates improved year over year reaching a operating rate during the summer demand season 
a significant portion of the north american chlor alkali demand improvement came from exports of products made from chlorine  driven by the energy advantage the north american chemical producers enjoy by using natural gas as compared to crude oil 
with demand for both chlorine and caustic soda improving  price increases were announced throughout the year 
during february  an per ton caustic soda price increase was announced 
we began realizing a portion of this price increase in caustic soda in the second quarter of caustic soda demand continued to improve  and as a result  during the third quarter of  three additional caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
we began realizing the benefits from these price increases and from contracts that re set on an annual basis in the first half of winchester segment income of million in  which represented the second highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades  declined compared to segment income of million 
the higher than normal levels of commercial demand that began in the fourth quarter of continued through the second quarter of beginning with the third quarter of  winchester began to experience a decline in commercial demand from the levels 
however  the second half of commercial demand remained stronger than levels 
commercial volumes  excluding rimfire  for decreased approximately from levels 
income before taxes for included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
for  income before taxes included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and a reduction in expense related to the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset generated by our canadian operations 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and reductions in expense associated with the finalization of the income tax returns 
in september  we redeemed industrial development and environmental improvement tax exempt bonds industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with maturity dates of february and march we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october in october  we completed a financing of go zone and recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due we had the option to borrow up to the entire million in a series of draw downs through december  during  we drew million of these bonds 
the proceeds from these bonds are required to be used to fund capital project spending at our mcintosh  al facility 
in december  we completed a financing of recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due in and during  we drew the entire million of the bonds 
the proceeds from the bonds are required to be used to fund the charleston  tn facility mercury cell conversion and our ongoing winchester relocation 
of the million drawn from the go zone and recovery zone bonds as of december   million of the associated cash was classified as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash  until such time as we could request reimbursement of qualifying amounts used to fund the capital projects in alabama  mississippi and tennessee 
the patient protection and affordable healthcare act was signed into law on march  and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of was signed into law on march  collectively the healthcare acts 
the impact of the healthcare acts did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and year in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  a decline of compared with chlor alkali products continued to experience the weak product demand that began in the fourth quarter of volumes for chlorine and caustic soda decreased compared to volumes for bleach  which accounted for approximately of chlor alkali products sales  increased compared to operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
these operating rates assume that of our demonstrated capacity was available for use 
the capacity of our st 
gabriel  la facility had been shutdown since late november and the facility was not available for use until the conversion and expansion project was completed in the fourth quarter of in addition  in response to low levels of customer demand for chlorine and caustic soda  an additional of our chlorine and caustic soda capacity was idled by us in after taking these capacity reduction actions into consideration  our effective operating rate for was 
our ecu netbacks of approximately were lower than the netbacks of approximately  reflecting the changes in the pricing dynamics in north america 
during  north american demand for caustic soda was strong  while supply continued to be constrained by the weakness in chlorine demand 
this resulted in a significant supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america  which resulted in record caustic soda pricing 
the result was a record ecu netback  in our system  in the first quarter of of approximately beginning late in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  demand for caustic soda weakened significantly  and fell below the demand for chlorine 
this created excess supply in north america  which caused caustic soda prices to fall 
the over supply of caustic soda caused industry operating rates to be constrained  which resulted in chlorine price increase announcements of per ton during the second quarter of caustic soda prices declined precipitously in the second quarter of and these declines continued into the third quarter of during the third quarter of  chlorine and caustic soda demand became more balanced eliminating the oversupply of caustic soda 
we began realizing increases in chlorine prices in the third quarter of with most of the improvement in the fourth quarter of ecu netbacks  in our system  bottomed out in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  as caustic soda demand improved  chlorine production declined due to seasonally weaker demand 
this resulted in a supply and demand imbalance for caustic soda in north america 
as a result of this imbalance  in december  a per ton caustic soda price increase was announced 
we began realizing the benefits of this price increase in caustic soda in the first half of winchester segment income of million in  which represented the highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades  improved compared to segment income of million 
winchester continued to experience the above normal levels of demand during that began around the november presidential election 
the increase in demand was across the majority of winchester s product offerings  including rifle  pistol and rimfire ammunition 
on a volume basis  winchester s unit shipments increased in compared to  which was driven by the higher level of commercial sales 
winchester s results reflected the impact of increased volumes and higher selling prices  and lower commodity and other material costs 
income from continuing operations before taxes for included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
on august   we sold million of senior notes notes with a maturity date of august  the notes were issued at of par value  providing a yield to maturity to investors of 
interest is paid semi annually in arrears on each february and august proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from the notes were used to further strengthen our long term liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a conversion and expansion project at our st 
gabriel  la facility and initiated production 
this project increased capacity at this location from  ecus to  ecus and significantly reduced the site s manufacturing costs 
our capital spending included million and million for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project in and  respectively 
chlor alkali products pricing in accordance with industry practice  we calculate chlor alkali products prices on an ecu netback basis  reporting and analyzing prices net of the cost of transporting the products to customers to allow for a comparable means of price comparisons between periods and with respect to our competitors 
for purposes of determining our ecu netback  we use prices that we realize as a result of sales of chlorine and caustic soda to our customers  and we do not include the value of chlorine and caustic soda that is incorporated in other products that we manufacture and sell 
quarterly and annual average ecu netbacks  excluding sunbelt  for   and were as follows first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter annual average beginning late in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  demand for caustic soda weakened significantly  and fell below the demand for chlorine

outlook net income in the first quarter of is projected to be in the to per diluted share range 
in chlor alkali products  the first quarter of segment earnings are expected to increase compared to both the fourth quarter of earnings of million and the first quarter of earnings of million 
the expected improved segment earnings compared to the first quarter of anticipates higher ecu netbacks and a full quarter of ownership of sunbelt 
the expected improved earnings compared to the fourth quarter of anticipates higher chlorine and caustic soda shipment volumes 
the chlor alkali products operating rate in the first quarter of is forecast to be in the range  which is an improvement from the fourth quarter of level of and comparable to the first quarter of level of 
ecu netbacks in the fourth quarter of approximately declined slightly from the third quarter level of approximately  as chlorine price declines more than offset increases in caustic soda prices 
ecu netbacks in the first quarter of are forecast to decline slightly from the fourth quarter of as we expect the fourth quarter chlorine and caustic soda pricing trends to continue into the first quarter of while the success of the third quarter per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  the majority of the benefits of this price increase  if realized  would impact our system in the first quarter of while the success of the fourth quarter per ton caustic soda price increase is not yet known  we believe that it is unlikely that any benefit of this price increase will be realized in the first quarter of winchester first quarter segment earnings are expected to be comparable with the first quarter of segment earnings of million 
higher commodity costs and lower levels of commercial demand compared to the first quarter of are expected to offset higher selling prices 
winchester s acquired cost of all commodity metals increased compared to levels 
the purchase price of copper increased  the price of lead increased and the price of zinc increased 
winchester utilizes approximately three times as much lead as copper and three times as much copper as zinc 
as we look forward into  the price of commodity metals will likely continue to present a significant challenge 
during  winchester was awarded the us army s second source ammunition contract  which has the potential to generate million of sales over five years 
the contract provides for the production of 
caliber  millimeter  and millimeter ammunition 
as a result of this contract  winchester anticipates that sales to military customers will increase in compared to  while sales to law enforcement customers are expected to decline in from due to state and local government budget pressures 
in january  winchester announced it had formed a joint venture named us munitions with bae systems to submit a proposal for the operation and maintenance of the lake city army ammunition plant 
the lake city army ammunition plant is the us army s primary manufacturing location for small caliber ammunition 
we believe us munitions provides the best opportunity for winchester to participate in the lake city competition 
it is expected that a decision by the us army will be made during the fourth quarter of and that after a one year transition period  the selected contractor will assume responsibility for the plant on october  this represents a long term opportunity for winchester 
we anticipate that charges for environmental investigatory and remedial activities will be in the million range  which is comparable with the level of million  before the recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods are considered 
we do not believe that there will be additional recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods in we expect defined benefit pension plan income in to be similar to the level 
based on the december  funding status  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan in we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made contributions of million and million in and  respectively  and we anticipate cash contributions of less than million in during the first quarter of  we are anticipating pretax restructuring charges of approximately million primarily associated with our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms and exiting the use of mercury cell technology in the chlor alkali manufacturing process by the end of we are expecting total pretax restructuring charges for related to these projects to be approximately million 
we expect to incur restructuring charges through totaling approximately million related to our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
we also expect to incur restructuring charges through totaling approximately million related to exiting the use of mercury cell technology in the chlor alkali manufacturing process 
we believe the effective tax rate will be in the to range 
in  we expect capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology  the low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv  and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites  the reconfiguration of our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  and our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
we anticipate the start up of the converted charleston  tn chlor alkali facility in the second half of we expect to complete the first low salt  high strength bleach facility at mcintosh  al in the first quarter of the two remaining low salt  high strength bleach facilities are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of these three new facilities will increase total bleach manufacturing capacity by an additional over the capacity 
these low salt  high strength bleach facilities will double the concentration of the bleach we manufacture  which should significantly reduce transportation costs 
we expect depreciation expense to be approximately million 
environmental matters years ended december  cash outlays receipts in millions remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays receipts our liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows december  in millions beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending currency translation adjustments ending balance total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to  primarily driven by remedial and investigatory spending due to the implementation of a remedial action plan at a former waste disposal site in  partially offset by increased recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to due to the lower recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
remedial and investigatory spending was lower in than due to completing a remedial action at a site in and principally completing an investigation at a former manufacturing site in total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  approximately million on capital projects and approximately million on normal plant operations 
remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be higher in than due to the ongoing remedial actions at a former waste disposal site and the implementation of remedial actions at another former manufacturing site 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
in the united states  the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
our canadian facility is governed by federal environmental laws administered by environment canada and by provincial environmental laws enforced by administrative agencies 
many of these laws are comparable to the us laws described above 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in  and and may be material to operating results in future years 
environmental provisions charged credited to income  which are included in cost of goods sold  were as follows years ended december  in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total environmental expense income these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our total estimated environmental liability at the end of  was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for of our environmental liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at one of these ten sites  a remedial action plan is being implemented 
at five of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at one of these ten sites  a remedial investigation is being performed 
at one site  part of the site is subject to a remedial action plan and part of the site to long term om m 
the two remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the ten largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million  respectively  were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
our environmental liability amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related cash outlays  there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps  our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
at december  and  our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of million and million  respectively 
these liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation 
based on our analysis  and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations in the near term 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of asc contingencies asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  cash flow from operations  and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as the vinyls  urethanes  bleach  ammunition and pulp and paper 
the seasonality of the ammunition business  which is typically driven by the fall hunting season  and the seasonality of the vinyls and bleach businesses  which are stronger in periods of warmer weather  typically cause working capital to fluctuate between million to million over the course of the year 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic soda  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings and cash flow 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity

the cash from operations was also impacted by a million increase in cash tax payments 
in  we made cash contributions to our canadian qualified defined benefit pension plan of million compared with million in capital spending was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
capital spending for included million for our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations and million for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology 
the capital spending for the ongoing winchester relocation was partially financed by million of grants provided by the state of mississippi and local governments 
the full amounts of these grants were received in the capital spending also included approximately million for the construction of low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv  and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites 
capital spending in included bleach manufacturing and bleach shipping by railroad expansion projects at three of our chlor alkali facilities 
capital spending in included million for the st 
gabriel  la facility conversion and expansion project and also increased investments in our bleach operations 
capital spending was   and of depreciation in  and  respectively 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology  the low salt  high strength bleach facilities  the reconfiguration of our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  and our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
we anticipate the start up of the converted charleston  tn chlor alkali facility in the second half of we expect to complete the first low salt  high strength bleach facility at mcintosh  al in the first quarter of the two remaining low salt  high strength bleach facilities are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of these three new facilities will increase total bleach manufacturing capacity by an additional over the capacity 
these low salt  high strength bleach facilities will double the concentration of the bleach we manufacture  which should significantly reduce transportation costs 
the overall use of cash of million in primarily reflects the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in sunbelt and the debt repayments in december based on our december  unrestricted cash balance of million  the restricted cash balance of million  and the availability of approximately million of liquidity from our senior revolving credit facility  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term and long term needs 
additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
on july   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million shares of common stock that will terminate in three years for any remaining shares not yet repurchased 
since the date of authorization  million shares were purchased and retired under this program at a cost of million 
as of december   we had purchased a total of million shares under this program and million shares remained authorized to be purchased 
the repurchases will be effected from time to time on the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions 
pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated december   sunbelt sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december beginning on december  and each year through  sunbelt is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes and of which million is attributable to the series g notes 
in conjunction with the sunbelt acquisition  we consolidated the sunbelt notes with a fair value of million for the remaining principal balance of million as of february  in december  million was repaid on these sunbelt notes

in september  we redeemed industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with maturity dates of february and march we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october in august  we sold million of notes with a maturity date of august  the notes were issued at of par value  providing a yield to maturity to investors of 
interest is paid semi annually in arrears on each february and august proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from the notes were used to further strengthen our long term liquidity 
at december   we had million available under our million senior revolving credit facility  because we had issued million of letters of credit under a million subfacility 
the senior revolving credit facility will expire in october under the senior revolving credit facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
the actual interest rate paid on borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility is based on a pricing grid which is dependent upon the leverage ratio as calculated under the terms of the facility at the end of the prior fiscal quarter 
the facility includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows for the last four quarters 
we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of december  and  and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured 
in the future  our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows  among other factors  will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities 
as of december   there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow 
at december   we had total letters of credit of million outstanding  of which million were issued under our million senior revolving credit facility 
in addition to our senior revolving credit facility  we have two letter of credit facilities totaling million  which we reduced from million during the letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt and certain workers compensation insurance policies 
we had a million  day accounts receivable securitization facility accounts receivable facility  renewable annually for five years  which would have expired in july during the second quarter of  we terminated the accounts receivable facility 
based on the liquidity from cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility  the accounts receivable facility was no longer necessary 
there had been no borrowings under the accounts receivable facility since the accounts receivable facility provided for the sale of our eligible trade receivables to a third party conduit through a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity that was consolidated for financial statement purposes 
the accounts receivable facility contained specific covenants relating to the ability of the lender to obtain or maintain a first priority lien on the receivables

we have entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparties to these agreements are citibank  na citibank million and wells fargo  na wells fargo million 
we have designated the swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings 
accordingly  the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of million and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of related debt 
no gain or loss has been recorded as the contracts met the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting treatment with no ineffectiveness 
commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility are an additional source of liquidity

we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is also citibank 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in october  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting

we have registered an undetermined amount of securities with the sec  so that  from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock and associated warrants in the public market under that registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease commitments are primarily for railroad cars but also include distribution  warehousing and office space and data processing and office equipment 
virtually none of our lease agreements contain escalation clauses or step rent provisions

in conjunction with the st 
gabriel  la conversion and expansion project  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a twenty year brine and pipeline supply agreement with petrologistics olefins  llc petrologistics 
petrologistics installed  owns and operates  at its own expense  a pipeline supplying brine to the st 
gabriel  la facility 
beginning november  we are obligated to make a fixed annual payment over the life of the contract of million for use of the pipeline  regardless of the amount of brine purchased 
we also have a minimum usage requirement for brine of million over the first five year period of the contract 
after the first five year period  the contract contains a buy out provision exercisable by us for million 
on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are million in this supply agreement expires in our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements a contingent tax liability qualified pension plan contributions b non qualified pension plan payments postretirement benefit payments off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases purchasing commitments raw materials capital expenditures utilities total a for the purposes of this table  we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the principal amount of any variable rate debt from the amounts outstanding on december  and that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at december  which ranged from to 
b these amounts are only estimated payments assuming an annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of  and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 
these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year 
based on the current funding requirements  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made million and million of cash contributions in and  respectively  and we anticipate less than million of cash contributions in see discussion on pension protection act of amended by the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act in pension plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the postretirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these other postretirement plans are not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  a significant adverse legal judgment  adverse cash flow trends  an adverse action or assessment by a government agency  unanticipated competition  decline in our stock price  and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
we define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment  which for our chlor alkali products segment are the us operations and canadian operations 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
we also corroborate our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market based approach that considers earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies in the chemical industry 
an impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value 
no impairment charges were recorded for  or the discount rate  profitability assumptions  terminal growth rate and cyclical nature of our chlor alkali business are the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital  which is calculated based on observable market data 
some of these data such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt are based on the market data at a point in time 
other data such as the equity risk premium are based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with a market capitalization premium added  as applicable 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events 
our analysis uses our internally generated long range plan 
our discounted cash flow analysis uses the assumptions in our long range plan about terminal growth rates  forecasted capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
the long range plan reflects management judgment  supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts 
we believe the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
however  given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit 
in all cases  the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units by a substantial amount 
we also applied a hypothetical decrease of basis points in our terminal growth rate or an increase of basis points in our weighted average cost of capital to test the fair value calculation 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units derived in these calculations also exceeded our book value by a substantial amount for each of our reporting units 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted sales or gross margins are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
environmental accruals charges to income for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations 
environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by asc  formerly sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension sfas no 
 respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
substantially all defined benefit pension plan participants are no longer accruing benefits  therefore  actuarial gains and losses are amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants 
for the years ended december  and  the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years and years  respectively 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they subsequently generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns and inflation by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the defined benefit pension plan income by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension income by million and increased the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension income by million and decreased the projected benefit obligation by million

new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu testing goodwill for impairment asu  which amends asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
this update permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test

derivative financial instruments asc derivatives and hedging asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 required an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
all derivatives recognized in earnings impact the expense line item on our consolidated statement of operations that is consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally canadian dollar and euro 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and  we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with a notional value of zero and million  respectively 
we use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  electricity  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy costs used in our manufacturing process 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized into earnings 
gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings 
gains on settled futures contracts were million million  net of taxes and million million  net of taxes in and  respectively  which were included in cost of goods sold 
losses on settled futures contracts were million  million  net of taxes in  which were included in cost of goods sold 
at december   we had open positions in futures contracts through totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a pretax loss of million 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
if commodity prices were to remain at the levels they were at december   approximately million of deferred losses  net of tax  would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months 
the actual effect on earnings will be dependent on commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a gain  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
we include the gain or loss on the hedged items fixed rate borrowings in the same line item  interest expense  as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps 
as of december  and  the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were million and million  respectively 
in march  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank 
in october  we entered into million of interest rate swaps with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is also citibank 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in october  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded currently in earnings 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  paid us fixed rates 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes

the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which was recognized through in january  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swap did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps were recorded currently in earnings 
the fair value of our derivative asset and liability balances were december  in millions other current assets other assets total derivative asset current installments of long term debt accrued liabilities other liabilities long term debt total derivative liability the ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in zero  zero and million credited to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our foreign currency forward contracts  certain commodity derivatives  and our million and million fixed and variable interest rate swaps did not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting 
the effect on operating results of items not qualifying for hedge accounting was a charge of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of certain commodities  our ongoing investing and financing activities  and our operations that use foreign currencies 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our winchester segment are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  as of december   we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
the effect of interest rates on investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations  and commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
we have entered into million of interest rate swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparties to these agreements are citibank million and wells fargo million 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the terms of the swaps are the same as the underlying debt instruments 
of the million of interest rate swaps outstanding at december   million were entered into in may on the sunbelt notes 
the counterparty to this agreement is wells fargo 
in april  citibank terminated million of interest rate swaps on our industrial revenue bonds due in the result was a gain of million  which would have been recognized through in september  the industrial revenue bonds were redeemed by us  and as a result  the remaining million gain was recognized in interest expense in in march  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank 
in october  we entered into million of interest rate swaps with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is also citibank 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in october  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded currently in earnings 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  paid us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements was citibank 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  paid us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement was bank of america  a major financial institution 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which was recognized through assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact annual interest expense by million 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  in millions olin pays floating rate  due march a  due march a  sunbelt notes may a industrial development obligation at a fixed interest rate of due march olin receives floating rate  due october a  due october a a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
