d a more detailed description and computation of adjusted ffo per share and adjusted ebitda is contained in the non gaap financial measures section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business and leisure travel increased in  while new hotel construction remained at historic low levels 
the lodging industry gained momentum to rebound to levels more consistent with long term trends following the recent recession  with improvement in both occupancy and average daily rate  or adr 
our hotels continued to grow occupancy in  but the strong demand enabled most of our growth in revenue per available room  or revpar  to come from improvement in average daily rate  or adr 
in  our revpar improved  compared to the prior year  through a increase in adr and a improvement in occupancy 
the sustained growth in adr allowed our hotels to improve their hotel ebitda margin by basis points  compared to the prior year 
in  we undertook several critical steps making significant progress toward achieving the objective of our long term strategic plan we sold nine hotels since december out of hotels initially brought to market in late for total gross proceeds of million our pro rata share was million 
we used million of those proceeds to repay indebtedness secured by four of those hotels and the remainder to repay other indebtedness 
we also completed several other balance sheet initiatives during established a million secured line of credit we had no borrowings under the line at december   and the full million is available for general corporate purposes 
issued million of senior secured notes due and used the net proceeds to repay existing higher cost debt including the remaining million of outstanding senior notes due  repay the million balance on our line of credit and fund our million purchase of royalton and morgans 
sold million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds to redeem million of face value of our senior secured notes due extended a maturing mortgage loan for up to two years 
the loan now bears an average interest rate of libor plus and is prepayable at any time  in whole or in part  with no penalty 
at the same time  we repaid million of the principal balance  reducing the outstanding balance to million 
in may  we acquired two midtown manhattan hotels  royalton and morgans 
in december  we acquired and commenced redevelopment of the four plus star knickerbocker hotel in times square 
in january  felcor reinstated its current quarterly preferred dividend and paid current quarterly preferred dividends each quarter of felcor cannot pay any common dividends unless and until all accrued and current preferred dividends are paid 
funds used by felcor to pay common or preferred dividends are provided through distributions from felcor lp 
felcor s board of directors will determine whether and when to declare future dividends including the accrued but unpaid preferred dividends based upon various factors  including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as minimum reit distribution requirements 
financial comparison loss from continuing operations in millions year ended december  change change revpar hotel ebitda a hotel ebitda margin a loss from continuing operations b a hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures 
a discussion of the use  limitations and importance of these non gaap financial measures and detailed reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are found elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section non gaap financial measures 
b the following amounts are included in loss from continuing operations in millions year ended december  impairment loss impairment loss on unconsolidated hotels debt extinguishment results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss compared to a million loss in our loss included million of impairment charges million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations and million of losses from extinguishment of debt million in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations  partially offset by million of gains from hotel dispositions in discontinued operations 
our loss included million of impairment charges million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations partially offset by million of gains from extinguishment of debt million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  and a million gain related to the sale of our equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities 
in total revenue was million  a increase compared to the increase principally reflects a increase in same store revpar at our core hotels and at our non strategic hotels  which was driven by a increase in adr and a increase in occupancy  as well as million in incremental revenue from our recently acquired hotels the fairmont copley plaza  acquired in august  and royalton and morgans  acquired in may 
hotel departmental expenses increased million  compared to  reflecting improved occupancy and million of incremental hotel departmental expense from our recently acquired hotels 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to this change is primarily due to the mix and nature of the business at the fairmont copley plaza  which has significant food and beverage revenue 
food and beverage expenses are generally much higher as a percent of revenue than room expenses 
other property related costs increased million  due to a combination of improved occupancy and million of incremental other property related costs from our recently acquired hotels 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs remained essentially unchanged  compared to management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  due to higher revenues which serve as the basis for determining such fees and  in fees with respect of our recently acquired hotels 
as a percent of total revenue  management and franchise fees remained essentially unchanged  compared to taxes  insurance and lease expenses increased million compared to as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense improved from in to in this trend reflects favorable property tax settlements and improved liability claims experience  and was partially offset by million of incremental expenses at our recently acquired hotels 
corporate expenses decreased million and decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the decrease in corporate bonus expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  compared to the same period in our asset values  the basis from which we calculate depreciation  declined between and as result of hotel sales and impairment charges 
our same store depreciation expense declined from to  but this decline was offset by million of depreciation expense related to our recently acquired hotels 
as a percent of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to in compared to for the same period in impairment charges 
from  we identified hotels included in our consolidated investment in hotels as non strategic 
we recorded million of incremental impairment charges in relating to two of these non strategic hotels that we are currently marketing for sale 
the charges were based on revised estimated fair values obtained through the marketing process that were lower than the net book values for these hotels 
we recorded million of impairment charges from continuing operations in  relating to of the non strategic hotels of the hotels identified as non strategic remain in continuing operations 
net interest expense decreased million compared to the same period in  primarily reflecting our lower average debt 
extinguishment of debt 
during  we redeemed million of our senior notes due in october and recognized a million debt extinguishment charge related to prepayment premium and the write off of a pro rata portion of the debt discount and deferred loan costs  all of which was partially offset by a million extinguishment gain when we refinanced a separate mortgage loan 
in june  we repaid million of debt  secured by two hotels  for million  and recorded a related million gain on extinguishment of debt 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities was a loss of million compared to million of income in in  we had a million gain from the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity which owned the sheraton premiere hotel in tysons corner  virginia 
discontinued operations consists of eight hotels sold in  one hotel sold in  and two hotels transferred to a lender in satisfaction of debt in in  we recorded million of gains from the sale of hotels and million of impairment charges 
in  we recorded impairment charges on discontinued hotels of i million related to our decision to sell hotels included in our consolidated investment in hotels of these hotels are in discontinued operations  of which were impaired in and ii million related to our decision to return two hotels to their respective lenders in full satisfaction of the related debt 
these charges were partially offset by a million gain from debt extinguishment related to the two hotels transferred to lenders in satisfaction of debt 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss compared to a million loss in our loss included million of impairment charges million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  partially offset by million of gains from extinguishment of debt million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  and a million gain related to the sale of our equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities 
our loss included a million impairment charge and a  gain from disposition both in discontinued operations  as well as a million loss from debt extinguishment in continuing operations 
in total revenue was million  a increase compared to the increase principally reflects a increase in same store revpar  which was driven by a increase in occupancy partially offset by a decrease in adr 
the fairmont copley plaza  which we acquired in august  contributed million 
hotel departmental expenses increased million compared to  reflecting improved occupancy and million of expenses at the fairmont copley plaza 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to this change is primarily due to the mix and nature of the business at the fairmont copley plaza  which has significant food and beverage revenue 
food and beverage expenses are generally much higher as a percent of revenue than room expenses 
other property related costs increased million  reflecting improved occupancy and million of costs from the fairmont copley plaza 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs remained essentially unchanged  compared to management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  due to higher revenues which serve as the basis for determining such fees and  in fees with respect of the fairmont copley plaza 
as a percent of total revenue  management and franchise fees remained essentially unchanged  compared to taxes  insurance and lease expenses increased million compared to the fairmont copley plaza added million of taxes  insurance and lease expense in as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense decreased from in to in  reflecting improved property insurance costs and changes in franchise tax filing status 
corporate expenses increased million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this increase primarily reflects a temporary change in our long term compensation program and increased corporate bonus accruals 
because of the impact of the recession on the trading price of our common stock  our board of directors determined that issuing restricted stock at exceptionally low trading prices would be unduly dilutive to our stockholders 
in lieu of issuing restricted stock  restricted cash with which grantees could and did purchase stock  was granted 
because those grants were subject to payroll tax withholding  amounts withheld were recognized as an expense in the first quarter of  rather than expensed over the normal three year vesting period 
the increase in bonus expense is attributed to a higher bonus earned  based on the actual performance and the structure of our incentive compensation plan  compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased million  compared to  primarily attributable to depreciation on million and million of consolidated hotel capital assets placed in service in and  respectively 
impairment charge 
during  we identified hotels included in our consolidated investment in hotels as non strategic 
related to this decision  we recorded million of impairment charges from continuing operations in  relating to of these hotels of the hotels identified as non strategic in remain in continuing operations 
net interest expense increased million compared to  largely attributable to our senior notes  which were issued in october these notes bear interest at a higher rate than the notes they refinanced 
debt extinguishment 
we repaid million of secured debt for million and recorded a corresponding million gain on extinguishment of debt 
this gain was partially offset by losses from retirement of million of our senior notes due june in  we retired million of senior notes maturing in and terminated our line of credit 
we incurred a million charge associated with these transactions 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities was million compared to a million loss in in  we had a million gain from the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity which owned the sheraton premiere hotel in tysons corner  virginia 
discontinued operations primarily reflects a million impairment charge and million gain from debt extinguishment related to five sold hotels and two hotels transferred to lenders in full satisfaction of the related debt in discontinued operations in primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gains on sale resulting from a change in the federal tax law that allowed recovery of previously paid alternative minimum taxes on gains from hotel sales in and  ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss and a  loss on sale primarily related to selling costs  and iii million of operating losses and interest expense related to hotels placed in discontinued operations in  and non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report to certain non gaap financial measures 
these measures  including ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following tables reconcile these non gaap measures to felcor s most comparable gaap financial measure 
immediately following the reconciliations  we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and of the limitations upon such measures 
the following tables detail our computation of ffo and adjusted ffo in thousands  except for per share data reconciliation of net loss to ffo and adjusted ffo in thousands  except per share data year ended december  dollars shares per share amount dollars shares per share amount dollars shares per share amount net loss noncontrolling interests preferred dividends numerator for basic and diluted loss attributable to common stockholders depreciation and amortization depreciation  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities gain on involuntary conversion impairment loss impairment loss  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities gain on sale of hotels gain on sale of unconsolidated entities noncontrolling interests in felcor lp unvested restricted stock ffo acquisition costs extinguishment of debt conversion costs severance costs lease termination costs unvested restricted stock adjusted ffo reconciliation of net income loss to ffo and adjusted ffo in thousands  except per share data year ended december  dollars shares per share amount dollars shares per share amount net income loss noncontrolling interests preferred dividends net income loss attributable to felcor common stockholders less dividends declared on unvested restricted stock numerator for basic and diluted loss attributable to common stockholders depreciation and amortization depreciation  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities gain on involuntary conversion impairment loss impairment loss  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities gain on sale of hotels gain on sale of unconsolidated entities noncontrolling interests in felcor lp dividends declared on unvested restricted stock unvested restricted stock ffo extinguishment of debt hurricane loss hurricane loss  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities conversion costs severance costs liquidated damages  discontinued operations abandoned projects adjusted ffo the following table details our computation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in thousands reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda in thousands year ended december  net income loss depreciation and amortization depreciation  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities interest expense interest expense  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities amortization of stock compensation noncontrolling interests in other partnerships ebitda impairment loss impairment loss  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities hurricane loss hurricane loss  discontinued operations and unconsolidated entities extinguishment of debt conversion costs acquisition costs severance costs liquidated damages  discontinued operations lease termination costs abandoned projects gain on sale of hotels gain on involuntary conversion gain on sale of unconsolidated entities adjusted ebitda the following tables detail our computation of hotel ebitda  hotel ebitda margin  same store operating revenue and expenses  and includes the reconciliation of same store operating revenue and same store operating expense to total revenue  total operating expense and operating loss at the dates presented

b consolidated hotel lease expense represents the percentage lease expense of our owned operating lessees 
the offsetting percentage lease revenue is included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities 
substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a hotel reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income loss attributable to felcor as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 
ffo for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
adjustments to ffo and ebitda we adjust ffo and ebitda when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items  including but not limited to those described below  provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ffo  and adjusted ebitda when combined with gaap net income attributable to felcor  ebitda and ffo  is beneficial to an investor s better understanding of our operating performance 
gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps we exclude gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps from ffo and ebitda because we believe that it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance of our hotel assets 
this also represents an acceleration of interest expense or a reduction of interest expense  and interest expense is excluded from ebitda 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle infrequently  the financial accounting standards board promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we exclude these one time adjustments in computing adjusted ffo and adjusted ebitda because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period 
in addition  to derive adjusted ebitda we exclude gains or losses on the sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses because we believe that including them in ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
additionally  the gain or loss on sale of depreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods  and depreciation is excluded from ebitda 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and brand managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures that we use in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating all revenues and expenses from continuing operations not directly associated with hotel operations  including corporate level expenses  depreciation and amortization  and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by noncontrolling interests and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margins are presented on a same store basis and exclude the historical results of operations from the fairmont copley plaza acquired in august use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
these non gaap financial measures as presented by us  may not be comparable to non gaap financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
these non gaap financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   we generated million of cash provided by operating activities primarily from hotel operations  a million decline compared to this decline primarily reflects payment of million of liquidated damages in in respect of our sale of two hotels and the payment of bonuses earned in at december   we had million of cash  including approximately million held under management agreements to meet working capital needs 
the combination of increased lodging demand and very limited new hotel construction provided momentum to maintain occupancy growth and boost adr in while we saw growth in occupancy in  most of our growth came from improved adr 
we expect continued growth in adr and revpar in we expect our revpar will increase from to compared to  which assumes continued occupancy and adr growth 
we expect million to million of cash from operating activities 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
some of these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which lends volatility to our operating results 
we have implemented extensive cost containment initiatives at our hotels  including reducing headcount and improving productivity and energy efficiency 
if revpar decreases  or fails to grow in line with or better than occupancy  and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
investing activities during  cash used in investing activities increased million compared to  due primarily to our acquisition of royalton  morgans and the knickerbocker  partially offset by proceeds from hotel sales 
in  we completed approximately million of capital improvements at our consolidated hotels primarily for renovations at eight hotels and redevelopment at two hotels 
as part of our long term capital plan  we anticipate renovating between six and eight core hotels each year 
in  we expect to start renovations at three hotels 
we expect to spend approximately million for renovation and redevelopment capital in which payments will be funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our line of credit 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million at the knickerbocker  which will be funded primarily by restricted cash 
financing activities for  cash provided by financing activities increased by million compared to  due primarily to issuance of our senior notes  which was partially offset by retirement of million of debt in and payment of current quarterly preferred dividends 
we expect to pay approximately million in normally occurring principal payments  and million in current quarterly preferred dividends in  which payments will be funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
in january  felcor reinstated its current quarterly preferred dividend and paid current quarterly preferred dividends in each quarter of felcor cannot pay any common dividends unless and until all accrued and current preferred dividends are paid 
funds used by felcor to pay common or preferred dividends are provided through distributions from felcor lp 
felcor s board of directors will determine whether and when to declare future dividends including the accrued but unpaid preferred dividends based upon various factors  including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as minimum reit distribution requirements 
we had million of aggregate accrued dividends payable to holders of our series a and series c preferred stock at december  including million pertaining to the current quarter 
common stock offering 
in april  felcor sold million shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the net proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discounts  were approximately million and were contributed to felcor lp in exchange for a like number of units 
we used these proceeds to repay million by face value of our senior secured notes due line of credit 
in march  we established a million secured line of credit 
at the same time  we repaid a million secured loan and a million secured loan  with a combination of million of cash on hand and funds drawn under the new line of credit all of which has been subsequently been repaid 
the repaid loans would have matured in and including extensions  respectively  and were secured by mortgages on hotels 
those same hotels secure repayment of amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
the credit facility bears interest at libor  plus  with no libor floor 
secured debt 
at december   we had a total of billion of consolidated secured debt with encumbered consolidated hotels with a billion aggregate net book value 
in may  we repaid million in secured loans when we sold the mortgaged hotels 
in june  we repaid at maturity a million loan that was secured by one hotel 
in june  we obtained a million loan to refinance a loan secured by one hotel 
the old loan balance was million and by the terms of the old loan  upon refinancing  million of the old loan was forgiven 
we recognized a million net gain from extinguishment of debt in connection with the refinancing 
in july  we repaid the new loan in full and recognized a  charge from extinguishment at that time 
in july  we repaid million in secured loans when we sold the mortgaged hotels 
in october  we modified the term of a cmbs mortgage loan scheduled to mature in november  extending its maturity for up to two years 
the loan now bears an average interest rate at libor plus and is prepayable at any time  in whole or in part  with no penalty 
in conjunction with the modification  we repaid million of the principal balance  reducing the outstanding balance to million at that time 
except in the case of our senior notes  our mortgage debt is generally recourse solely to the specific hotels securing the debt except in case of fraud  misapplication of funds and certain other limited recourse carve out provisions  which could extend recourse to us 
much of our secured debt allows us to substitute collateral under certain conditions and is prepayable  subject in some instances to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
much of our secured debt other than our senior notes includes lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
we are permitted to spend an amount required to cover our budgeted hotel operating expenses  taxes  debt service  insurance and capital expenditure reserves even if revenues are flowing through a lock box in cases where a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
with the exception of loans secured by two hotels  all of our consolidated loans subject to lock box provisions currently exceed the applicable minimum debt service coverage ratios 
senior notes 
we previously issued million of our senior secured notes due  of which million were outstanding at december  in addition  in may  we issued million of senior secured notes due and used the net proceeds to repay existing higher cost debt including the remaining million of our outstanding senior notes due and fund our purchase of royalton and morgans 
our senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage thresholds in order to i incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  ii pay dividends in excess of the minimum distributions required to meet the reit qualification test  iii repurchase capital stock  or iv merge 
we currently exceed all minimum thresholds  other than for certain restricted payments 
under the terms of our preferred stock  we are also prohibited from paying common dividends or repurchasing shares of common stock until our accrued preferred dividends are paid in full 
these notes are guaranteed by us  and payment of our notes is secured by a pledge of the limited partner interests in felcor lp owned by felcor 
in addition  our senior notes are secured by first lien mortgages and related security interests and or negative pledges on up to hotels for our senior notes and six for our senior notes  and pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries of felcor lp 
we repaid the remaining outstanding million of our senior notes when they matured in june in june  we redeemed million in aggregate principal of our senior notes using million of net proceeds of our recent equity offering 
under the terms of the indenture governing the redeemed notes  the redemption price was of the principal amount of the redeemed notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date 
we recognized a million debt extinguishment charge related to the prepayment premium and the write off of a pro rata portion of the related debt discount and deferred loan costs 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we entered into interest rate cap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these interest rate caps were not designated as hedges and had insignificant fair values at both december  and  resulting in no significant net earnings impact 
consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands encumbered hotels interest rate december  maturity date line of credit a l august b hotel mortgage debt mortgage debt l c april mortgage debt l may d mortgage debt april mortgage debt e june august mortgage debt july senior notes senior secured notes june senior secured notes f october other g l december retired debt total a we currently have full availability under our million line of credit 
b the line of credit can be extended for one year to  subject to satisfying certain conditions 
c libor for this loan is subject to a floor 
we purchased an interest rate cap million notional amount that caps libor at and expires may d this loan can be extended for six months  subject to satisfying certain conditions 
e the hotels securing this debt are subject to separate loan agreements and are not cross collateralized 
f these notes have million in aggregate principal outstanding million in aggregate principal amount was redeemed in june and were initially sold at a discount that provided an effective yield of before transaction costs 
g this loan is related to our knickerbocker development project and is fully secured by restricted cash and a mortgage 
because we were able to assume an existing loan when we purchased this hotel  we were not required to pay any local mortgage recording tax 
when that loan is transferred to a new lender and made part of our construction loan  we expect to only pay such tax to the extent of the incremental principal amount of the construction loan 
contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make certain future payments under debt agreements and various contracts 
the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt a operating leases purchase obligations accrued obligations on sold hotels total contractual obligations a our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures 
we own more than of the operating lessees operating of these hotels and one hotel is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss from unconsolidated entities of million  million including million of gains from sale  and million for  and  respectively 
we received distributions of million of which million came from operations  million of which million came from operations  and million of which million came from operations for  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from their operating lessees 
capital expenditures at the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to joint ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by them could perform below expectations and result in insolvency of the partnership and acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we make many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which include the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods  expected remaining useful lives of assets  estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and future capital expenditures 
we record an impairment charge when one or more of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries experiences an other than temporary decline in fair value 
any decline in fair value that is not expected to be recovered in the next months is considered other than temporary 
we record an impairment in our equity based investments as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
our estimates of fair values are based on future cash flow estimates  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our hotels or investments in unconsolidated entities  thereby requiring future impairment charges 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
in  and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of such costs 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets  and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation and amortization expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are based on purchase price and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated purchase price  if any  is treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations prepared by management and or independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources such as those obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we recorded a valuation allowance related to our trss net deferred tax asset  because of the uncertainty of realizing the asset s benefit 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   approximately of our consolidated debt had fixed interest rates 
in some cases  market rates of interest are below the rates we are obligated to pay on our fixed rate debt 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the tables present scheduled maturities before extension options and weighted average interest rates  by maturity dates
