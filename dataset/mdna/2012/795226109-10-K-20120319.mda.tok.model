item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business salisbury  a connecticut corporation  formed in  is the bank holding company for the bank  a connecticut chartered and fdic insured commercial bank headquartered in lakeville  connecticut 
salisbury s principal business consists of the business of the bank 
the bank  formed in  is engaged in customary banking activities  including general deposit taking and lending activities to both retail and commercial markets  and trust and wealth advisory services 
the bank conducts its banking business from eight full service offices in the towns of canaan  lakeville  salisbury and sharon  connecticut  south egremont and sheffield  massachusetts  and  dover plains and millerton  new york  and its trust and wealth advisory services from offices in lakeville  connecticut 
critical accounting policies and estimates salisbury s consolidated financial statements follow gaap as applied to the banking industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
salisbury s significant accounting policies are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  along with this management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating salisbury s reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet 
note describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses are included in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis 
management evaluates goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually using valuation techniques that involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment giving consideration to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  estimates of future cash flows  delinquencies and default severity  and the intent and ability of salisbury to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the consideration of the above factors is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense

the credit quality segments of loans receivable and the allowance for loan losses are as follows december  december  in thousands loans allowance loans allowance performing loans     potential problem loans   collectively evaluated    performing loans potential problem loans   impaired loans   individually evaluated     unallocated allowance totals     the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the broad categories of the loan portfolio and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions 

table of contents years ended december  dollars in thousands a allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans residential   commercial    construction  land land development home equity credit real estate secured   commercial industrial consumer municipal general unallocated total allowance   a percent of loans in each category to total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and is reduced by loan charge offs 
loan charge offs are recognized when management determines a loan or portion of a loan to be uncollectible 
the allowance for loan losses is computed by segregating the portfolio into three components loans collectively evaluated for impairment general loss allocation factors for non impaired loans are segmented into pools of loans based on similar risk characteristics such as loan product  collateral type and loan to value  loan risk rating  historical loss experience  delinquency factors and other similar economic indicators  loans individually evaluated for impairment individual loss allocations for loans deemed to be impaired based on discounted cash flows or collateral value  and unallocated general loss allocations for other environmental factors 
impaired loans and certain potential problem loans  where warranted  are individually evaluated for impairment 
impairment is measured for each individual loan  or for a borrower s aggregate loan exposure  using either the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
an allowance is established when the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the component of the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment is estimated by stratifying loans into segments and credit risk ratings and applying management s general loss allocation factors 
the general loss allocation factors are based on expected loss experience adjusted for historical loss experience and other qualitative factors  including levels trends in delinquencies  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  experience ability depth of lending management and staff  and national and local economic trends and conditions 
the qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment 
there were no significant changes in salisbury s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
it reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio 
determining the adequacy of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods  and management must make estimates using assumptions and information that are often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in management s judgment  salisbury remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans at december  management s loan risk rating assignments  loss percentages and specific reserves are subjected annually to an independent credit review by an external firm 
in addition  the bank is examined annually on a rotational process by one of its two primary regulatory agencies  the fdic and ctdob 
as an integral part of their examination process  the fdic and ctdob review the bank s credit risk ratings and allowance for loan losses 
the bank was examined by the fdic in may and by the ctdob in april

for further information on income taxes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
salisbury did not incur connecticut income tax in or  other than minimum state income tax  as a result of its utilization of connecticut tax legislation that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a pic

salisbury s income tax provision reflects the full impact of the connecticut legislation 
salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in connecticut tax law

as part of this process  salisbury considers its intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  salisbury recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
salisbury does not intend to sell any of its securities and it is not more likely than not that salisbury will be required to sell any of its securities before recovery of their cost basis  which may be maturity 
therefore  management does not consider any of its securities  other than four non agency cmo securities reflecting otti  to be otti at december  in salisbury determined that five non agency cmo securities reflected otti and recognized losses for deterioration in credit quality of  salisbury judged the four remaining securities not to have additional otti and all other cmo securities not to be otti as of december  it is possible that future loss assumptions could change necessitating salisbury to recognize future otti for further deterioration in credit quality 
salisbury does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that salisbury will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis

offsetting these deteriorations were loan risk rating upgrades resulting from improved performance  loan repayments  real estate acquired in settlement of loans and a loan restructured in whose designation as troubled debt restructured was removed due to satisfactory performance 
salisbury has cooperative relationships with the vast majority of its non performing loan customers 
substantially all non performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral 
salisbury pursues the resolution of all non performing loans through collections  restructures  voluntary liquidation of collateral by the borrower and  where necessary  legal action 
when attempts to work with a customer to return a loan to performing status  including restructuring the loan  are unsuccessful  salisbury will initiate appropriate legal action seeking to acquire property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure  or to liquidate business assets 
credit quality segments salisbury categorizes loans receivable into the following credit quality segments 
impaired loans consist of all non accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans  and represent loans for which it is probable that salisbury will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements 
non accrual loans  a sub set of impaired loans  are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued because  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is unlikely 
non performing loans consist of non accrual loans  and accruing loans past due days and over that are well collateralized  in the process of collection and where full collection of principal and interest is assured 
non performing assets consist of non performing loans plus real estate acquired in settlement of loans 

table of contents troubled debt restructured loans are loans for which concessions such as reduction of interest rates  other than normal market rate adjustments  or deferral of principal or interest payments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest  have been granted due to a borrower s financial condition 
loan restructuring is employed when management believes the granting of a concession will increase the probability of the full or partial collection of principal and interest 
potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and that are not classified as impaired 
credit risk ratings salisbury assigns credit risk ratings to loans receivable in order to manage credit risk and to determine the allowance for loan losses 
credit risk ratings categorize loans by common financial and structural characteristics that measure the credit strength of a borrower 
salisbury s rating model has eight risk rating grades  with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of default 
grades through are pass ratings and through are ratings special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss defined by the bank s regulatory agencies  the fdic and ctdob 
risk ratings are assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio and are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised  if needed  to reflect changes in the borrowers current financial position and outlook  risk profiles and the related collateral and structural positions 
loans risk rated as special mention possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loans at some future date 
loans risk rated as substandard are loans where the bank s position is clearly not protected adequately by borrower current net worth or payment capacity 
these loans have well defined weaknesses based on objective evidence and include loans where future losses to the bank may result if deficiencies are not corrected  and loans where the primary source of repayment such as income is diminished and the bank must rely on sale of collateral or other secondary sources of collection 
loans risk rated as doubtful have the same weaknesses as substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full  given current facts  conditions  and values  to be highly improbable 
the possibility of loss is high  but due to certain important and reasonably specific pending factors  which may work to strengthen the loan  its reclassification as an estimated loss is deferred until its exact status can be determined 
loans risk rated as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value  that continuance as bank assets is unwarranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather  it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless loan even though partial recovery may be made in the future 
management actively reviews and tests its credit risk ratings against actual experience and engages an independent third party to annually validate its assignment of credit risk ratings

salisbury s primary source of liquidity is deposits and though its preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low cost deposits  its ability to do so is affected by competitive interest rates and terms in its marketplace  and other financial market conditions 
other sources of funding include cash flows from loan and securities principal payments and maturities  funds provided by operations  and discretionary use of fhlbb advances 
liquidity can also be provided through sales of securities available for sale and loans 
salisbury manages its liquidity in accordance with a liquidity funding policy  and also maintains a contingency funding plan that provide for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity 
at december   salisbury s liquidity ratio  as represented by cash  short term available for sale securities and marketable assets to net deposits and short term unsecured liabilities  was  substantially unchanged from at december  management believes salisbury s funding sources will meet anticipated funding needs

the sblf program is a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of to encourage lending to small businesses by providing tier capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than billion 
the preferred stock qualifies as tier capital for regulatory purposes and ranks senior to the common stock 
the series b preferred stock pays noncumulative dividends 
the dividend rate on the series b preferred stock for the initial quarterly dividend period ended september  and each of the next nine quarterly dividend periods the series b preferred stock is outstanding is determined each quarter based on the increase in the bank s qualified small business lending

for the tenth quarterly dividend period through four and one half years after its issuance  the dividend rate on the series b preferred stock will be fixed at the rate in effect at the end of the ninth quarterly dividend period and after four and one half years from its issuance the dividend rate will be fixed at percent per annum 
on december   salisbury declared a series b preferred stock dividend of  payable on january  the series b preferred stock is non voting  other than voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the series b preferred stock 
the series b preferred stock is redeemable at any time at one hundred percent of the issue price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
simultaneously with the receipt of the sblf capital  salisbury repurchased for million all of its series a preferred stock sold to the treasury in under the cpp  a part of tarp  and made a payment for accrued dividends 
the transaction resulted in net capital proceeds to salisbury of million  of which salisbury invested million  or  in the bank as tier capital 
as part of the cpp  salisbury had issued to the treasury a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant was repurchased for  on november  and simultaneously cancelled 
capital requirements salisbury and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
under current regulatory definitions  salisbury and the bank are considered to be well capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as a result  the bank pays lower federal deposit insurance premiums than those banks that are not well capitalized 
salisbury and the bank s regulatory capital ratios are as follows well december  december  capitalized salisbury bank salisbury bank total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier risk based ratio of or above and a leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
maintaining strong capital is essential to salisbury and the bank s safety and soundness 
however  the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth  meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices 
dividends during  salisbury declared and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of per common share each quarter  totaling  the board of directors of salisbury declared a common stock dividend of per common share payable on february  to shareholders of record on february  common stock dividends  when declared  will generally be paid the last business day of february  may  august and november  although salisbury is not obligated to pay dividends on those dates or at any other time 

table of contents during  salisbury declared three and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of each totaling million 
in november  salisbury amended its dividend policy to coincide future quarterly common stock dividend declarations with quarterly earnings announcements made approximately four weeks after the end of future quarterly reporting periods 
prior to this amendment  dividend declarations were generally announced prior to the end of a reporting period 
the timing of dividend payments remained substantially unchanged 
consequently  on february  salisbury announced both its financial results for the fourth quarter of and its declaration on january  of a common stock dividend of per common share  payable on february  for the corresponding prior year period  salisbury announced a common stock dividend of per common share on november   payable on january   and announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of on march during salisbury declared preferred stock series a and series b dividends of  and  respectively  to the treasury 
salisbury s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on the bank s ability to pay cash dividends to salisbury 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends and other payments by the bank to salisbury 
under connecticut law  the bank cannot declare a cash dividend except from net profits  defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations 
the total of all cash dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year shall not  unless specifically approved by the banking commissioner  exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years 
frb supervisory letter sr  february   revised march   states that  as a general matter  the board of directors of a bank holding company bhc should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate  defer  or significantly reduce dividends if net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or the bhc will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
moreover  a bhc should inform the federal reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period eg  quarter for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bhc capital position 
salisbury believes that the payment of common stock cash dividends is appropriate  provided that such payment considers salisbury s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of salisbury or the bank 
the continued payment of common stock cash dividends by salisbury will be dependent on salisbury s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of salisbury 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on salisbury s financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices salisbury s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap that require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  over time  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of salisbury are monetary and as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on salisbury s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation  although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
although not a material factor in recent years  inflation could impact earnings in future periods 
forward looking statements this annual report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to such matters as a assumptions concerning future economic and business conditions and their effect on the economy in general and on the markets in which salisbury and the bank do business  and b expectations for revenues and earnings for salisbury and bank 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions rather than historical or current facts and  therefore  are inherently uncertain and subject to risk 
for those statements  salisbury claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation act of actual results could differ materially from management expectations  projections and estimates 
factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include  but are not limited to  the following a the risk of adverse changes in business conditions in the banking industry generally and in the specific markets in which the bank operates  b changes in the legislative and regulatory environment that negatively impacts salisbury and the bank through increased operating expenses  c increased competition from other financial and non financial institutions  d the impact of technological advances  and e other risks detailed from time to time in salisbury s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
such developments could have an adverse impact on salisbury s and the bank s financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s salisbury manages its exposure to interest rate risk through its asset liability management committee alco using risk limits and policy guidelines to manage assets and funding liabilities to produce financial results that are consistent with salisbury s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability targets 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the alco manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in salisbury s financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month horizon 
in management s december  analysis  three of the simulations incorporate management s growth assumptions over the simulation horizons  with allowances made for loan  deposit and security product mix shifts in selected interest rate scenarios  such as movements between lower rate savings and money market deposit accounts and higher rate time deposits  and changes in the reinvestment of loan and securities cash flows 
the fourth simulation incorporates management s balance sheet growth assumptions 
additionally  the simulations take into account the specific re pricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
the alco reviews the simulation results to determine whether salisbury s exposure to change in net interest income remains within established tolerance levels over the simulation horizons and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
salisbury s tolerance levels for changes in net interest income in its income simulations varies depending on the magnitude of interest rate changes and level of risk based capital 
all changes are measured in comparison to the projected net interest income that would result from an unchanged rate scenario where interest rates remain stable over the forecast horizon 
the alco also evaluates the directional trends of net interest income  net interest margin and other financial measures over the forecast horizon for consistency with its liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability targets 
alco uses four interest rate scenarios to evaluate interest risk exposure and may vary these interest rate scenarios to show the effect of steepening or flattening changes in yield curves as well as parallel changes in interest rates 
at december  alco used the following interest rate scenarios unchanged interest rates  immediately rising interest rates immediate non parallel upward shift in market interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates to basis points for the year treasury  immediately falling interest rates immediate non parallel downward shift in market interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates to basis points for the year treasury  and two step shock rising interest rates ranging from basis points for short term rates basis points each year to basis points for the year treasury basis points for year one and basis points for year two 
deposit rates are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their relative historical insensitivity to market interest rate movements 
further  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
income simulations do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
as of december  net interest income simulations indicated that salisbury s exposure to changing interest rates over the simulation horizons remained within its tolerance levels 
the following table sets forth the estimated change in net interest income from an unchanged interest rate scenario over the periods indicated for changes in market interest rates using salisbury s financial instruments as of december december  in thousands months months immediately rising interest rates management s growth assumptions immediately falling interest rates management s growth assumptions gradually rising interest rates management s growth assumptions the negative exposure of net interest income to immediately and gradually rising rates as compared to the unchanged rate scenario results from a faster projected rise in the cost of funds versus income from earning assets  as relatively rate sensitive money market and time deposits re price faster than longer duration earning assets 
the negative exposure of net interest income to immediately falling rates as compared to an unchanged rate scenario results from a greater decline in earning asset yields compared to rates paid on funding liabilities  as a result of faster prepayments on existing assets and lower reinvestment rates on future loans originated and securities purchased 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions and back tests simulation results to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk or future net interest margin 
over time  the re pricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments and the composition of salisbury s balance sheet may change to a different degree than estimated 
simulation modeling assumes salisbury s expectation for future balance sheet growth  which is a function of the business environment and customer behavior 
another significant simulation assumption is the sensitivity of core savings deposits to fluctuations in interest rates 
income simulation results assume that changes in both core savings deposit rates and balances are related to changes in short term interest rates 
the assumed relationship between short term interest rate changes and core deposit rate and balance changes used in income simulation may differ from the alco s estimates 
lastly  mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans involve a level of risk that unforeseen changes in prepayment speeds may cause related cash flows to vary significantly in differing rate environments 
such changes could affect the level of reinvestment risk associated with cash flow from these instruments  as well as their market value 
changes in prepayment speeds could also increase or decrease the amortization of premium or accretion of discounts related to such instruments  thereby affecting interest income 

table of contents salisbury also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in changing interest rate environments 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure that may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to salisbury s capital and liquidity position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
available for sale equity securities are excluded from this analysis because the market value of such securities cannot be directly correlated with changes in interest rates
