see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
current economic environment during  our business was impacted by an uncertain and volatile market environment 
the positive momentum of an improved economic environment in late continued into early with signs of an improving us economy and the release of strong corporate earnings 
however  macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns during the course of made customers cautious as us and european economies showed signs of weakening  the european debt crisis intensified  and us congress struggled to reach an agreement on deficit reduction and raising the federal debt ceiling 
volatility continued through the end of  despite favorable us economic data  as the bipartisan congressional super committee failed to reach a deficit reduction agreement and european leaders failed to develop a concrete plan to address their own debt crisis 
with this volatile environment as a backdrop  our customers became cautious which elongated some sales cycles 
the conversion of our sales pipeline to new contract bookings in led to only bookings growth in which was slower than expected after consideration of our acquisitions of syncova solutions ltd 
syncova and black diamond performance reporting llc black diamond in february and june  respectively 
we grew our revenues during as compared to the same period of  which was primarily driven by an increase in our term license and other recurring revenues from bookings in the latter half of we are expecting to grow revenues by to in fiscal as a result of incremental booking activity and a full year of revenues we expect to recognize from syncova and black diamond 
as the current economic situation evolves  we will continue to evaluate its impact on our business and we will remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers 
we remain positive about our market position  current product portfolio and future product development 
we believe we are well positioned to maintain our competitive position in the longer term for the following reasons our portfolio accounting  trade order management  and compliance software is mission critical to our customers  our technology can be utilized to increase operational efficiency  we offer a wide range of deployment options on site  hosted  software as a service saas  etc 
to suit clients of any size and strategy  as a market leader in investment management technology  customers who spend money will attempt to minimize risk and therefore  favor our stability  reliability and scalability  
table of contents a more regulated  compliance oriented industry will drive an increased need for our systems  and our recurring revenue model and large customer base will continue to provide longer term stability 
we also believe that investment managers will be increasingly focused on providing increased and differentiated levels of service to their customers 
these factors have traditionally been demand drivers for our products 
we believe our recent financial results validate the strength and stability of our business and the attractiveness of our product portfolio to our customers 
for example  our continuing operations have grown revenue  operating income and margin  and operating cash flows over the past three years despite periods of severe market downturn and global economic volatility 
in addition  we expect to see a continuing increase in demand for our products during due to new regulations requiring more transparency and thus  sophisticated accounting software  and growth in the demand from international markets 
business focus in  several investment opportunities including continued international expansion  the build out of our black diamond and data services infrastructure products that take precedence over expanding our near term operating margins 
as a result  we will invest in systems infrastructure  increase our hiring and adjust our compensation programs as required to manage our growth  and develop and promote our products and services 
however  even with these investments  we anticipate our operating margin as a percentage of revenue to grow modestly in we believe our internal  or organic  growth and continued innovation with respect to our products and services are the foundation of our long term strategic plan 
we invested of revenues in product development in to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services  and to develop new products  features and services 
we also believe that an acquisition program is a supporting element of our corporate strategy which can strengthen our competitive position  expand our customer base  and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation 
we may continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy

our operating income from continuing operations in increased to million or of revenue from million or of revenue in although we were able to grow revenues and operating income in  our operating margins remained flat primarily resulting from the impact of our term implementation deferral  which caused a million reduction to operating profit compared to a million reduction to operating profit in the same period last year

non gaap financial measures and other operational data we also consider certain operating measures  such as the annual contract value acv of term license  black diamond and advent ondemand contracts and renewal rates  and certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  including non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share and free cash flow  in measuring the performance of our business 
the non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
however  we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
therefore  these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
in addition  undue reliance should not be placed upon non gaap or operating information because this information is neither standardized across companies nor subjected to the same control activities and audit procedures that produce our gaap financial results

we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe is reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring charges and related accruals  business combinations  disposition  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  legal contingencies  and sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
revenue recognition and deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue from term license  maintenance and other recurring  perpetual license fees  professional services and other 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents software licenses 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized once delivery to the distributor s customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs upon notification that software is available for electronic download through our fulfillment vendor  or when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point  or upon confirmation that product delivered fob shipping destination has been received 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  if such acceptance provisions are present  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through a credit review process  including credit reporting agency reports  publicly available customer information  financial statements and other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  but payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance  and frequently professional services 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the assets under administration  the number of site installations and the number of authorized users 
we categorize our revenues into two reporting elements recurring and non recurring revenues recurring revenue term licenses term license contracts include both the software license and maintenance 
we offer multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
we determine whether services are substantially complete by consulting with our professional services group and applying management judgment 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years  the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance we offer annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing period and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers 
revenue is recognized ratably daily over the term of the maintenance period typically one year 

table of contents other recurring revenues other recurring revenues include revenues from our software as a service saas services  data services and other recurring revenue transactions 
our saas services include advent ondemand  advent ondemand with data management and black diamond 
advent ondemand is the hosting and saas delivery of our suite of investment management solutions 
we recognize revenue ratably over the period of service which is generally one year 
advent ondemand with data management services include access to our software on a saas basis as well as full account aggregation  daily portfolio reconciliation  corporate actions processing and reference data management 
we price this comprehensive service offering based on the number of accounts managed for each customer 
we measure the number of accounts quarterly in arrears and we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed 
black diamond offers a platform that provides outsourced daily reconciliation and data management services as well as portfolio management and reporting delivered through an online web based application 
we price black diamond services based on the quantity of customer s accounts and the daily average of the assets under management aum within those accounts 
we measure the number and aum within customer accounts monthly in arrears and we recognize revenues for these services as they are performed 
our data services include advent custodial data acd  advent corporate actions aca and advent index data 
we recognize revenue from data services either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur within the subscription  based on the terms of the arrangement 
the company recognizes revenue from other recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement 
assets under administration revenues certain of our perpetual and term license contracts include asset based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using our software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are neither determinable nor due and payable until the conclusion of the measurement period  they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period  on a quarterly or annual basis 
incremental fees from perpetual aua contracts are included in other recurring revenues due to the periodic nature of the revenue stream 
thus  both term aua and perpetual aua contract incremental fees are included in recurring revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes term aua contract minimum fees over the period of service and continues to recognize incremental fees in arrears once clients contractually report the aua to the company  because the incremental fees are neither determinable nor due and payable until reported 
non recurring revenue professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
we establish vsoe of fair value for professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers 
our professional services are generally billed on a time and materials basis using hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
we recognize revenue as these professional services are 
table of contents performed except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria 
in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
occasionally  professional services are performed under a fixed fee arrangement 
for these arrangements  we defer revenue and related expenses until the services are complete 
professional services and other revenues also include revenue from our user conferences which is recognized upon completion of the conference 
perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered elements  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services elements  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties and or renewal rates 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred unless the only undelivered element is maintenance 
revenues from perpetual licenses are included in non recurring revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through future revenues  on non cancelable contracts  as prepaid contract expense 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the recognized net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  identified future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided 
table of contents for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sar and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
we determined that a blend of historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sars granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option and sar 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sars can vary significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in one of the underlying assumptions assumption base case assumption change value change assumption change value change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value historically  our sar and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
starting in february  we reduced the vesting period from years to years  and sars and stock option awards granted to employees now cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
our restricted stock unit rsu awards cliff vest after two years and after four years 
asc  compensation stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our annual forfeiture rate 
the annual forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience over the last ten years 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
a decrease in our annual forfeiture rate assumption would increase stock based compensation expense 
the estimated impact of a hypothetical basis point decrease in the annual forfeiture rate on stock based compensation expense for and unamortized stock based compensation expense at december  would have been increases of approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents restructuring charges and related accruals 
we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities  and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
disposition 
when we dispose of a subsidiary  we account for the divestiture in accordance with asc  discontinued operations 
the results of operations and the related charges for the discontinued operation are classified as net income from discontinued operation  net of applicable taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation are reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operation in our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
the calculation of the gain on disposal of our discontinued operation required management to make significant estimates in the resulting facility exit costs 
in connection with the sale of microedge  the company vacated its microedge facilities in new york and entered into a sub lease agreement with the purchaser whereby the purchaser will sub lease the premises for two years with the option to extend the sub lease term through the end of the lease term in the sub lease agreement was amended during the first quarter of under the amended sub lease agreement  the purchaser will sub lease the premises through the end of the lease term  with an option to terminate in september  subject to penalties 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating the probability that the purchaser will decide to terminate the sub lease agreement in  evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities related to this disposition 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect costs for our facility exit costs  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we determined that the company has two reporting units  domestic and international  which comprise our advent investment management segment  for the goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents advent s test for goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if advent determines  based on the qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required 
the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is a two step process the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
during the fourth quarter of  advent completed the qualitative goodwill impairment test  which involved assessing financial factors  including our market capitalization and profitability and deviations from projected results  as well as other business factors  including assessing the current business environment  changes in the operations of each reporting unit and the results of the prior year goodwill impairment test 
based on the results of this qualitative assessment  advent determined that the fair value of the reporting units is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount and as a result  a quantitative analysis would not be needed 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand  acceptance of products and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided 
in certain instances  we also make adjustments to receivable balances for concessions and product or seat downgrades 
those adjustments are analyzed under the same methodology as performed for the sales returns and included in the reserve balance 

table of contents our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for bad debt expense of million in each of fiscal  and  respectively

table of contents net revenues in thousands  except percentages total net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year we derive our revenues from two sources recurring revenues and non recurring revenues 
recurring revenues are comprised of term license  perpetual maintenance arrangements and other recurring revenue which includes revenues from black diamond  advent ondemand and incremental assets under administration aua fees from perpetual licenses 
the revenues from a term license  which includes both software license and maintenance services  are earned under a time based contract 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintenance fees on perpetual license arrangements 
other recurring revenues are derived from our subscription services and transaction based services as well as aua fees for certain perpetual arrangements 
non recurring revenues consists of professional services and other revenue and perpetual license fees 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  fees from training  and project management services and our client conferences 
perpetual license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products under a perpetual arrangement 
sales returns  which we generally do not provide to customers  are accounted for as deductions to these two revenue categories based on our historical experience 
since fiscal  recurring revenues have represented close to of our total revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues revenues from recurring sources revenues from non recurring sources net revenues increased in and due to continued customer adoption for many of our products and services  which principally includes increases in sales of our apx and geneva products 
the year over year growth in total net revenues for was due to higher revenues from recurring sources  primarily term license revenues  which reflected million or growth in compared to the same period in the increase in term license revenues is primarily due to our bookings activity from the previous months and growth in sales of our apx and geneva products  and to a lesser extent  our moxy and tamale products and revenues from our syncova products  which contributed million of revenue since its acquisition on february  additionally contributing to the increase in recurring revenues is growth from other recurring revenues  which consists of our data services  outsourced services  web based services  aua fees for certain perpetual arrangements and revenues from black diamond products  which contributed million to revenues since being acquired on june  the increase in non recurring revenues was due to greater consulting activity as we experienced an increase in new service engagements during as a result of bookings from the latter half of and first half of revenues derived from international sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in international revenue in dollar amount during is primarily due to an increase in new business in international locations booked in the prior months due to an improvement in economic conditions in those regions  and to a lesser extent  increases in the market values of aua balances for our emea customers 
we plan to continue expanding our international sales efforts  both in our current markets and elsewhere

revenues from term licenses  which include both the software license and maintenance services for term licenses  grew in from and represented of total recurring revenues in and in and the growth of term license revenues in and reflects the continued layering of incremental annual contract value acv of term licenses sold in previous periods into our term revenue and the continued market acceptance of our products 
as a percentage of total net revenues  total recurring revenues remained flat at during  as the increase was partially offset by the net term license revenue deferral for fiscal and a decrease in perpetual maintenance revenues

these decreases were due to maintenance de activations from customer attrition  maintenance level downgrades  reductions in products licensed or number of users by clients  perpetual license customers migrating to term licenses  and continued decrease in new perpetual license customers  partially offset by the impact of price increases 
other recurring revenues  which primarily include revenues from incremental assets under administration fees from perpetual licenses  data services  outsourced services  advent ondemand  web based services and black diamond  increased million and million during and  respectively 
in  the increase in other recurring revenues is primarily due to growth in revenues from data services  outsourced services  web based services and million from black diamond  which we acquired on june  in addition  incremental assets under administration fees 
table of contents from perpetual licenses increased million in as our clients experienced growth in new assets and increases in the market value of aua balances despite market volatility during in  the increase in other recurring revenues was primarily due to growth in revenues of million from outsourced services as several large implementations went live in september and to a lesser extent  from the increase of million in our subscription and data management revenues

professional services projects related to axys  moxy and partner products generally can be completed in a two to six month time period  while services related to geneva and apx products may require a four to nine month implementation period 
we defer professional services revenue for services performed on term license implementations that are not considered substantially complete 
service revenue is deferred until the implementation is complete and remaining services are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion  we recognize a pro rata amount of professional services fees earned based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
the remaining deferred professional services revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining contract length

the increase in total cost of revenues in absolute dollars in was due principally to increases in payroll and related from headcount additions in our client support and services groups from our recent acquisitions and heads from black diamond and syncova  respectively and fees paid to third party consultants to support our increase in demand for technical support and consulting services 
consistent with the increase in headcount  allocated expenses to our services and support organization increased 
additionally  amortization of developed technology associated with our recent acquisitions of goya as  syncova and black diamond contributed to the overall increase 
gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin percentage in resulted from the increase in amortization resulting from our recent acquisitions  allocation of more facility and infrastructure expenses due to headcount growth in our sales and support organization  lower utilization of our consulting employees and from the increase in the net deferral of professional services revenue related to term license implementations 
headcount in our cost of revenues organization grew in  compared to overall company headcount growth of  resulting in a higher allocation of facility and infrastructure expense in consistent with historical trends  we are still experiencing negative gross margins on professional services revenues as a result of the manner in which we run our professional services business which we do not necessarily manage for profitability 
rather than focusing on margins of professional services which compose less than of our total net revenues  we are focused on having new clients live on our products or services shortly after contract signing and then having them continually renew their higher margin term license  perpetual maintenance or other recurring contracts after their initial terms expire 
to implement our products as quickly as possible  we at times add new contractors or new employees  as 
table of contents needed  to perform the professional services resulting in lower billable utilization 
to a lesser extent  the significant deferral of professional services revenues and costs associated with term license implementation and our user conference also contributed to our historical negative gross margins 
cost of recurring revenues in thousands  except percentages cost of recurring revenues percent of total recurring revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year cost of recurring revenues consists of the direct costs related to providing and supporting our outsourced services  providing technical support services under maintenance and term license agreements and other services for recurring revenues  and royalties paid to third party vendors 
gross margins for cost of recurring revenues declined to during from in both and as a result of increased payroll costs due to headcount additions from the acquisition of black diamond and the build out of our service and support organization internationally  and higher allocation of facility and it expenses resulting from the increase in headcount 
cost of recurring revenues fluctuated due to the following in thousands change from to change from to increased payroll and related increased allocation in of facility and infrastructure expenses increased outside services increased computers and telecom increased depreciation increased travel and entertainment increased decreased royalties various other items total change the increase in absolute dollars in and was due primarily to an increase in payroll and related costs resulting from increases in headcount which enables us to deliver the technical support services we provide to our growing number of clients in their day to day use of our software 
headcount increased to employees at december  heads from black diamond from and employees at december  and december   respectively 
we allocate facility and infrastructure expenses based on headcount and consistent with the increase in departmental headcount  we allocated more of these costs to our cost of recurring revenues departments in the increase to outside services reflects more activity and utilization of third party consultants during and the increase in computers and telecom  and depreciation reflects the build out and utilization of new data servers during and travel and entertainment costs increased due to increased travel by our employees associated with providing client support services as well as attending our client conference

consistent with the increase in professional service activity  we experienced an increase in travel and entertainment  and outside services costs 
increases in marketing were a result of increased marketing activity associated with our user conference held in boston in september  which had record attendance 
increases in conference costs were primarily due to higher accommodation costs associated with the user conference 

table of contents the decrease in absolute dollars in primarily reflects the redeployment of consulting employees to other areas of our business  resulting in the decreases in payroll related costs and allocation in of facility and infrastructure expenses during headcount in our consulting group was and at december  and  respectively

as our facility costs increased and headcount in our other departments grew at a higher rate than our general and administrative department  we allocated out more facility and information technology costs resulting in less general and administrative expense during the increase in legal and professional fees during was due to higher acquisition related fees of million primarily associated with the acquisitions of syncova and black diamond  which we acquired in february and june  respectively 
payroll and related costs increased during fiscal as a result of additional headcount and annual merit increases 
headcount increased slightly to at december  from at december  in addition  we experienced an increase in outside contractors as a result of our enterprise resource planning erp upgrade project 
the increase in computers and telecom was due to an increase in maintenance contract costs and equipment purchases related to the increase in headcount from our acquisitions and for our international offices 
the increase in facilities was primarily associated with additional rent expense related to black diamond offices 
depreciation also increased due to leasehold improvement additions related to black diamond and our beijing office 
the increase in total general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in was primarily due to the increases in facilities costs related to our new facilities in new york and boston and  to a lesser extent  our new offices in beijing and singapore which we opened during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands fiscal years thereafter total operating lease obligations  net of sub lease income debt total on october   we completed the sale of our microedge subsidiary 
see note  discontinued operation  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the principal terms of the divestiture 
with the exception of the microedge facilities in new york city  the leases related to microedge have been transferred to the purchaser 
in connection with the sale of microedge  the company entered into a sub lease agreement with microedge llc  whereby microedge llc will sub lease approximately  square feet of the  square feet of office space located at west th street in new york  new york from the company 
under the sub lease agreement  the purchaser contracted to sub lease the premises for two years with the option to extend the sub lease term through the end of the lease term in the sub lease agreement was amended during the first quarter of under the amended sub lease agreement  the purchaser will sub lease the premises through the end of the lease term  with an option to terminate in september  subject to penalties 
the sub lease agreement became effective upon the close of sale of microedge on october  as of december   microedge had operating lease commitments totaling million  less estimated sublease income of million  which are not reflected in the above table 
as of december   the principal outstanding under our credit agreement was million which is due in full no later than november  at december  and  we had a gross liability of million and million  respectively  for uncertain tax positions 
if recognized  the impact on our statement of operations would be to decrease our income tax expense and increase our net income by million 
the impact on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items 
since almost all of this liability relates to reserves against deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize in the short term  we cannot estimate the timing of potential future cash settlements and have not included any estimates in the table of contractual cash obligations above 
our cash payments for federal income taxes will continue to be or less of taxable income through as we have significant net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
other liquidity and capital resources considerations as noted above  we expect our cash payments for federal income taxes to be at or less of taxable income in as we utilize net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards against current 
table of contents income taxes 
beyond  we expect cash payments for federal income taxes to be about of taxable income as we near the end of our net operating losses carryforwards and utilize tax credits to reduce our cash taxes down to the alternative minimum tax rate of 
our liquidity and capital resources in any period could also be affected by the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and sars  and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from this and from the issuance of common stock from our rsus could also affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
we expect that for the next year  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund other acquisitions  repurchase additional common stock  or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources  bookings performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operations and availability under our debt agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  interest and repayment of debt principal and financing activities in the next months 
however  if we identify opportunities that exceed our current expectation  we may choose to seek additional capital resources through debt or equity financing 
however  such financing may not be available at all  or if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us and could be dilutive 
the company has reviewed its needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of its foreign subsidiaries 
the company presently intends to continue to invest indefinitely all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property  plant and equipment requirements 
at december   we had approximately million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose service and certain license revenues and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally as of december   million of goodwill from the acquisition of these entities are denominated in foreign currency 
therefore a hypothetical change of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million and could increase or decrease our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by approximately million 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities as of december  our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in

we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
effective november   we also have interest rate risk relating to debt of million and associated accrued interest under our term loan a facility which is indexed to jpmorgan chase bank  na s prime rate or libor
