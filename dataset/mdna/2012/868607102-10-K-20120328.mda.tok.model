table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance  and accrued warranty 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when products are shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized after the customer is notified that the products have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would adversely affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provide for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would adversely affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of our large and diverse product line and the customized nature of each order  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments which are based on estimates are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the calculations to estimate costs not captured in the bill of materials take into account the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances  and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not fully known until physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s locations 
we conduct semi annual physical inventories at a majority of locations and schedule them in a manner that provides coverage in each of our calendar quarters 
as of december   the company reported inventories of million  of which was subject to a physical inventory during the fourth quarter 
we have invested significant resources in our continuing effort to improve the physical inventory process and accuracy of our inventory accounting system 
fair value of assets held for sale the company evaluates the carrying value of property held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a property s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of its properties held for sale based on appraisals and other current market data 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier  and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates  and any subsequent changes in estimates  may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience
