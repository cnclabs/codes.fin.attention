us business transformation the us business transformation measures in  and included continuation of our us refranchising  g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term growth strategy  and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases 
in the years ended december  and december   we recorded pre tax losses of million and million from refranchising in the us  respectively 
in the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax refranchising gain of million in the us the losses recorded in the years ended december  and december  are primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us  principally a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants 
the non cash impairment charges that we recorded related to our offers to refranchise these company operated kfc restaurants in the us decreased depreciation expense versus what we would have otherwise recorded by million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item  resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants 
refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note and the store portfolio strategy section of the md a 
in connection with our g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  we recorded pre tax charges of million  million and million in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our ljs and a w us businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding  we recorded a non cash charge of million  which resulted in no related income tax benefit  in closures and impairment expenses in the fourth quarter of to write off goodwill associated with our ljs and a w us businesses we owned at the time 
additionally  the company recognized a reduction to franchise and license fees and income of million  pre tax  in the year ended december  related to investments in our us brands 
these investments reflected our reimbursements to kfc franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of kentucky grilled chicken 
the reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship 
ljs and a w divestitures during the fourth quarter of we sold the long john silver s and a w all american food restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions 
we recognized million of pre tax losses and other costs primarily in closures and impairment income expenses during as a result of these transactions 
additionally  we recognized million of tax benefits related to tax losses associated with the transactions 
in  these businesses contributed to both system sales and franchise and license fees and income for the us segment  and to both system sales and franchise and license fees and income for the yri segment 
while these businesses contributed to both the us and yri segments operating profit in  the impact on our consolidated operating profit was not significant 
refranchising of equity markets outside the us during the year ended december   we decided to refranchise or close all of our remaining company operated pizza hut restaurants in the uk market 
while an asset group comprising approximately dine in restaurants did not meet the criteria for held for sale classification as of december   our decision to sell was considered an impairment indicator 
as such we reviewed this asset group for potential impairment and determined that its carrying value was not recoverable based upon our estimate of expected refranchising proceeds and holding period cash flows anticipated while we continue to operate the restaurants as company units 
accordingly  we wrote this asset group down to our estimate of its fair value  which is based on the sales price we would expect to receive from a buyer 
this fair value determination considered current market conditions  trends in the pizza hut uk business  and prices for similar transactions in the restaurant industry and resulted in a pre tax  non cash write down of million which was recorded to refranchising gain loss 
this impairment charge decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by approximately million in this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item  resulting in depreciation expense in the yri segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants 
we will continue to review the asset group for any further necessary impairment until the date it is sold 
the write down does not include any allocation of the pizza hut uk reporting unit goodwill in the asset group carrying value 
this additional non cash write down would be recorded  consistent with our historical policy  if the asset group ultimately meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale 
upon the ultimate sale of the restaurants  depending on the form of the transaction  we could also be required to record a charge for the fair value of any guarantee of future lease payments for any leases we assign to a franchisee and for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment associated with pizza hut uk 
the decision to refranchise or close all remaining pizza hut restaurants in the uk was considered to be a goodwill impairment indicator 
we determined that the fair value of our pizza hut uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and as such there was no impairment of the approximately million in goodwill attributable to this reporting unit 
we also recorded a million loss in refranchising gain loss for obligations that we believe are probable related to the proposed refranchising of pizza hut uk 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our company operated restaurants  comprised of kfc and pizza huts  to an existing latin american franchise partner 
the buyer is also serving as the master franchisee for mexico which had kfcs and pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction 
the write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill 
this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit 
during the year ended december  we recognized a non cash million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our kfc taiwan equity market 
during the year ended december  we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in taiwan  which consisted of kfcs 
we included in our december  financial statements a non cash write off of million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan 
neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit 
the amount of goodwill write off was based on the relative fair values of the taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained 
the fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee  which included a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee was estimated to pay the company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction 
the fair value of the taiwan business retained consisted of expected net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees  including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction 
we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising were substantially consistent with market 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of million  was determined not to be impaired subsequent to the refranchising as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in shanghai  china on may  we acquired an additional ownership in the entity that operates more than kfcs in shanghai  china for million  increasing our ownership to 
prior to our acquisition of this additional interest  this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting 
concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition 
as required by gaap  we remeasured our previously held ownership in the entity  which had a recorded value of million at the date of acquisition  at fair value and recognized a gain of million accordingly 
this gain  which resulted in no related income tax expense  was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income 
under the equity method of accounting  we previously reported our share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the restaurants owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
subsequent to the date of the acquisition  we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statements of income 
we no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting 
net income attributable to our partner s ownership percentage is recorded in net income noncontrolling interests 
for the year ended december   the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased company sales by million  decreased franchise and license fees and income by million and increased operating profit by million versus the year ended december  the impact of the acquisition on net income yum brands  inc was not significant to the year ended december  extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a rd week every five or six years 
fiscal year included a rd week in the fourth quarter for all our us businesses and certain of our yri businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
our china division reports on a monthly basis and thus did not have a rd week 
see the system sales growth section within our md a for further discussion on the impact of rd week on system sales 
the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the rd week on revenues and operating profit us yri unallocated total revenues company sales franchise and license fees total revenues operating profit franchise and license fees restaurant profit general and administrative expenses operating profit a a the million benefit was offset throughout by investments  including franchise development incentives  as well as higher than normal spending  such as restaurant closures in the us and yri 
acquisition of controlling interest in little sheep on february  we paid million to acquire an additional interest in little sheep  a leading chinese casual dining concept with approximately system wide restaurants headquartered in inner mongolia  china 
this acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately of the business 
we expect that the consolidation of little sheep will increase our revenue in china in by approximately  with only a corresponding modest impact to operating profit given the transaction and transition related costs we expect to incur in our initial year of ownership 
yri acquisitions on october  yri acquired kfc restaurants from an existing franchisee in south africa for million 
on july   we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the co branded rostik s kfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states 
as a result  we acquired company ownership of restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of restaurants  which our partner previously managed as master franchisee 
we paid cash of million  net of settlement of a long term note receivable of million  and assumed long term debt of million which was subsequently repaid 
the remaining balance of the purchase price of million will be paid in cash by july the impact of consolidating these businesses on all line items within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant to the comparison of our year over year results and is not expected to materially impact our results going forward 
pizza hut south korea goodwill impairment as a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our pizza hut south korea business  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for this market during this charge was recorded in closure and impairment income expenses in our consolidated statement of income and was allocated to our international division for performance reporting purposes 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about  down from its current level of  with our primary remaining focus being refranchising at kfc and taco bell to about and company ownership  respectively 
consistent with this strategy   and company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
at december   we have offered for refranchising approximately kfcs in the us additionally  we have offered for refranchise all remaining company owned restaurants in the pizza hut uk business approximately restaurants remaining as of december  and during  we refranchised all company owned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico restaurants and kfcs in taiwan restaurants 
the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising gain loss  pre tax refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of g a declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit  which reflects the decrease in company sales  and g a expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised 
the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
in these tables  decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year 
increased franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year 
the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on total revenues as described above china yri us worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues china yri us worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on operating profit as described above china yri us worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income increased franchise and license expenses decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit china yri us worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income increased franchise and license expenses decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit internal revenue service proposed adjustment on june  the company received a revenue agent report from the internal revenue service the irs relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years through the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
the proposed adjustment would result in approximately million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately million 
furthermore  if the irs prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal the potential additional taxes for these later years  through  computed on a similar basis to the additional taxes  would be approximately million plus net interest to date of approximately million 
we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws  treasury regulations and relevant case law 
we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain  the company will continue to provide for its position in accordance with gaap 
there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
additionally  if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue  such increases could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded 
the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 
international reporting change in the first quarter of  we will begin reporting information for our india business as a standalone reporting segment separate from yri as a result of changes to our management reporting structure 
while our consolidated results will not be impacted  we will restate our historical segment information during for consistent presentation

the units excluded offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  train stations  subways  convenience stores  stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
as licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units  we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information at this time

this item includes local taxes  withholding taxes  and shareholder level taxes  net of foreign tax credits 
the favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the us where tax rates are generally lower than the us rate 
in and  the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings 
in  the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year 
adjustments to reserves and prior years 
this item includes the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns  including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets  and changes in tax reserves  including interest thereon  established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome

in  net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the decrease was driven by higher net borrowings  partially offset by an increase in share repurchases 
consolidated financial condition the increase in restricted cash was due to million in funds placed in escrow which were restricted to the acquisition of an additional interest in little sheep 
see notes and the decrease in intangible assets was primarily due to the ljs and a w divestitures 
see note the decrease in short term borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of million of senior unsecured notes in april  offset by million of senior unsecured notes due in june being classified as short term as of december  liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment 
net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion in each of the last ten fiscal years  including over billion in we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
however  unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns  we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
additionally  as of december  we had approximately billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in november  primarily related to a domestic facility 
we are in the process of renewing these facilities 
china and yri represented more than of the company s operating profit in excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development 
to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending  including share repurchases  dividends and debt repayments  we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner 
if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 
we currently have investment grade ratings from standard poor s rating services bbb and moody s investors service baa 
while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating  a downgrade would increase the company s current borrowing costs and could impact the company s ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary 
based on the amount and composition of our debt at december   which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities  our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in capital spending  including approximately million in china  million in yri and million in the us for  we estimate capital spending will be approximately billion 
during the year ended december  we repurchased shares for million  which includes the effect of million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the fiscal year 
in january  our board of directors authorized share repurchases through july of up to million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock  and on november   our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may of up to million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock 
at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under these authorizations 
shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of to of net income 
in connection with the proposal to acquire an additional of little sheep  we placed million in escrow to demonstrate availability of funds to acquire additional shares in this business 
the funds placed in escrow were restricted to the pending acquisition of little sheep and are separately presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  in february  the funds were released from escrow upon our acquisition of little sheep

borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in november and includes participating banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or is determined by an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
we also have a million  syndicated international revolving credit facility the icf which matures in november and includes six banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
there was available credit of million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum 
these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
given the company s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december  with a considerable amount of cushion 
we are in the process of renewing these facilities 
our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  including million in senior unsecured notes due in july both the credit facility and the icf contain cross default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million  or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness  will constitute a default under such agreement 
our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled  or such indebtedness is not discharged  within days after notice 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other d total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the libor forward yield curve 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to nearly  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
d other consists of pension plan funding obligations and projected payments for deferred compensation 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities also include potential payments that would be refunded in a future year and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees  the most significant of which are in the us and uk 
the most significant of these plans  the yum retirement plan the plan  is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred 
our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan s funded status 
at december  the plan was in a net underfunded position of million 
the uk pension plans are in a net underfunded position of million at our measurement date 
based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans  we currently estimate that we will be required to contribute approximately million to the plan in no required contributions to the uk pension plans are expected in investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption 
future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in and beyond 
our post retirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made post retirement benefit payments of million in and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table 
see note for further details about our pension and post retirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreed to provide financial support  if required  to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs 
as part of this agreement  we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately million and two letters of credit totaling approximately million in support of the franchisee loan program at december  one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee 
the other letter of credit could be used  in certain circumstances  to satisfy our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program 
the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were million with an additional million available for lending at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately million and million of debt outstanding as of december  and december   respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review long lived assets of restaurants primarily pp e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization that are currently operating semi annually for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant s forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable  we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value 
key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after tax cash flows of the restaurant  which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay  and discount rate 
the after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer  if available  or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows  reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay  for the group of restaurants 
the after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets 
historically  these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets 
the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant  such as trademark brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
these definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted after tax cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property  plant and equipment 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us  our yri business units typically individual countries and our china division brands 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit 
we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
when we refranchise restaurants  we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained 
the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee  which include a deduction for the anticipated  future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 
appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value amount being disposed if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates 
when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world 
the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company 
the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising 
others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 
during  the company s reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our kfc us operating segment and our pizza hut united kingdom uk business unit 
within our kfc us operating segment  restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
within our pizza hut uk business unit  delivery restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables guarantees franchise and license receivable balances include royalties  initial fees and other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services 
our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december  as such  we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december  we issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants  facilitating franchisee development and equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification  such as franchise lease renewals  when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 
the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  is approximately million  at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
additionally  we have guaranteed approximately million of franchisee loans for various programs 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and  historically  we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees 
if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees 
at december  we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable 
if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of  million and a fair value of plan assets of million at december  the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at december  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plan 
we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately million in the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss due to a decrease in the discount rate 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets  for purposes of determining pension expense  at december  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point change in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in discount rates over time along with actual asset returns below expected returns have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax actuarial net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule 
we re evaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives  respectively 
upon each stock award grant we re evaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated pre vesting forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income taxes at december   we had valuation allowances of million to reduce our billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in currently profitable us federal and state  and foreign jurisdictions as well as us federal and state tax credit carryovers that may be carried forward for ten years 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
additionally  we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis  totaling approximately billion at december   as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested 
if our intentions regarding the duration of theses investments change  deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 
at december  and december  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 
foreign currency exchange rate risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings  cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
historically  we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 
the combined operating profits of china and yri constitute more than of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
for the fiscal year ended december  operating profit would have decreased approximately million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors
