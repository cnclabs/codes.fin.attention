results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income from continuing operations before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements year ended august  sales training and consulting services products leasing total sales cost of sales training and consulting services products leasing total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense discount on related party receivable income from continuing operations before income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal sales we offer a variety of training courses  consulting services  and training related products that are focused on leadership  execution  productivity  trust  loyalty  sales performance  and education that are provided both domestically and internationally through our sales force  certified client facilitators  international licensee partners  or through the internet in on line presentations 
for the fiscal year ended august   our consolidated sales increased by million to million 
the following sales analysis for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary sales channels 
table of contents us canada direct this channel includes our four regional field offices that serve clients in the united states and canada and our government services group 
during fiscal  sales through our four regional offices increased by million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
we believe that our strategy of additional sales personnel  increased events  and focus on our practice groups were key drivers of increased sales at our regional sales offices during the year 
partially offsetting increased regional office sales were expected reductions from contracts with a governmental agency that included more revenue in the initial phases which occurred primarily in fiscal of the contracts than in subsequent periods 
as a result  sales through our government services group decreased million compared with fiscal however  during the third quarter of fiscal we won a renewal of these contracts with the governmental agency and we expect to continue to deliver training and consulting services throughout the life of these contracts  which includes the first three quarters of fiscal  at similar levels to those delivered in the corresponding periods of fiscal we believe that we will be successful in renewing these contracts in fiscal  but we cannot guarantee a successful outcome as many of the aspects of renewal are out of our control 
our sales through the us canada direct channel in future periods will be sensitive to general economic conditions and renewal of the existing contracts  such as the government services contracts described above 
however  we remain optimistic about future growth and looking forward  our pipeline of booked days and awarded revenue continues to be strong and at august  exceeded the prior year 
subsequent to august  the northeastern region of the united states suffered significant infrastructure damage from hurricane sandy and other storms that followed 
as a result of these storms  many of our clients were unable to operate their businesses for a period of time 
although we expect our clients to reschedule postponed programs in future periods  we anticipate that storm related cancelations may adversely impact our first quarter sales in fiscal by approximately million to million 
international direct our three international offices are located in australia  japan  and the united kingdom 
the improvement in international direct sales was primarily due to increased sales in japan  which increased million compared with fiscal the sales growth in japan was primarily due to the recovery of the japanese economy from the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northern japan during march sales were also up million at our office in the united kingdom during fiscal however  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales at our office in australia  which were primarily attributable to sales force performance issues that we have addressed and we expect improvement in australia in future periods 
during fiscal  the translation sales from foreign currencies to united states dollars had a million favorable impact on our international office sales 
international licensees in countries or foreign locations where we do not have an office  our training and consulting services are delivered through independent licensees  which may translate and adapt our curriculums to local preferences and customs  if necessary 
our licensee sales increased million compared with the prior year as many of our licensees reported strengthening sales in their countries during the year  which resulted in increased royalties 
however  continued civil unrest and economic uncertainty in some of the countries where our licensees operate may have adverse effects on certain licensees performance in future periods 
national account practices our national account practices are comprised of programs that are not typically offered in our regional field offices and include the leader in me curriculum designed for students from our education practice  helping clients succeed from the sales performance group  and winning customer loyalty from our customer loyalty practice 
during fiscal  our national account practice sales increased due to a million increase in education practice sales resulting from a general increase in demand for these school based services as the leader in me program continues to generate favorable results at schools in the united states and in other countries 
our sales performance practice also increased sales by million over the prior year as this group obtained new contracts during the fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in customer loyalty practice sales primarily resulting from the completion of a large contract in fiscal 
table of contents self funded marketing this group includes our public programs  book and audio sales  and speeches through our speakers bureau 
the decrease in sales was due to reduced public speaking revenues resulting primarily from the retirement of dr 
stephen r 
covey from public speaking events in late fiscal decreased speakers bureau sales were partially offset by a million increase in book and audio product sales resulting primarily from the release of new publications during the year 
we expect to continue to release new publications in future periods and believe that these new publications will continue to show strong performance in the marketplace 
other our other sales are comprised primarily of leasing sales and shipping and handling revenues 
the increase in other sales was primarily due to improved leasing revenues resulting from new lease contracts at our corporate headquarters 
we continue to have vacant space available for lease at our corporate headquarters campus and we are actively seeking new tenants for this available property 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of services provided or the cost of goods sold 
our cost of sales includes the direct costs of conducting seminars  including presenter costs  materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  the mix of training and consulting courses sold to clients  prices of materials  labor rates  changes in product discount levels  and freight costs 
our consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended august  increased to million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to significantly improved sales in fiscal over fiscal our consolidated gross margin increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased international licensee royalty revenues  increased facilitator sales  and increased intellectual property license sales  all of which have higher gross margins than the majority of our other programs and services 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased million compared with fiscal however  as a percent of sales  sg a expenses declined to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a million increase in associate costs resulting from increased sales commissions and bonuses resulting from improved sales and operating results  and the addition of new personnel  a million increase in advertising and promotional costs that were primarily related to the launch of our new productivity offering the choices to extraordinary productivity and the launch of new strategic marketing initiatives that we believe had a favorable impact on overall fiscal sales  and a million increase in non cash share based compensation costs  primarily resulting from performance awards granted in the fourth quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in rent and utilities expenses primarily the result of reduced rent expense at our japan office and reduced telephone and communication expenses  a million decrease in legal expenses resulting primarily from the settlement of certain litigation and the reimbursement of previously expensed legal costs  million of decreased professional services costs compared to the prior year  and a million reduction in outsourced services charges resulting primarily from a reduction in outsourced information technology support costs 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased by million compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation of certain capital assets during the latter half of fiscal based upon anticipated capital asset acquisitions in fiscal and previous depreciation expense levels  we currently expect depreciation expense to decline compared with fiscal amounts and to total approximately million during fiscal 
table of contents amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets decreased million due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets in late fiscal as a result  we currently expect that intangible asset amortization expense will remain consistent with fiscal levels and to total approximately million in fiscal discount on related party receivable due to the settlement of litigation during fiscal  with a required settlement payment by fc organizational products fcop  the amount of cash we received from fcop was reduced from previous forecasts and our receivable balance from fcop increased during fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received revised information from fcop regarding scheduled payments to us and we reclassified a portion of the fcop receivable to long term assets and recorded a discount charge of million to reduce the long term receivable to its estimated present value at august  we discounted the long term portion of the receivable based on forecasted repayments at a discount rate of percent  which was the estimated risk adjusted borrowing rate of fcop at august  this rate was based on a variety factors including  but not limited to  current market interest rates for various qualities of comparable debt  discussions with fcop s lenders  and an evaluation of the realizability fcop s future cash flows 
based on improved operating results at fcop during calendar and their forecasted cash flows in future periods  we believe that we will collect amounts receivable from fcop and the discount will be recovered as interest income in future periods 
however  the failure of fcop to pay us for these receivables may have an adverse impact on our liquidity  financial position  and cash flows in future periods 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was percent and remained consistent with fiscal our effective income tax rate was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to taxable interest income on outstanding management common stock loans and uncertain tax positions 
these increases in our effective rate were partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax credits in excess of the tax on income taxed by both us and foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal includes the benefit of foreign tax credits to be claimed on our us federal income tax returns 
we anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will remain significantly less than our income tax provision during the foreseeable future as we utilize domestic net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred income tax assets 
for instance  during fiscal we paid million of cash for income taxes 
after our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we will be able to utilize our foreign tax credits  which will reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
after utilization of these deferred tax assets  we expect our cash paid for income taxes to increase and match more closely a normalized provision for income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales the following analysis of our sales performance for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary delivery channels as defined above 
us canada direct during fiscal we had increased sales at all of our offices in this channel  including our government services group 
sales through our regional sales offices increased by million compared with fiscal these sales increases were broad based across nearly all of our practices and training programs offered 
sales through our government services group increased million primarily due to contracts with a division of the federal government obtained during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we recognized million from these government services contracts during fiscal  which is more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues for the year 

table of contents international direct the improvement in international direct sales was primarily due to increased sales in japan  which increased million on a continuing operations basis compared to fiscal despite the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northern japan during march and caused our office to be closed for two weeks  we were able to recognize improved sales primarily due to increased publishing sales and the favorable impact of translating yen denominated sales to us dollars 
although the natural disaster produced increased cancelations during the fiscal year  training and consulting sales remained flat compared to the prior year 
sales were also up million at our office in australia  and decreased by million at our office in the united kingdom 
international licensees during fiscal  the majority of our larger foreign licensees had increased sales compared to the prior year  which resulted in a million increase in licensee royalty revenues 
national account practices during  we had increased sales in each of the national account practices  which was led by a million increase from our education practice 
self funded marketing the increase in sales was primarily attributable to royalties related to new books 
however  with the retirement of dr 
stephen r 
covey from public speaking engagements during late fiscal  overall speaking presentation revenues are expected to decline in future periods 
other the decrease in other sales was primarily due to reduced leasing revenues as certain lease contracts at our corporate headquarters expired in prior periods 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to significantly improved sales during fiscal our consolidated gross margin was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the slight decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to margins on a government services contract sale that included intellectual property that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal that did not repeat in the current year  increased sales of training programs that have higher costs  and decreased facilitator sales 
these factors were partially offset by increased international licensee royalty revenues in fiscal operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal however  as a percent of sales  sg a expenses declined to percent compared to percent of sales in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a million increase in commissions and bonuses resulting from improved sales and financial results compared to the prior year  a million increase in salaries and related costs resulting primarily from the addition of new personnel  a million increase in share based compensation costs primarily from awards granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million increase in conference costs from our sales and delivery conference  which has been previously held on a smaller scale  a million increase in travel expenses  and a million increase in research and development costs related to the maintenance and development of training programs and curriculum 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in costs resulting from the prior year reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by our ceo for business travel pursuant to a change in policy approved by the board of directors  and bonuses for the income tax consequences resulting from the forgiveness of certain management stock loans 
these costs  which totaled million  did not repeat during fiscal amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets decreased million due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately percent was somewhat higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to taxable interest income on outstanding management common stock loans and the effects of uncertain tax positions 
these increases in our effective rate were partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax credits in excess of the tax on income taxed both by us and foreign jurisdictions 
we paid significant amounts of withholding tax on foreign royalties during fiscal and fiscal we also recognized taxable income on repatriated earnings from foreign income that are taxed in both foreign and domestic jurisdictions 
during fiscal  we concluded that domestic foreign tax credits will be available to offset our fiscal foreign withholding taxes and taxes on foreign dividends 
however  for fiscal we concluded that domestic foreign tax credits were not available to offset such taxes 
segment review our sales are primarily comprised of training and consulting sales and related products 
based on the consistent nature of our services and products and the types of customers for these services  we function as a single operating segment 
however  to improve comparability with previous periods  operating information for our us canada  international  and corporate services operations is presented below 
our us canada operations are responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting services in the united states and canada 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
our corporate services information includes leasing income and certain corporate operating expenses 
the following table sets forth sales data by these operations for the periods indicated 
for further information regarding our reporting segments and geographic information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k in thousands 
year ended august  percent change percent change us canada international total corporate and eliminations consolidated quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for the years ended august  and the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
we utilize a modified week fiscal year that ends on august of each year 
corresponding quarterly periods generally consist of week periods during the fiscal year 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends in thousands  except for per share amounts 

table of contents year ended august  unaudited november february may august net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative depreciation amortization income from operations discount on related party receivable income from operations before income taxes net income net income per share basic diluted year ended august  unaudited november february may august net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative depreciation amortization income from operations income from operations before income taxes net income net income per share basic diluted training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods 
our fourth fiscal quarter generally has higher sales and income from operations than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased facilitator sales that occur during that quarter 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings  the addition of new organizational customers  and the elimination of underperforming offerings 
liquidity and capital resources summary during fiscal our liquidity position continued to strengthen and was favorably affected by improved income from operations and reduced cash used for investing and financing activities 
at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities increased significantly to million compared with million at august  of our million in cash and cash equivalents at august   million was held at our foreign subsidiaries 
we routinely repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries and consider foreign cash a key component of our overall liquidity position 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of services in the normal course of business and proceeds from our available million revolving line of credit 
our primary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities  capital expenditures  working capital expansion  potential acquisition earn outs  and debt repayment 
on march   we entered into the first modification agreement to our previously existing amended and restated secured credit agreement the restated credit agreement with our existing lender 
the 
table of contents primary purpose of the first modification agreement was to extend the maturity date of the restated credit agreement  which originally expired on march  on june   we entered into the second modification agreement to the restated credit agreement 
the primary purpose of the second modification agreement was to extend the maturity date of the credit facility from march  to march  we wanted to ensure the availability of our line of credit facility over the next three years so that we can use excess cash to pursue special initiatives  such as the potential repurchase of shares of our common stock  and for other growth opportunities 
the second modification agreement continues to provide a revolving line of credit facility the revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of million and with interest continuing at libor plus percent 
the other terms and conditions in the second modification agreement are substantially the same as those defined in the restated credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement also provided a term loan the term loan that allowed us to borrow million for general business purposes 
the amount borrowed on the term loan is being repaid in equal monthly installments that commenced on october  and will conclude on september  the interest rate on the term loan is libor plus per annum 
at august   we had million remaining on the term loan and a zero balance on our revolving loan 
during the majority of fiscal we did not draw on our available revolving loan 
at august   the effective interest rate on the term loan was percent and the effective interest rate on our revolving loan was percent 
the second modification agreement requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including a a funded debt to ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rental expense ratio of less than to  b a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than to  and c an annual limit on capital expenditures not including capitalized curriculum development of million 
the previously existing minimum net worth covenant was eliminated 
in the event of noncompliance with the financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lender is entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of amounts outstanding on the term loan and the revolving loan 
at august   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants applicable to the restated credit agreement and its subsequent modifications 
we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants in the foreseeable future 
in addition to our million revolving loan and term loan obligation  we have a long term lease on our corporate campus that expires in and is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities remained generally consistent with the prior year and totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  the slight decrease was primarily due to the use 
table of contents of cash to support working capital needs  including a significant increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased sales during august the use of cash for working capital needs was partially offset by improved operating results during fiscal compared with the prior year 
our primary source of cash from operating activities in fiscal was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures our business is not generally considered capital intensive and we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
our uses of cash for investing activities include the purchases of computer hardware  software  and other equipment used in the normal course of business  curriculum development  and potential contingent earnout payments resulting from the acquisition of other business entities 
during fiscal we used million of net cash for investing activities 
for the fiscal year ending august   we spent million on property and equipment  which primarily consisted of computer hardware purchases  leasehold improvements primarily on office space at our corporate campus that we lease to other entities  and computer software purchases 
during fiscal we spent million on the development of new curriculums  including our new productivity course  the choices to extraordinary productivity  which was launched in the fall of we were not required to pay a contingent earnout payment in fiscal related to the acquisition of coveylink  but we may need to pay contingent earnout amounts in future periods based on the results of coveylink operations 
during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during the fiscal year ended august  totaled million 
our uses of cash for financing activities primarily consisted of million used for payments on our term loan obligation  million used for principal payments on our financing obligation  and million used to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of cash received from participants in the employee stock purchase plan to purchase shares of our common stock 
during the third quarter of fiscal we announced the approval of a plan to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we intend to use cash in excess of million  provided we have no balance outstanding on our revolving loan  for the purchases 
during fiscal  we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under this plan 
we anticipate that the purchases of our common stock under this approved plan will increase the use of cash for financing activities in future periods provided that we maintain adequate liquidity to allow for the purchases 
sources of liquidity we expect to meet our projected capital expenditures  service our existing financing obligation and term loan  and meet other working capital requirements during fiscal through current cash balances and future cash flows from operating activities 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day to day operation and potential growth of the business and may use our available revolving loan and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we extended the maturity date on our revolving loan during fiscal to march and expect to renew the revolving loan on an annual basis to maintain the three year availability of this credit facility 
additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include factoring receivables  issuance of additional equity  or issuance of debt from public or private sources 
if necessary  we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital 

table of contents considering the foregoing  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  macroeconomic activity  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as general economic conditions and the introduction of new curriculums and technology by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  as described above  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations we have not structured any special purpose entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  payments to hp enterprise services hp for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  minimum operating lease payments primarily for domestic regional and foreign office space  the repayment of our term loan obligation  which matures in fiscal  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum required payments to hp for outsourcing services minimum operating lease payments term loan purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
we are also contractually allowed to collect amounts from fc organizational products  the impact of which would reduce the amounts shown in the table above 
the operating agreement with fc organizational products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which would reduce the lease obligations disclosed in the table above 
amount includes estimated interest at percent  which was the effective rate on the term loan at august  our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 

table of contents other items fc organizational products is contractually obligated to pay us for rented warehouse and office space  a portion of the fixed costs for warehousing and distribution facilities  and is primarily liable for leasing costs at its retail stores 
as of august  we remain secondarily liable for million of retail store leasing costs  most of which will be paid by february in the event that fc organizational products is unable to pay these items  our liquidity  cash flows  and operating results may be adversely affected 
the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are primarily outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
products we sell books  audio media  training accessories  and other related products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple element deliverables that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance for multiple element arrangements using the relative selling price method 

table of contents our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of their sales to clients 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to us from our licensees 
international royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated income statements 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation our shareholders have approved a performance based long term incentive plan ltip that provides for grants of share based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as directed by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the number of common shares that are vested and issued to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of specified financial performance objectives during a defined performance period 
due to the variable number of common shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate our ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the company compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon the estimated probable number of common shares to be awarded 
the analysis of our ltip awards contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and the corresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we record cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants as described above 
during prior fiscal years we have also granted share based compensation awards that have a share price  or market based  vesting conditions 
as a result  we used a monte carlo simulation to determine the fair value and expected term of these awards 
the monte carlo pricing models required the input of subjective assumptions  including items such as the expected term of the options 
if factors change  and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense related to future awards  our share based compensation expense may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectability of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectability assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by approximately million 
for further information regarding the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  refer to the notes to our financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 

table of contents related party receivable at august   we had receivables from fc organizational products  an entity in which we own percent  for reimbursement of certain operating costs  such as warehousing and distribution costs  which are billed to us by third party providers  and for working capital and other advances that we made during fiscal  even though we are not obligated to provide advances to  or fund the losses of fcop 
we make use of estimates to account for these receivables  including estimates of the collectability of amounts receivable from fcop in future periods and  based upon revisions to the timing of estimated collections in fiscal  we were required to classify a portion of the receivable from current to long term at august  in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  we were required to discount the long term portion of the receivables to its net present value using an estimated effective borrowing rate for fcop 
we estimated the effective risk adjusted borrowing rate to discount the long term portion of the receivable at percent  which was recorded as a discount on a related party receivable in our fiscal statement of operations 
our estimate of the effective borrowing rate required us to estimate a variety of factors  including the availability of debt financing for fcop  projected borrowing rates for comparable debt  and the timing and realizability of projected cash flows from fcop 
these estimates were based on information known at the time of the preparation of these financial statements 
a change in the assumptions and factors used  including estimated interest rates  may change the amount of discount taken 
for instance  a one percent increase in the discount rate would have reduced our income before income taxes by million in fiscal our assessments regarding the collectability of the fcop receivable requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the financial health of fcop and are dependent on projected financial information for fcop in future periods 
such financial information contains inherent uncertainties  and is subject to factors that are not within our control 
failure to receive projected cash flows from fcop in future periods may result in adverse consequences to our liquidity  financial position  and results of operations 
for further information regarding our investment in fcop  refer to the notes to our financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 
inventory valuation our inventories are primarily comprised of training materials and related accessories 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory valuation reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory valuation calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory valuation methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have an adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for example  a percent increase to our inventory valuation reserves at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by million 
indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset was generated by the merger with the covey leadership center and has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is 
table of contents quantitatively tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and international licensee royalties 
our goodwill at august  was generated by the acquisition of coveylink worldwide  llc during fiscal and the subsequent payment of the first two of five possible contingent annual earnout payments as required in the acquisition agreement due to operating results during the third annual earnout measurement period  no payment was required during fiscal 
our impairment evaluation calculations for goodwill and the covey trade name contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to qualitatively assess the fair value of these assets  and may require estimated future cash flows  an estimated appropriate royalty rate  and an estimated discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows when these assets are evaluated on a quantitative basis 
our quantitative valuation methodology for the covey trade name has remained unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the valuation methodologies for both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are also dependent upon the share price of our common stock and our corresponding market capitalization  which may differ from estimated royalties used in our impairment testing 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name and goodwill  our trade name related revenues  licensee royalties  and overall sales levels would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair them 
however  future declines in our share price may trigger additional impairment testing and may result in impairment charges 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
although we have not made any material recent changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
we account for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of fasc formerly fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the 
table of contents provisions of fasc also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and require increased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
we record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  we consider all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether valuation allowances are needed on our deferred income tax assets contains uncertainties because we must project future income  including the use of tax planning strategies  by individual tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry and economic conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are necessary 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on sales made in these jurisdictions 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  including paper and related raw materials 
we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers

these  and other forward looking statements  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in reports filed by us with the sec  including reports on forms k  q  and k 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed in item a of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended august   entitled risk factors

the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors may emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any single factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the price of our common stock can change for reasons unrelated to our performance 
due to our low market capitalization  the price of our common stock may also be affected by conditions such as a lack of analyst coverage and fewer potential investors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we may make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and thus are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 

table of contents additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we may make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which may include the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal year ended august  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expired on a quarterly basis  were recognized in current operations and were used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
during fiscal our losses on these contracts totaled million 
we did not have any open derivative instruments outstanding at august interest rate sensitivity at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility  our revolving loan a variable rate line of credit arrangement  and a variable rate term loan that is payable in monthly installments over months 
during fiscal  we benefitted from extraordinarily low interest rates on our revolving loan and term loan borrowings 
our overall interest rate sensitivity is therefore primarily influenced by amounts borrowed on the revolving loan and the term loan and the prevailing interest rates on these instruments  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent 
the term loan  on which we borrowed million  had an effective interest rate of percent at august  our revolving loan had a zero balance at august  at august  borrowing levels  a one percent increase in the interest rate on our variable rate credit obligations would have an insignificant impact on our interest expense over the next fiscal year 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
