item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our profitability is highly dependent on our net interest income  mortgage banking income  the provision for loan losses and expenses related to real estate owned 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earnings assets which are loans receivable  investment securities and cash and cash equivalents and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
the bank is primarily a mortgage lender with loans secured by real estate comprising of total loans receivable on december  further  of loans receivable are residential mortgage loans with over four family loans comprising of all loans on december  waterstone bank funds loan production primarily with retail deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
the bank s mortgage banking subsidiary  waterstone mortgage corporation  utilizes a line of credit provided by the bank as its primary source of funding loans held for sale 
in addition  waterstone mortgage corporation utilizes lines of credit with external banks as necessary 
on december   deposits comprised of total liabilities 
time deposits  also known as certificates of deposit  accounted for of total deposits at december  federal home loan bank advances outstanding on december  totaled million  or of total liabilities 
during the current prolonged period of low interest rates and economic weakness  we have determined that an investment philosophy emphasizing short term liquid investments is prudent and positions the company to take advantage of the investment  lending and interest rate risk management opportunities that will exist as the local and national economies recover from the recession 
our high level of time deposits  relative to total deposits  may result in an increase in our cost of funds when market interest rates begin to increase 
during the year ended december   our results of operations continued to be adversely affected by elevated levels of nonperforming loans and real estate owned 
weaknesses in our loan portfolio have required that we establish higher provisions for loan losses and incur significant loan charge offs 
the continued downturn in the local real estate market requires the company to continually re evaluate the inputs and assumptions used to determine the fair value of collateral and net present value of discounted future estimated cash flows related to loans receivable to ensure that the allowance for loan losses continues to be an accurate reflection of management s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable and estimable loss on impaired loans and other incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
as a result  the company determined that a provision for loan losses of million was necessary during the year ended december  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level in relation to the risks management believes are inherent and estimable in our portfolio 
additional information regarding loan quality and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations can be found in the asset quality discussion 
our results of operations are also affected by noninterest income and noninterest expense 
noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking income 
the increase in margins earned on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market yielded a million increase in mortgage banking income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits  real estate owned expense and fdic insurance premiums 
the primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense compared to the prior year relates to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations 
of the million increase in noninterest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   million relates to our mortgage banking operations 
real estate owned expense increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to an increase in properties under management and an increase in write downs of asset values  which is reflective of a strategy to become more aggressive in pricing specific properties to expedite the sale process 
during our noninterest expense has been and will continue to be adversely affected by elevated deposit insurance premium assessments from the fdic 
fdic insurance premium expense totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general and local economic and competitive conditions  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
allowance for loan losses 
waterstone bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that waterstone bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral specific component 
the company recognizes the change in present value of expected future cash flows on impaired loans attributable to the passage of time as bad debt expense 
on an ongoing basis  at least quarterly for financial reporting purposes  the fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans and real estate owned is determined or reaffirmed by the following procedures obtaining updated real estate appraisals or performing updated discounted cash flow analysis  confirming that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date  comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated sales values experienced on similar real estate owned  comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated values seen on more current appraisals of similar properties  and comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated listed sales prices on our real estate owned and that of similar properties not owned by the company 
waterstone bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio general component 
the risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience  the level of non performing and classified assets  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  regulatory guidance  and other relevant factors 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged off loans and reduced by charge offs 
charge offs approximate the amount by which the outstanding principal balance exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the waterstone bank board of directors 
the allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the waterstone bank board of directors 
actual results could differ from this estimate  and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions 
more specifically  if our future charge off experience increases substantially from our past experience  or if the value of underlying loan collateral  in our case real estate  declines in value by a substantial amount  or if unemployment in our primary market area increases significantly  our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate and we will incur higher provisions for loan losses and lower net income in the future 
in addition  state and federal regulators periodically review the waterstone bank allowance for loan losses 
such regulators have the authority to require waterstone bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination 
income taxes 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at both december  and december   the company determined a valuation allowance continued to be necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during those three years 
in addition  general uncertainty regarding the economy and the housing market has increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
positions taken in the company s tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement 
management believes the company s tax policies and practices are critical because the determination of the tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact on our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we have no plans to change the tax recognition methodology in the future without hard evidence of sustainable earnings trends which are reliant on net interest income  mortgage banking income and significantly reduced credit losses 
if the estimated valuation allowance against our deferred asset is adjusted it will affect our future net income 
fair value measurements 
the company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with asc asc establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under gaap 
a number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the company s financial statements 
the valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities  appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates  and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors 
therefore  the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the income statement under the framework established by gaap 
comparison of financial condition at december  and at december total assets 
total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total assets reflects decreases in loans receivable of million 
funds received upon the repayment of loans held in portfolio were utilized to pay down million in time deposits 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the company s decision to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on securities and other investments 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase reflects a million increase in government sponsored enterprise bonds a million increase in municipal securities and a million increase in certificates of deposit  partially offset by million decrease in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the shift in the composition of the securities portfolio towards less volatile  shorter term debt securities reflects a decision to increase portfolio liquidity 
as of december   the company holds two available for sale private label issue collateralized mortgage obligations with a total fair value of million and an amortized cost of million that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the million unrealized loss before taxes is included in other comprehensive income 
during the year ended december    was recognized as additional other than temporary impairment with respect to one of the private label issue collateralized mortgage obligations which was charged against earnings 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale decreased by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  during the latter half of fiscal  waterstone mortgage corporation capitalized on its branch expansion and low interest rate environment to significantly increase its loan origination activity 
this origination activity resulted in a historically high level of loans held for sale as of december  loans receivable 
loans receivable held for investment decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total loans receivable was primarily attributable to an million decrease in one to four family loans  a million decrease in home equity loans and an million decrease in construction and land loans 
the decrease in one to four family loans reflects a decline in loan demand for variable rate real estate mortgage loans as recent borrowers have preferred long term fixed rate products that the company does not generally retain in its portfolio 
the decrease in construction and land loans reflects a strategy to reduce exposure to this segment of the portfolio 
decreases in loan balances in these and other categories also reflect an overall decrease in demand due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
as a result of the low interest rate environment with respect to long term fixed rate real estate mortgage products  the company has experienced a shift in the composition of loan originations during and from one to four family residential variable rate loans to residential real estate loans collateralized by over four family properties and commercial real estate  as these categories of borrowers displayed relatively stable levels of demand for our existing products 
during the year ended december   million in loans were transferred to real estate owned and million were charged off  net of recoveries 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan loss during the year ended december  is attributable to a million increase in specific loan loss reserves related to impaired loans and a million increase in the general valuation allowance 
the million increase in specific loan loss reserves was primarily the result of collateral shortfalls pertaining to a relatively small number of lending relationships that were identified as impaired during the year ended december  the reserves established with respect to these loans resulted in an overall increase in specific reserves  despite a decrease in the overall level of impaired loans during the year ended december  the increase in the general valuation allowance resulted from an increase in loans that  while they may still be performing have been identified as having higher risk characteristics 
during the year ended december   the increase in the amount and number of loans identified as exhibiting elevated levels of risk with respect to loss outweighed the decline in non accrual loans 
loans with elevated risk profiles include loans internally classified as substandard 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was and was equal to of non performing loans  compared to and  respectively  at december  of the overall million increase in the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december   million related to the one to four family category and an additional million related to the over four family category 
weakness in the residential real estate market has continued for the past four years and the risk of loss on loans secured by residential real estate remains at an elevated level 
that portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to mortgage loans secured by residential real estate has increased slightly to of the total allowance for loan losses at december  compared to at december  real estate owned 
total real estate owned decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   million was transferred from loans to real estate owned upon completion of foreclosure 
declines in property values evidenced by updated appraisals  responses to list prices on properties held for sale and or deterioration in the condition of properties resulted in write downs totaling million during the year ended december  during the same period  sales of real estate owned totaled million 
prepaid expenses and other assets 
prepaid expenses and other assets declined by million or  to million at december  from million at december  the decline is primarily due to a decrease in receivables due from third parties related to the origination of loans held for sale 
deposits 
total deposits decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the overall reduction in deposits primarily reflects a decrease in time deposits 
during calendar  proceeds received from the loan principal pay downs were primarily utilized to maintain a higher than normal level of liquidity 
as an adequate level of liquidity has been achieved  the company has responded to additional reductions in the loan portfolio by allowing for strategic runoff of time deposits 
total time deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  time deposits originated through local retail outlets decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  time deposits originated through the wholesale market decreased million  or  to  at december  from million at december  due to the consent order issued by state and federal regulators effective december   the bank is prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and all other deposit interest rates are capped by the fdic 
total money market and savings deposits increased  or  to million at december  from million at december  total demand deposits increased  or  to million at december  from million at december borrowings 
total borrowings increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in borrowings relates entirely to an increase in the use of bank lines of credit to finance loans held for sale 
the balance of these lines of credit increased by million  to million at december   from million at december  shareholders equity 
shareholders equity decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in stockholders equity was primarily due to a million decrease in retained earnings reflecting the net loss for the year ended december  the decrease in retained earnings was partially offset by a  increase in additional paid in capital related to stock compensation benefits and an  decrease in unearned esop shares and a  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
average balance sheets  interest and yields costs the following tables set forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information for the periods indicated 
no tax equivalent yield adjustments were made  as the effect thereof was not material 
all average balances are daily average balances

net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets 
average balance of available for sale securities is based on amortized historical cost 
interest income from tax exempt securities is not significant to total interest income  therefore  interest and yield on interest earnings assets are not stated on a tax equivalent basis

segment review 
as described in note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s primary reportable segment is community banking 
community banking consists of lending and deposit gathering as well as other banking related products and services to consumers and businesses and the support to deliver  fund  and manage such banking services 
the company s mortgage banking segment provides residential mortgage products for the purpose of sale on the secondary market 
the company s results of operations are dominated by net interest income  the level of the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense of its community banking segment 
the consolidated discussion  therefore  predominantly describes the community banking segment results 
mortgage banking segment assets which consist predominantly of loans held for sale decreased million  or  to million as of december  compared to million as of december  additional details are provided in the loans held for sale section 
the million increase in mortgage banking revenues from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was attributable to increased margins on the sale of loans held for sale 
the major components of mortgage banking revenues include fees and premiums associated with the sale of residential loans held for sale  which are discussed in section mortgage banking income 
the major expenses for the mortgage banking segment are compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits  as well as occupancy  office furniture and equipment and other expenses  which are covered generally in the consolidated discussion in section noninterest expense 
total interest income 
total interest income decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans also reflects a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income from mortgage related securities decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage related securities to for the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income from mortgage related securities also reflects a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decline in the average balance of mortgage related securities during the year ended december  reflects management s decision to deemphasize investments in mortgage related securities and emphasize more liquid  less volatile  government agency and municipal securities 
finally  interest income from other interest earning assets comprised of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period in the decline in average yield provided by these assets reflects the lower overall interest rate environment as opposed to a shift in investment strategy and product mix 
the decrease in interest income due to a decline in average yield was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in average balance reflects a strategic shift towards investments which provide higher levels of liquidity 
the company intends to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on loans and mortgage related securities 
total interest expense 
total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease of basis points in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average cost of funds as well as a decrease of million  or  in average interest bearing deposits and borrowings outstanding to billion for the year ended december  compared to an average balance of billion for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in the cost of average deposits of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of deposits reflects the low interest rate environment due to the federal reserve s low short term interest rate policy 
these rates are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposit products 
the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was compounded by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  during the year ended december   proceeds received from the loan principal pay downs were primarily utilized to maintain a higher than normal level of liquidity 
consistent with the bank s liquidity needs and funding obligations the bank has reduced its level of higher cost time deposits during the year ended december  interest expense on borrowings decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in the decrease resulted from a million  or  decrease in average borrowings outstanding to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average balance as well as a decrease in the cost of borrowings of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decreased use of borrowings as a source of funding during the year ended december  reflects our decision to utilize core deposits as our primary funding source 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a reduction in the loan portfolio during the year and a change in the composition of interest earning assets that became more weighted towards lower yielding other earning assets during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in time deposits and borrowings during the year ended december provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remains at high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which when applied to the portfolio in general require higher loan loss provisions 
they also result in more loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience rates 
these risk characteristics include reduced borrower cash flow  reduced borrower fico scores and known declines in collateral value even though the loan may still be performing 
the provision for the year ended december  reflects million of net loan charge offs combined with continued weakness in local real estate markets which required an overall increase to the allowance for loan losses 
see the asset quality section for an analysis of charge offs  nonperforming assets  specific reserves and additional provisions 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the increase resulted primarily from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in the million increase in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of an increase in average sales margin which was driven by the following factors an increase in pricing on all products in all geographic markets  a change in product mix towards real estate purchase loans which yield a higher margin than loans originated for the purpose of a refinancing and change in the geographic composition of origination activity towards higher yielding geographic markets 
despite the increase in pricing  overall loan origination volumes remained relatively consistent which reflects the continued strong demand for fixed rate loans due in large part to historically low interest rates on these products 
while the loan origination volume remained relatively consistent during the years ended december  and  there was a shift in the mix of loan purpose toward loans originated for the purpose of a residential property purchase  which yield a higher return  as opposed to a loan originated for the purpose of refinancing an existing mortgage loan 
during the year ended december   approximately of all loans were originated for purchase and were originated to refinance an existing loan 
during the year ended december   approximately of all loans were originated for purchase and were originated to refinance an existing loan 
in addition to the shift in product mix during the year ended december   there was a shift in origination volume by geographic market 
loan origination volumes increased by a combined million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  with respect to three of our higher yielding geographic markets 
in addition  during the same time frame  loan origination volumes decreased by approximately million in one of our lower yielding geographic markets 
while margins increased in all markets  this shift in origination volumes by market  resulted in higher average margins during the year ended december  noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation  real estate owned expense and other noninterest expense 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in compensation is primarily the result of an increase in commissions paid to loan originators by our mortgage banking subsidiary and correlates to the increase in mortgage banking income 
loan commissions increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  real estate owned expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in real estate owned expense includes the net operating and carrying costs related to the properties 
in addition  it includes net gain or loss recognized upon the sale of a foreclosed property  as well as write downs recognized to maintain the properties at their estimated fair value 
the increase in real estate owned expense results from an increase in properties under management and an increase in write downs of asset values  which is reflective of a strategy to become more aggressive in pricing specific properties to expedite the sale process 
during the year ended december   net operating expense  which includes but is not limited to property taxes  maintenance and management fees  net of rental income increased  or  to million from million during the year ended december  the increase in net operating expense compared to the prior period resulted from an increase in the number of properties owned 
the average balance of real estate owned totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses recognized on write down of real estate owned net of net gains on sales totaled million during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  other noninterest expense increased or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in the increase resulted from an increase in operational costs related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations to million for the year ended december  from million during income taxes 
despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  tax expense is comprised of current estimated expense of million resulting from an irs audit of tax years through which is still in progress  plus current estimated state income tax expense of  related to mortgage banking operations apportioned to states in which taxes are based on separate company operations partially offset by current income tax benefit of  for an intra period tax allocation between other comprehensive income and loss from continuing operations  and represents an out of period adjustment for an error that originated beginning in that was corrected during the quarter ended june  the correction of the error was not material to the years ended december  or despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  primarily due to differences between prior year estimates and actual tax returns filed plus state income tax due to taxable income generated by the mortgage banking subsidiary 
due to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net loss for the year ended december  totaled million  or for both basic and diluted loss per share  compared to net loss of million  or for both basic and diluted loss per share  for the year ended december  the year ended december  generated a loss on average assets of and a loss on average equity of  compared to a loss on average assets of and a loss on average equity of for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  reflected continuing deterioration in asset quality in a weak economic environment which resulted in a million provision for loan losses in the decrease in the net loss for the year ended december  reflected a million increase in net interest income  a million increase in pre tax income from our mortgage banking operations  a million decrease in other than temporary impairment investment loss  and  reduction in provisions for loan losses  partially offset by a million reduction in income tax benefit 
loan charge off activity and specific loan reserves are discussed in additional detail in the asset quality section 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  total interest income 
total interest income decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in the average balance of loans reflect an overall decrease in demand due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
the decrease in interest income attributable to the decrease in average balance was compounded by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income from mortgage related securities decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income attributable to the decrease in average balance was compounded by a decrease in average yield 
the average yield on mortgage related securities decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in the average balance of mortgage related securities during the year ended december  reflects management s decision to deemphasize investments in mortgage related securities and emphasize more liquid  less volatile  government agency securities 
finally  interest income from debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in average yield provided by these assets reflects the lower overall interest rate environment as opposed to a shift in investment strategy and product mix 
the decrease in average rate was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in average balance reflects a strategic shift towards higher levels of liquidity 
the company intends to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on loans and mortgage related securities 
the average balance of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments includes fhlbc stock of million for each of the years ended december  and on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the federal housing finance board 
on february   the fhlbc declared its first dividend since it entered into the cease and desist order 
total interest expense 
total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of basis points in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average cost of funds as well as a decrease of million  or  in average interest bearing deposits and borrowings outstanding to billion for the year ended december  compared to an average balance of billion for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was compounded by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of deposits reflects the federal reserve s historically low short term interest rate policy 
these rates are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposit products 
the decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a million decline in average non local or brokered deposits 
the average balance of brokered deposits totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a million  or  decrease in average borrowings outstanding to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in the decrease due to average balance was partially offset by a basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings to during the year ended december  from during the comparable period in the decreased use of borrowings as a source of funding during the year ended december  reflects our decision to utilize core deposits as our primary funding source 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  net interest income continues to be positively affected by lower short and medium term interest rates in  as compared to the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a basis point increase in our interest rate spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the basis point increase in the interest rate spread resulted from a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in net interest income resulting from an increase in our net interest rate spread was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income resulting from a change in the composition of interest earning assets 
while net interest earning assets increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million from the year ended december   the composition of interest earning assets shifted from loans to debt securities and short term investments  which yield a lower return 
the shift from loans towards debt securities and short term investments reflects an overall decrease in demand for loan products due to current economic conditions combined with the company s more stringent loan underwriting requirements 
the change in composition also reflects a strategic shift towards higher levels of liquidity 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remained at historically high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which when applied to the portfolio in general require higher loan loss provisions 
they also result in more loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience rates 
these risk characteristics include reduced borrower global cash flow  reduced borrower fico scores and known declines in collateral value even though the loan may still be performing 
the provision for the year ended december  was the result of million of net loan charge offs combined with continued weakness in local real estate markets which required an overall increase to the allowance for loan losses 
see the asset quality section for an analysis of charge offs  nonperforming assets  specific reserves and additional provisions 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the comparable period in in addition to the increase in mortgage banking activity  the increase in noninterest income compared to the prior period resulted from an million decrease in impairment charge on securities considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was the combined result of increased volume  increased sales margins  expansion of the branch network and the addition of mandatory loan delivery terms 
during the year ended december   mortgage banking expanded from to branch locations outside of the bank branch network 
new branches were added in illinois  maryland  north carolina  colorado  florida and minnesota 
volume and margin changes account for million  or  of the million increase in mortgage banking income year over year 
the volume of loans sold during increased by million  or  to billion in from million in in addition  the average sales margin increased by basis points to in from in this combination accounted for million  or  of the total volume and margin change in mortgage banking income 
the remaining million increase in mortgage banking income due to volume and margin changes relates directly to the increase in processing income 
the branch expansion noted above was the primary driver in the volume increase over the prior year 
volume at the new branches added during the year ended december  totaled million  which represented of the total increase in volume for the year 
improvement in sales margins were attributable to an increase in higher margin government guaranteed loans  an increase in loans for the purchase of residential real estate and an increase in volume in higher margin markets around the country 
in  government guaranteed loans accounted for of total mortgage banking volume  up from in the average sales margin on government guaranteed loans was basis points higher than that on conventional mortgage loans 
also in  loans for the purchase of residential real estate accounted for of total mortgage banking volume  up from in the average sales margin on loans for the purchase of real estate was basis points higher than that on loan refinances 
sales margins vary from market to market around the country 
there was a basis point spread between the company s highest margin branch and its lowest margin branch during the year ended december  during sales volumes increased at high margin branches in minnesota  arizona and maryland 
branches in these three states produced of the million increase in volume for as compared to the minnesota branches accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher the company s weighted average sales margin 
the arizona branch accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher than the company s weighted average sales margin 
the maryland branch accounted for million in increased volume during with a sales margin that was basis points higher than the company s weighted average sales margin 
branches are operated on a net branch basis whereby predetermined margins and direct expenses are paid by the branch office to the corporate office and remaining net income accrues to the branch manager 
successful branches generate higher levels of revenue and expense with an eye toward increasing branch manager net income 
branch income accounts for million  or  of the increase in mortgage banking income for over the prior year 
this increase in mortgage banking income is offset by increases in mortgage banking expenses distributed among the noninterest expense categories of the income statement 
a full of this increase  or million  is offset by branch manager payroll which increased to million in from million in and is included in compensation  payroll taxes  and other employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to  the company originated loans held for sale on a best efforts delivery basis 
under the best efforts delivery method  the buyer of the loan  or investor  assumed all interest rate risk 
just prior to the end of  the company began to originate loans for sale on a mandatory delivery basis 
under the mandatory delivery method  the investor committed to buy only those loans that were originated within a specified yield to the buyer 
higher fees are paid by the investor to the originator for mandatory delivery as compared to best efforts delivery in exchange for the assumption of interest rate risk 
mortgage banking income increased by million in over as a result of loans sold on a mandatory delivery method net of hedging gains and losses 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and other operating expenses 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  total full time equivalent employees increased by  or  to at december  from at december  due to an expansion of our mortgage banking operations 
total compensation  payroll taxes and other benefits at our mortgage banking subsidiary increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  this increase in expense is directly related to the increase in mortgage banking income for year ended december  compared to december  the million increase in mortgage banking compensation  payroll taxes and benefits was comprised of an million increase in commissions paid to loan officers  a million increase in branch manager compensation  a million increase in administrative payroll and a million increase in payroll taxes and benefits 
other noninterest expense increased million or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in other noninterest expense is a direct result of the increase in operational costs related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations 
income taxes 
despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  primarily due to differences between prior year estimates and actual tax returns filed plus state income tax due to taxable income generated by the mortgage banking subsidiary 
due to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of federal and wisconsin tax law changes enacted during in the first quarter a wisconsin state tax law change was enacted with retroactive effect to january  requiring combined filing in wisconsin 
we recognized a state benefit in connection with the establishment of a wisconsin deferred tax asset which does not require a valuation allowance related to the unrealized loss on securities available for sale owned by the company s nevada subsidiary 
in addition  we recognized a federal tax benefit as a result of legislation passed in the fourth quarter of allowing for a one time carry back of tax losses for up to five years 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
liquidity and capital resources we maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs 
our liquidity ratio averaged and for the years ended december  and the liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments  repay our borrowings  fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
the operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the chief financial officer as supported by the full asset liability committee 
liquidity is monitored on a daily  weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators 
regulatory liquidity  as required by the wisconsin department of financial institutions  is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month s average deposits and short term borrowings 
minimum primary liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank s primary and total regulatory liquidity at december  were and  respectively 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  repayment of loans  sales of loans held for sale  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and the origination and sale of loans held for sale are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competitors 
however  effective march   our deposit rates were capped by the fdic as a result of the consent order issued by federal and state regulators 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
additional sources of liquidity for the purpose of managing long and short term cash flows include advances from the fhlbc 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans  proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage related securities  increases in deposit accounts  federal funds purchased and advances from the fhlbc 
on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases and redemptions  including redemptions upon membership withdrawal or other termination  are prohibited unless the fhlbc has received approval of the director of the office of supervision of the federal housing finance board os director 
the order also provides that dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the os director 
we currently hold  at cost  million of fhlbc stock  all of which we believe we will ultimately be able to recover 
during  the fhlbc received authorization to resume dividend payments to its members and received authorization to initiate an excess stock repurchase plan 
subject to a quarterly assessment of the fhlbc s capacity to repurchase  the stock repurchase plan will allow for the repurchase of member bank s excess stock that they no longer wish to hold 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december   and  loan repayments net of loan originations generated positive cash flows of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in loans receivable is reflective of the general decline in loan demand for variable rate residential real estate mortgage loans combined with the company s tightened underwriting standards given the current economic conditions 
cash received from the calls  maturities and principal repayments of debt and mortgage related securities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchased million  million and million in debt and mortgage related securities classified as available for sale during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we sold million  million and  in available for sale debt and mortgage related securities during the years ended december   and  respectively 
deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates  market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors 
the net decrease in deposits was million during the year ended december  this compares to a net decrease in deposits of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as a result of the consent order issued by state and federal regulators effective december   the bank is prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and all other deposit rates are capped by the fdic 
liquidity management is both a daily and longer term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlbc  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in fixed rate advances from the fhlbc  of which none were due within months  but all of which are putable at the option of the fhlbc 
the weighted average rate on these advances was as of december  at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and unfunded commitments under construction loans  lines of credit and standby letters of credit of million 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us  we will have to utilize other funding sources  such as fhlbc advances or the federal reserve discount window to maintain our level of assets 
however  such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  if and when needed 
alternatively  we would reduce our level of liquid assets  such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs 
in addition  the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal

future accounting pronouncements new accounting policies adopted by the company during are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted are discussed below 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of this financial review and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this information will enable users of an entity s financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   with retrospective application to the disclosures of all comparative periods presented 
the company will adopt the accounting standard during  as required  and is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued amendments intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under the guidance  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this accounting standard will not have an impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued guidance to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  with retrospective application 
the company will adopt the accounting standard during  as required  with no expected material impact on its results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
subsequently  in december  the fasb decided that the requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred 
therefore  those requirements will not be effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  in may  the fasb issued guidance on measuring fair value to create common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments also clarify the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company will adopt the accounting standard during  as required  and is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of waterstone bank have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
quarterly financial information the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the periods indicated quarter ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data unaudited interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses total noninterest income total noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss income loss per share basic income loss per share diluted unaudited interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses total noninterest income total noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss income loss per share basic income loss per share diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  waterstone bank s board of directors has established an asset liability committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset liability committee meets at least weekly to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which are evaluated quarterly 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one to four family  and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans  ii reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio  and iii whenever possible  lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the fhlbc 
these measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments 
income simulation 
simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
at least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a negative impact on net interest income and earnings 
percentage increase decrease in estimated net annual interest income over months basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates unchanged rate scenario basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates waterstone bank s asset liability policy limits projected changes in net average annual interest income to a maximum decline of for various levels of interest rate changes measured over a month period when compared to the flat rate scenario 
in addition  projected changes in the economic value of equity are limited to a maximum decline of for interest rate movements of up to basis points when compared to the flat rate scenario 
these limits are re evaluated on a periodic basis and may be modified  as appropriate 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of increasing forecast net interest income by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of increasing net interest income by 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of decreasing the economic value of equity by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of increasing the economic value of equity by 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
