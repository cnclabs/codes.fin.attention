as discussed in item selected financial data  us gaap requires the company to carry derivatives at fair value but physical commodities inventory at the lower of cost or fair value 
these requirements may have a significant temporary impact on our reported earnings 
under us gaap  gains and losses on commodities inventory and derivatives which the company intends to be offsetting are often recognized in different periods 
additionally  in certain circumstances  us gaap does not require us to reflect changes in estimated values of forward commitments to purchase and sell commodities 
for these reasons  management primarily assesses the company s operating results on a marked to market basis 
management relies on these adjusted operating results to evaluate the performance of the company s commodities business segment and its personnel  as

recent events affecting the financial services industry on october   mf global holdings ltd 
mf global  the parent company of the jointly registered futures commission merchant and broker dealer  mf global inc  filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
following the bankruptcy filing  the cme group inc selected our wholly owned subsidiary  fcstone  llc  as one of a number of fcm s chosen to receive blocks of mf global customers 
during this process  fcstone  llc opened accounts for the customers of these introducing brokers and completed the transfer of their positions 
in conjunction with the block transfer and during the subsequent period  the company has opened over  new accounts for former mf global customers 
in addition  on november   the company arranged with the administrator of mf global s uk operations to acquire the metals division of mf global uk limited in special administration 
the company has hired more than professional staff based in london  new york  and sydney from this metals trading business based in london 
this business serves institutional investors and financial services firms in the americas  europe and the asia pacific region 
following this transaction  intl fcstone europe received approval from the london metals exchange lme to upgrade its lme category two membership to a lme category one ring dealing membership 
at the time of the mf global bankruptcy filing  mf global notified the commodity futures trading commission the cftc of potential deficiencies in customer segregated futures accounts held at mf global inc in addition  on july  the cftc took action to freeze the assets of peregrine financial group pfg  a futures commission merchant  following the discovery of potential deficiencies in customer segregated futures accounts at pfg 
the cftc has extensive regulations to provide for the safety and security of customer assets on deposit with fcms 
these regulations require that all fcms maintain customer segregated assets in qualified depositories in excess of its customer segregated liabilities 
fcm s are required to complete a daily calculation of these excess segregated assets as well as their net capital positions and are required to file a cftc form fr on a monthly basis 
following these industry events  the nfa  cftc and cme have enacted additional regulations designed to safeguard customer assets on deposit with fcms including semi monthly segregated investment detail reports  direct electronic confirmations of segregated balances held at depositories and additional filing requirements involving disbursements made out of customer segregated accounts 
in addition  the cftc enacted changes to the rules governing the acceptable investment of customer segregated assets by removing investments in the general obligations of a sovereign nation and repurchase transactions with affiliated entities from the category of otherwise allowable securities 
fcstone  llc primarily invests the segregated assets of customers in us treasury bills and money market mutual funds 
as of september   fcstone  llc maintained million in segregated assets in excess of its segregated liabilities 
as more fully discussed in the item business section of this report under the heading government regulation and exchange membership  on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act created a comprehensive new regulatory regime governing the otc and listed derivatives markets and their participants by requiring  among other things centralized clearing of standardized derivatives with certain stated exceptions  the trading of clearable derivatives on swap execution facilities or exchanges  and registration and comprehensive regulation of new categories of market participants as swap dealers and swap introducing brokers 
the cftc s and sec s joint final rule defining swap dealers and major swap participants entity definitions became effective on july  the cftc s and sec s joint final rule further defining the term swap became effective on october  in a series of no action letters  dated october   the cftc delayed the compliance dates for many rules  including the registration requirements for swap dealers  rules relating to conflicts of interest  and business conduct standards 
we currently expect to register our subsidiary  intl hanley llc  as a swap dealer on december  nevertheless  because many of the rules affecting this business  including those setting capital and margin requirements  have not been finalized or fully implemented  we cannot predict with any degree of certainty how we will be affected 
the company will continue to monitor all applicable developments in the implementation of the dodd frank act 
the legislation and implementing regulations may not only affect us  but also many of our customers and counterparties 
although the original date set for completion of final rules was mid july  the cftc has announced that it will phase in its new rules through at least march

the company will incur losses if the fair value of the financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  increases subsequent to september   which might be partially or wholly offset by gains in the value of assets held as of september  the total of million and million includes a net liability of million and million for derivatives  based on their fair value as of september  and september   respectively 
in the company s foreign exchange and commodities trading business segments  the company will hold options and futures contracts resulting from market making and proprietary trading activities in the company s foreign exchange commodities trading business segment 
the company assists its customers in its commodities trading business to protect the value of their future production precious or base metals by selling them put options on an otc basis 
the company also provides its commodities trading business customers with sophisticated option products  including combinations of buying and selling puts and calls 
the company mitigates its risk by effecting offsetting options with market counterparties or through the purchase or sale of exchange traded commodities futures 
the risk mitigation of offsetting options is not within the documented hedging designation requirements of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc 
in the company s c rm segment  when transacting otc and foreign exchange contracts with our customers  our otc and foreign exchange trade desks will generally offset the customer s transaction simultaneously with one of our trading counterparties or will offset that transaction with a similar but not identical position on the exchange 
these unmatched 
table of contents transactions are intended to be short term in nature and are conducted to facilitate the most effective transaction for our customer 
derivative contracts are traded along with cash transactions because of the integrated nature of the markets for such products 
the company manages the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with its proprietary trading and market making activities in cash instruments as part of its firm wide risk management policies 
the company is a member of various commodity exchanges and clearing organizations 
under the standard membership agreement  all members are required to guarantee the performance of other members and  accordingly  in the event another member is unable to satisfy its obligations to the exchange  may be required to fund a portion of the shortfall 
our liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities we have posted as collateral at the exchanges 
however  management believes that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is remote 
accordingly  no contingent liability for these arrangements has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and  respectively 
effects of inflation because the company s assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
increases in the company s expenses  such as compensation and benefits  clearing and related expenses  occupancy and equipment rental  due to inflation  may not be readily recoverable from increasing the prices of services offered by the company 
in addition  to the extent that inflation results in rising interest rates or has other adverse effects on the financial markets and on the value of the financial instruments held in inventory  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers the most critical to the financial statements 
the company believes these estimates and assumptions can involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported and potential future results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of financial instruments and foreign currencies 
substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  cash  securities and other assets segregated under federal and other regulations  financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  financial instruments owned  and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments  which are not customer owned positions  are reflected in earnings 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in some cases  even though the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
the value of foreign currencies  including foreign currencies sold  not yet purchased  are converted into its us dollar equivalents at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the close of business at the end of the accounting period 
for foreign currency transactions completed during each reporting period  the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction is used 
the application of the valuation process for financial instruments and foreign currencies is critical because these items represent a significant portion of our total assets 
valuations for substantially all of the financial instruments held are available from independent publishers of market information 
the valuation process may involve estimates and judgments in the case of certain financial instruments with limited liquidity and otc derivatives 
given the wide availability of pricing information  the high degree of liquidity of the majority of our assets  and the relatively short periods for which they are typically held in inventory  there is insignificant sensitivity to changes in estimates and insignificant risk of changes in estimates having a material effect on our financial statements 
the basis for estimating the valuation of any financial instruments has not undergone any change 
revenue recognition 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived principally from realized and unrealized trading income in securities  derivative instruments  commodities and foreign currencies purchased or sold for our account 
realized 
table of contents and unrealized trading income is recorded on a trade date basis 
securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased and foreign currencies sold  not yet purchased  are stated at fair value with related changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected within trading gains  net in the consolidated income statements 
fee and interest income are recorded on the accrual basis and dividend income is recognized on the ex dividend date 
revenue on commodities that are purchased for physical delivery to customers and that are not readily convertible into cash is recognized at the point in time when the commodity has been shipped  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  and the following conditions have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the critical aspect of revenue recognition is recording all known transactions as of the trade date of each transaction for the financial period 
we have developed systems for each of our businesses to capture all known transactions 
recording all known transactions involves reviewing trades that occur after the financial period that relate to the financial period 
the accuracy of capturing this information is dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of data capture of the operations systems and our clearing firms 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by the relevant tax authorities 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities  such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
the consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on non recurring events  such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax law  as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes  state and local taxes  and the effects of various global income tax strategies

interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our operations  we have interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the values of financial instruments and impact interest income earned 
we generate interest income from the positive spread earned on customer deposits 
we typically invest in us treasury bills and obligations issued by government sponsored entities  reverse repurchase agreements involving us treasury bills and government obligations or aa rated money market funds 
we have an investment policy which establishes acceptable standards of credit quality and limits the amount of funds that can be invested within a particular fund and institution 
since mid  we have employed an interest rate management strategy  where we have used derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage a portion of our aggregate interest rate position 
our objective is to invest the majority of customer segregated deposits in high quality  short term investments and swap the resulting variable interest earnings into a medium term interest stream when a sufficient interest rate spread exists between the two durations  by using a strip of interest rate swaps that mature every quarter  and enable us to achieve the two year moving average of the two year swap rate
