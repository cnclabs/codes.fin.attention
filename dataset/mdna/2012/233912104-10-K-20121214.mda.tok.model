item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company continues to operate as two different businesses the traditional business  being the business of newspaper and magazine publishing and related services that the company had before when it purchased sustain  and the sustain and new dawn software businesses  which supply case management software systems and related products to courts and other justice agencies  including administrative law organizations 
in december  the company purchased all of the outstanding stock of new dawn based in logan  utah  which provides products and services similar to those of sustain to more than justice agencies in states  three us territories and two countries 
the acquisition expands the company s position in the marketplace 
during fiscal  consolidated pretax income decreased by  to  from  in the prior year  primarily resulting from the recording of the other than temporary impairment losses on investments of  and a reduction in trustee sale notice and its related service fee revenues of  partially offset by a reduction in operating costs and expenses of  and an increase in dividends and interest income of  the write down on the investment does not necessarily indicate the loss in value is permanent 
security prices may remain below cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules  even though other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover 
as a result  accounting regulations require that the company recognize other than temporary impairment losses like these in earnings rather than in accumulated comprehensive income even in instances where the company may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least its original cost and where the company possesses the ability and intent to hold the security until at least that time 
the company s traditional business segment income from operations decreased by  to  from  primarily because of the reduction in trustee sale notice and its related service fee revenues of  partially offset by the reduction in operating costs and expenses of  sustain s business segment had a pretax loss of  compared to  in the prior year period primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and a decrease in consulting and support revenues from governmental agencies  reflecting in part continuing governmental budget constraints 
comprehensive income includes net income and net unrealized gains on investments  net of taxes 
comprehensive income fiscal ended september net income net change in unrealized appreciation of investments net of taxes reclassification of other than temporary impairment losses recognized in net income net of taxes comprehensive income reportable segments traditional business sustain total fiscal revenues income loss from operations other than temporary impairment losses on investments pretax income loss income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal revenues income loss from operations pretax income loss income tax benefit expense net income loss consolidated revenues were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease of  was primarily from decreases of  in trustee sale notice and its related service fee revenues and  in circulation revenues 
although public notice advertising revenues were down compared to the prior year period  the company still continued to benefit from the large number of foreclosures in california and arizona for which public notice advertising is required by law 
sustain s information systems and services revenues decreased by  primarily because of the decrease in consulting and support revenues 
the company s revenues derived from sustain s operations constituted about of the company s total revenues for both fiscal and operating costs and expenses decreased by  to  from  total personnel costs increased by  to  primarily due to annual salary adjustments partially offset by a  reduction in expenses related to the company s management incentive plan incentive plan 
the reduction in incentive plan expenses consisted of a decrease of  in the incentive plan accrual during fiscal due to reduced projected consolidated pretax profits before this accrual versus a decrease of  in the prior year period 
other general and administrative expenses decreased by  primarily resulting from reduced professional service fees and rents 
the traditional business segment revenues are very much dependant on the number of california and arizona foreclosure notices 
the number of foreclosure notices published by the company decreased by during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
because this slowing is expected to continue  we anticipate there will be fewer foreclosure notice advertisements and declining revenues in fiscal we do not expect to experience an offsetting increase in commercial advertising as a result of this trend because of the continuing challenges in the commercial advertising business 
the company s smaller newspapers  those other than the los angeles and san francisco daily journals the daily journals  accounted for about of the total public notice advertising revenues in the twelve month period 
public notice advertising revenues and related advertising and other service fees constituted about of the company s total revenues during this period 
because of this concentration  the company s revenues would be significantly affected if california and to a lesser extent arizona eliminated the legal requirement to publish public notices in adjudicated newspapers of general circulation  as has been proposed from time to time 
furthermore  a california appeals court recently ruled that the company s newspaper in one california county could no longer prove it met adjudication requirements prior to  and the publication has now been discontinued 
if more of the company s newspapers were to have their adjudications revoked  those newspapers would no longer be eligible to publish public notice advertising  and it could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
advertising service fees and other are traditional business segment revenues  which include primarily i agency commissions received from outside newspapers in which the advertising is placed and ii fees generated when filing notices with government agencies 
the daily journals accounted for about of the company s total circulation revenues 
the court rule and judicial profile services generated about of the total circulation revenues  with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance 
sustain s consulting revenues  which are subject to uncertainty because they depend on i the timing of the acceptance of the completed consulting tasks  ii the unpredictable needs of sustain s existing customers  and iii sustain s ability to secure new customers  continued to decline in fiscal in part because many governments have reduced their budgets for services like those provided by sustain 
revenues from sustain s new installation projects will only be recognized  if at all  upon completion and acceptance of sustain s services by the various customers 
the company s expenditures for the development of new sustain software products are significant and will materially impact overall results at least through the foreseeable future 
these costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recovery 
sustain expensed personnel costs of  and  for the development and implementation of its web based case management system during fiscal and  respectively 
if sustain s internal development programs are not successful  they will significantly and adversely impact the company s ability to maximize its existing investment in the sustain software  to service its existing customers and to compete for new opportunities in the case management software business 
however  sustain recently has installed its web based case management system in several courts and government agencies  and additional installations are in progress 
sustain expects to receive license fees on account of these installations  but because license fee revenue is recognized over the term of the license  these fees will not have a material impact on sustain s earnings in the short term 
on a pretax profit of  and  for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively  the company recorded a tax provision of  and  respectively  which was lower in each case than the amount computed using the statutory rate because of i the available dividends received deduction and the domestic production activity deduction  and ii the reversal of an uncertain tax liability as the company reached an agreement with the internal revenue service in march to settle the company s previously claimed research and development credits in its tax returns for the years to as a result  the company s previously recorded provision for this matter of approximately  was reduced by  and the interest expense of  previously recognized for this matter was reduced by  consequently  the company s effective tax rate was about and for fiscal and  respectively 
the company files federal income tax returns in the united states and with various state jurisdictions  and it is no longer subject to examinations for the years before with regard to federal income taxes 
net income per share decreased to from liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company s cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bills and marketable security positions increased by  cash and cash equivalents and us treasury bills were used primarily for the purchase of marketable securities of  and capital assets of  mostly computer software and office equipment 
in february  the company purchased shares of common stock of two fortune companies and certain bonds of a third  and during the second and the third quarters of fiscal  the company bought shares of common stock of two foreign manufacturing companies 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company bought shares of common stock of another fortune company 
during the third and the fourth quarters of fiscal  the company purchased additional shares of common stock of one of the foreign manufacturing companies in which it had previously invested 
the investments in marketable securities  which cost approximately  and had a market value of about  at september   generated approximately  in dividends and interest income  which lowers the effective income tax rate because of the dividends received deduction 
as of september   there were unrealized pretax gains of  as compared to  at september  most of the unrealized gains were in the common stocks 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company borrowed million to purchase all of the outstanding stock of new dawn and pledged its marketable securities to obtain favorable financing 
the cash provided by operating activities of  included a net increase in deferred subscription and other revenues of  proceeds from the sale of subscriptions from newspapers  court rule books and other publications and for software licenses and maintenance and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are rendered 
cash flows from operating activities decreased by  during fiscal as compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the increases in accounts receivable of  and the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and net income of  excluding the after tax impairment losses of  as of september   the company had working capital of  including the liability for deferred subscription and other revenues of  which are scheduled to be earned within one year  and the deferred tax liability of  for the unrealized gains described above 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its cash flows from operating activities and its current working capital and expects that any such cash flows will be invested in its two businesses 
the company also may entertain business acquisition opportunities  as it did in acquiring new dawn 
any excess cash flows will be invested as management and the board of directors deem appropriate at the time 
such investments may include additional securities of the companies in which the company has already invested  securities of other companies  government securities including us treasury notes and bills or other instruments 
the decision as to particular investments will be driven by the company s belief about the risk reward profile of the various investment choices at the time  and it may utilize government securities as a default if attractive opportunities for a better return are not available 
the company s chairman of the board  charles munger  is also the vice chairman of berkshire hathaway inc  which maintains a substantial investment portfolio 
the company s board of directors has utilized his judgment and suggestions  as well as those of jp guerin  the company s vice chairman  when selecting investments  and both of them will continue to play an important role in monitoring existing investments and selecting any future investments 
the company continues to have the ability to borrow against its marketable securities on favorable terms as it did for the new dawn acquisition 
as noted above  however  the investments are concentrated in just six companies 
accordingly  a significant decline in the market value of one or more of the company s investments may not be offset by the hypothetically better performance of other investments  and that could result in a large decrease in the company s shareholders equity and  under certain circumstances  in the recognition of impairment losses in the company s income statement such as the other than temporary impairment losses of  recognized in the third quarter of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
management believes that revenue recognition  accounting for capitalized software costs  fair value measurement and disclosures  and income taxes are critical accounting policies 
the company recognizes revenues from both the lease and sale of software products 
revenues from leases of software products are recognized over the life of the lease while revenues from software product sales are recognized normally upon delivery  installation or acceptance pursuant to a signed agreement 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts generally call for the company to provide software updates and upgrades to customers and are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
consulting and other services are recognized as performed or upon acceptance by the customers 
proceeds from the sale of subscriptions for newspapers  court rule books and other publications and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are provided  generally over the subscription or lease term 
advertising revenues are recognized when advertisements are published and are net of commissions 
accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  provides that costs related to the research and development of a new software product are to be expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product is established 
accordingly  costs related to the development of new sustain software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recoverability 
in general  technological feasibility is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills  hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed program design has been i completed  ii traced to the product specifications and iii reviewed for high risk development issues 
asc  fair value measurement and disclosures  requires the company to i disclose the amounts of transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and ii present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level measurements 
this guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the company to determine each class of the investments based on risk and to disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both level and level measurements 
asc  income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
this accounting guidance also prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statements recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations

the above discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report
