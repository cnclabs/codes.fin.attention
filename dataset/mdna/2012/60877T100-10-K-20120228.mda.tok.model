item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a biotechnology company specializing in the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of complex molecules  including polysaccharides  polypeptides  and proteins 
our initial technology was built on the ability to characterize complex polysaccharides 
over the last decade  we have expanded our expertise into technologies that enable us to develop a diversified product portfolio of complex generic  follow on biologic  and novel therapeutics 
our business strategy has been to develop both generic and novel therapeutics  and we are working with collaborative partners to develop and commercialize our complex generics and follow on biologics 
this strategy was validated by the marketing approval and commercial launch of enoxaparin sodium injection  a generic version of lovenox in july since its launch through december   we have recorded enoxaparin product revenues totaling million  driven primarily by its initial status as a sole generic 
we believe that our scientific capabilities  engineering approaches  intellectual property and regulatory strategies  and unique business model positions us to develop and commercialize competitively differentiated products in our target areas of complex generics  follow on biologics and novel therapeutics 
our complex generic programs target marketed products that were originally approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  as new drug applications  or ndas 
therefore  we were able to access the existing generic regulatory pathway and submit abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for these products 
our first commercial product  enoxaparin sodium injection  which we developed and commercialized in collaboration with sandoz  an affiliate of novartis ag  received fda marketing approval in july as a generic version of lovenox 
lovenox is a complex mixture of polysaccharide chains derived from naturally sourced heparin which is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
the enoxaparin anda submitted by our collaborative partner sandoz was the first anda for a generic lovenox to be approved by fda  validating our novel approaches to the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of complex molecules such as lovenox 
following its approval of the enoxaparin anda  fda issued a document that detailed the five scientific criteria it applied to determine that the anda met the statutory requirements for approval of an interchangeable generic drug 
from july through early october  the enoxaparin marketed by sandoz was the sole generic version of lovenox  and consequently  under the terms of our collaborative agreement with sandoz  we earned a substantial profit share on sandoz net sales of enoxaparin 
in developing our enoxaparin product  we filed for patent protection for certain of our enoxaparin related technology and we have sought  and continue to seek to enforce our issued patents 
our second complex generic product candidate  m  is designed to be a generic version of copaxone glatiramer acetate injection  a drug that is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  or rrms 
copaxone consists of a synthetic mixture of polypeptide chains 
with m  we extended our core polysaccharide characterization and process engineering capabilities to develop capabilities for the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of this complex polypeptide mixture 
we are also collaborating with sandoz to develop and commercialize m  and the sandoz anda for m is currently under fda review 
in our development of m we filed for patent protection for 
table of contents certain of our m related technology  and if necessary  we may seek to enforce issued patents relating to our m product 
our follow on biologics fobs program is targeted toward developing biosimilar and interchangeable versions of marketed biologic therapeutics 
in march  an abbreviated regulatory process was codified in section k of the patient protection and affordable care act of this new pathway opens the market for biosimilar and interchangeable versions of a broad array of biologic therapeutics  including antibodies  cytokines  fusion proteins  hormones and blood factors 
forecasters predict a rapidly growing multi billion dollar global market for these products 
most of these biologic therapeutics are complex mixtures  and for several years we have been investing in novel approaches to the structural characterization  process engineering and analysis of biologic systems 
in february  fda released three documents containing their preliminary guidelines for applications under the section k pathway 
these guidelines confirmed that fda will use a totality of the evidence approach that puts a substantial emphasis on extensive structural and functional characterization in evaluating biosimilar products for approval 
we believe the fda guidances provide a framework for our follow on biologics strategy 
our goal is to engineer biologic therapeutics that will show minimal structural or functional differences from the reference brand product  thereby justifying a more selective and targeted approach to non clinical and or human clinical testing to support demonstration of biosimilarity and interchangeability 
our novel therapeutics program leverages the capabilities and expertise built during the development of our complex generics and fob program to address unmet clinical needs 
our most advanced efforts have been in the area of polysaccharide mixtures 
m  our novel polysaccharide based drug candidate  is in development as a potential anti cancer agent that targets over five different key biological mechanisms involved in cancer progression and metastasis 
our other polysaccharide based drug candidate  adomiparin  has been engineered to possess what we believe will be an improved therapeutic profile compared with other currently marketed anticoagulants to support the treatment of acs 
we will not move forward with further clinical trials of adomiparin unless we have a partner for the program 
we are also seeking to discover and develop additional novel drugs based either on the polysaccharide based platform or on a biologics  or proteins and monoclonal antibody  platform 
we have built significant capabilities in biological characterization and engineering of proteins through our fob platform that allow us to create unique and novel formulations of protein and antibody drug compositions for specific disease indications 
to add to these capabilities  in december  we acquired selected assets of virdante pharmaceuticals  inc relating to sialic switch technology 
sialic acid is a type of sugar modification on selected proteins that is understood to regulate specific biological functions of these proteins 
these assets add to our core ability to modify and engineer protein backbones to precisely regulate biological networks and develop novel biologic product candidates 
in november  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement  or the sandoz collaboration  with sandoz nv and sandoz inc to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize enoxaparin sodium injection 
sandoz nv later assigned its rights in the sandoz collaboration to sandoz ag 
we refer to sandoz ag and sandoz inc together as sandoz 
in and  we entered into a series of agreements  including a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement  each with novartis pharma ag  and a collaboration and license agreement  or the definitive agreement  with sandoz ag  an affiliate of novartis pharma ag 
together  this series of agreements is referred to as the sandoz collaboration 
under the definitive agreement  we and sandoz ag jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m in connection with the sandoz collaboration  we sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag at a per share price of the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was on the date of purchase for an aggregate purchase price of million  resulting in an equity premium of million 

table of contents prior to the launch of enoxaparin sodium injection  our revenue had been derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and primarily consisted of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for certain programs 
in july  sandoz began the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
the profit share or royalties sandoz is obligated to pay us under the sandoz collaboration differ depending on whether i there are no third party competitors marketing an interchangeable generic version of lovenox  or lovenox equivalent product as defined in the sandoz collaboration  ii a lovenox equivalent product is being marketed by sanofi aventis  which distributes the brand name lovenox  or licensed by sanofi aventis to another company to be sold as a generic drug  both known as authorized generics  or iii there is one or more third party competitors which is not sanofi aventis marketing a lovenox equivalent product 
until october  no third party competitors were marketing a lovenox equivalent product  therefore  sandoz paid us of the contractual profits from the sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
in october  sandoz confirmed that an authorized generic lovenox equivalent product was being marketed  which meant that sandoz was obligated to pay us a royalty on its net sales of enoxaparin sodium until the contractual profits from those net sales in a product year july june reached a certain threshold  which was achieved in december  and then a profit share  which occurred in late december additionally  in october  fda approved the anda for the enoxaparin product of watson pharmaceuticals  inc  or waston  and amphastar pharmaceuticals  inc or amphastar 
in january  following the court of appeals for the federal circuit granting a stay of the preliminary injunction previously issued against them by the us district court  watson announced that they and amphastar intended to launch their enoxaparin product 
consequently  in each product year  for net sales up to a pre defined sales threshold  sandoz is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales  which is payable at a rate  and for net sales above the sales threshold  increases to 
certain development and legal expenses may reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz 
any product liability costs and certain other expenses arising from patent litigation may also reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz  but only up to of these amounts due to us from sandoz each quarter 
our contractual share of these development and legal expenses is subject to an annual adjustment in each of the next four years  but the amount of any future payment due to the annual adjustment is not expected to be material 
in december  we entered into a global collaboration with baxter international  inc  baxter healthcare corporation and baxter healthcare sa  collectively baxter  to develop and commercialize up to six fobs  which became effective in february baxter is an established healthcare company with global product development  manufacturing and commercial capabilities 
to accelerate efforts in the fob space and address this growing global market  we expect to significantly increase the headcount and related operating expenses dedicated to our fob program in and we expect that the increase in operating expenses will be offset in future years by revenues from option fees and milestone payments under the baxter collaborative agreement  subject to achievement of technical criteria 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
in the second half of  we began to derive revenue from our profit share on the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
due to the launch of a competitor s enoxaparin sodium injection product in january  our product revenue will decrease 
depending on the future outcome of enoxaparin litigation  we may incur annual operating losses over the next several years as we expand our drug commercialization  development and discovery efforts 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or 
table of contents assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenue to maintain profitability 
financial operations overview years ended december   and collaboration revenue collaboration revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for collaboration revenue is summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  collaboration revenues product revenue profit share royalty revenue commercial milestone revenue total product revenue research and development revenue regulatory milestone revenue research and development revenue total research and development revenue total collaboration revenue profit share royalty revenue includes revenue earned from sandoz on sales of enoxaparin sodium injection following its commercial launch in july the profit share or royalties sandoz is obligated to pay us under the sandoz collaboration differ depending on whether i there are no third party competitors marketing an interchangeable generic version of lovenox  or lovenox equivalent product as defined in the sandoz collaboration  ii a lovenox equivalent product is being marketed by sanofi aventis  which distributes the brand name lovenox  or licensed by sanofi aventis to another company to be sold as a generic drug  both known as authorized generics  or iii there is one or more third party competitors which is not sanofi aventis marketing a lovenox equivalent product

in january  following the court of appeals for the federal circuit granting a stay of the preliminary injunction previously issued against them by the us district court  watson announced that they and amphastar intended to launch their enoxaparin product 
consequently  in each product year  for net sales up to a pre defined sales threshold  sandoz is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales  which is payable at a rate  and for net sales above the sales threshold  increases to 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million due to the achievement of a commercial milestone under the sandoz collaboration as a result of enoxaparin sodium injection reaching the one year anniversary from launch as the sole generic on the market 

table of contents research and development revenue for the periods shown consists of amounts earned by us under the sandoz collaboration for reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs  and amounts earned by us under the sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million due to the achievement of a regulatory milestone under the sandoz collaboration related to fda s approval of the enoxaparin sodium injection anda 
there are a number of factors that make it difficult for us to predict the magnitude of future enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue  including the impact of generic competition on the sandoz market share  the pricing of products that compete with enoxaparin sodium injection and other actions taken by our competitors  the inventory levels of enoxaparin sodium injection maintained by wholesalers  distributors and other customers  the frequency of re orders by existing customers and the change in estimates for product reserves 
accordingly  our enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue in previous quarters will not be indicative of future enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue 
research and development expense research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  contract research and manufacturing costs  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million  or  from the period to the period resulted from a million in process research and development charge related to our purchase of assets from virdante and increases of million in facility related expenses  principally due to the lease extension for our headquarters for an additional term of months  million in personnel and related costs associated with our headcount growth to support our programs  million in process development and third party research costs in support of our novel drug discovery program  million in laboratory expenses  million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the amortization related to a milestone payment made during made with respect to our asset purchase from parivid  million in consulting fees related to our m and novel drug discovery programs  and million in share based compensation expense principally associated with our employee wide grant of performance based restricted stock 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in preclinical costs related to our m program 
the decrease of million  or  from to resulted from decreases of million in process development  manufacturing and third party research costs in support of our development programs  principally our m program  million in consultant costs and million in clinical development costs both of which were associated with the completion in july of the phase a clinical trial for our adomiparin program  million in laboratory expenses related to our enoxaparin sodium injection program  million in depreciation expense and facility related expense and million in share based compensation expense 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in personnel and related costs primarily due to performance payments made in connection with the approval and launch of enoxaparin sodium injection in july and a million credit to research and development expense as a result of a revision to an accrued milestone liability in 
table of contents the lengthy process of securing fda approval for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal commercial and development programs for the years ended december   and  and it shows the total external costs including amortization incurred by us for each of our major commercial and development projects 
the table excludes costs incurred by our collaborative partner on such major commercial and development projects 
we do not maintain or evaluate  and therefore do not allocate  internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
consequently  we do not analyze internal research and development costs by project in managing our research and development activities 
research and development expense in thousands project inception to december  commercial and development programs status enoxaparin sodium injection anda approved july m anda filed adomiparin phase a other development programs discovery programs research and development internal costs total research and development expense the increase of million in external expenditures for enoxaparin sodium injection from the period to the period was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to a milestone payment with respect to our asset purchase from parivid made in offset by a shift to commercial activity being contracted directly with sandoz 
the decrease of million in m external expenditures from the period to the period was primarily due to timing of process development activities  manufacturing and third party research costs 
the decrease of million in adomiparin external expenditures from the period to the period was due to reduction in spend on this program in other development program spend remained consistent from the period to the period due to process development on our m program 
the increase of million in the discovery programs was primarily due to a million in process research and development expense related to our purchase of assets from virdante and an increase in external services and research collaborations associated with our discovery programs 
the research and development internal costs consist of compensation and other expense for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
the increase of million from the period to the period  was due to additional research and development headcount and related costs in support of our development programs 
the decrease of million in external expenditures for enoxaparin sodium injection from the period to the period was primarily due to decreased manufacturing activity and a shift to commercial activity being contracted directly with sandoz 
the decrease of million in m 
table of contents external expenditures from the period to the period was primarily due to the timing of process development activities  manufacturing and third party research costs 
the decrease of million in adomiparin external expenditures from the period to the period was due to the completion of our phase a clinical trial in june the increase of million in the other development programs from the period to the period primarily related to an increase in m manufacturing  preclinical and toxicology work 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include royalty and license fees  facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services and other general expenses 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense increased by million  or  from the period to the period due to increases of million in royalty and license fees payable primarily to massachusetts institute of technology associated with the sales of enoxaparin sodium injection and milestones earned by us related to enoxaparin sodium injection  million in professional fees principally due to increased legal fees relating to enoxaparin litigation  million in personnel and related costs associated with our headcount growth  million in facility related expenses principally due to the lease extension for our headquarters for an additional term of months  and million in consulting activities 
general and administrative expense increased by million  or  from the period to the period due to increases of million in royalty and license fees payable to massachusetts institute of technology associated with the launch and sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  million in professional and other fees primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting activities  million in personnel and related costs primarily due to performance payments made in connection with the approval and launch of enoxaparin sodium injection in july  and a million increase in share based compensation expense 
we expect our general and administrative expenses  including internal and external legal and business development costs that support our various product development efforts  to vary from period to period in relation to our commercial and development activities 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from the period to the period was primarily due to higher average investment balances because we earned significant product revenue from sandoz during the decrease of million from the period to the period was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from the period to the period and the decrease of million from the period to the period were primarily due to the completion of repayment schedules on our equipment line of credit during and 
table of contents other income expense other income of million for the year ended december  was due to the receipt of a tax grant related to the approval of our application for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program during liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  including profit share royalty payments related to sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  and borrowings from our lines of credit and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received million through private and public issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares to novartis pharma ag in connection with our sandoz collaboration 
as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations and million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility and additional funds from interest income 
the fact that we and sandoz are no longer the sole generic competitor to lovenox  and we currently receive and will continue to receive a royalty based on net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection has had and will have a negative impact on our near term cash generation trend 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in accounts receivable 
in addition  we also held million in restricted cash which serves as collateral for a security bond posted in the litigation against watson pharmaceuticals inc  amphastar pharmaceuticals inc 
and international medical systems  ltd 
a wholly owned subsidiary of amphastar 
our funds at december  were primarily invested in senior debt of government sponsored enterprises  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and united states money market funds  directly or through managed funds  with remaining maturities of months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of our evaluation of conditions in the financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents and marketable securities were subject to significant risk at december  during the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of million

our ability to generate taxable income in depends on the outcome of the enoxaparin litigation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue profit share and or royalty revenue is reported as product revenue and is recognized based upon net sales or profit share of licensed products in licensed territories in the period the sales occur as provided by the collaboration agreement 
these amounts are determined based on amounts provided by the collaboration partner and involve the use of estimates and judgments  such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts  chargebacks  governmental and other rebates  distributor  wholesaler and group purchasing organizations  or gpo  fees  and product returns  which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future 
research and development revenue to date  we have received revenue from collaboration agreements with one collaborative partner 
under the terms of collaboration agreements entered into by us  we have received and may continue to receive non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved and or profit sharing or royalties on product sales 
agreements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is then allocated among the separate units based on either their respective fair values or the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
in january  we adopted financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements topic  or asu  on a prospective basis for all multiple element arrangements entered into on or after january  and for any multiple element arrangements that were entered into prior to january  but materially modified on or after january  pursuant to asu  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
the arrangement s consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the following hierarchy of values i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  and iii best estimate of the selling price  or besp 
the besp reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
we expect  in general  to use besp for allocating consideration to each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january  and not materially modified thereafter  we continue to apply its prior accounting policy with respect to such arrangements 
under this policy  in general  revenue from non refundable  upfront fees related to intellectual property rights licenses where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the estimated period of ongoing involvement  which is typically the development term  because there was no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any undelivered item to allow the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting 
this requirement with respect to the fair value of undelivered items was modified in the newly issued accounting standard 
research and development funding is recognized as earned over the period of effort 
in general  the consideration with respect to the other deliverables is recognized when the goods or services are delivered 

table of contents we have research  collaboration and license agreements related to the development and commercialization of product candidates pursuant to which we could receive consideration in the form of milestone payments in future periods 
in january  we adopted asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  or asu  on a prospective basis for all sales based  commercial and research and development milestones achieved 
pursuant to asu  at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate each milestone to determine whether a the milestone can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either i our performance or ii on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  b there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and c the achievement of the event would result in additional payments being due to us 
additionally  we evaluate whether each milestone is considered substantive 
we designate a milestone as substantive only if it meets all of the following three criteria the consideration is commensurate with either a our performance to achieve the milestone or b the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
we have concluded that all of the development and regulatory milestones pursuant to our existing research and development arrangements are substantive 
revenues from development and regulatory milestones  if they are nonrefundable and deemed substantive  are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones as research and development revenue 
milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and are evaluated as such in accordance with our accounting policy for multiple element arrangements 
sales based and commercial milestones are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
fair value measurements we have certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as level or within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements 
the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value 
the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows level fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves  and level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
our financial assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at the end of each reporting period  typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data 
the pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models  including both income and market based approaches  and observable market inputs to determine value 
these observable market inputs include reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  
table of contents offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by its third party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and matrices  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming that the relevant markets are active 
we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by its pricing services as of december  and december  the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash  accounts receivable  unbilled revenue  other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
the carrying amounts of the capital lease obligations approximate their fair values due to their variable interest rates 
marketable securities available for sale debt securities are recorded at fair market value 
purchased premiums or discounts on debt securities are amortized to interest income through the stated maturities of the debt securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value is considered other than temporary  based on available evidence  the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive income loss to the statements of operations 
there were no charges taken for other than temporary declines in fair value of marketable securities in  or realized gains and losses are reported in interest income on a specific identification basis 
there were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities during the years ended december   or fair value of other financial instruments the carrying amounts of our financial instruments that are not stated at fair value  which include accounts receivable  unbilled collaboration revenue and other accrued expenses  approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
the carrying amount of our line of credit and capital lease obligations approximate their fair values due to their variable interest rates 
intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets that we value and record 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
share based compensation expense we recognize the fair value of share based compensation in our statement of operations 
share based compensation expense primarily relates to stock options  restricted stock and stock issued under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
we recognize share based compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost  based on the market value on the date of the grant  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we issue new shares to 
table of contents satisfy stock option exercises  the issuance of restricted stock and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
we believe a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause share based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical employee exercise and post vest termination behavior and expected term data from our peer group to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
we update these assumptions as needed to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative adjustment on a quarterly basis 
the value of our restricted stock awards is recognized as compensation cost in our consolidated statements of operations over each award s explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award s implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award s vesting conditions will be achieved 
we reevaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
income taxes we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be recovered 
we apply judgment in the determination of the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize any material interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and multiple state jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to any tax assessment from an income tax examination for years before  except to the extent that in the future we utilize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that originated before currently we are not under examination by the internal revenue service or other jurisdictions for any tax years 
related party transactions in april  we entered into an asset purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement  with parivid  llc  or parivid  a provider of data integration and analysis services to us  and s 
raguram  the principal owner and chief technology officer of parivid 
parivid was considered to be a related party as a co founder and then member of our board of directors is the brother of s 
raguram 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired patent rights  software  know how and other intangible assets  and assumed certain specified liabilities of parivid related to the acquired assets in exchange for million in cash paid at closing and up to million in contingent milestone payments in a 
table of contents combination of cash and or stock in the manner and on the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement 
the contingent milestone payments are structured to include i potential payments of no more than million in cash if certain milestones are achieved within two years from the date of the purchase agreement  or the initial milestones  and ii the issuance of up to million of our common stock to parivid if certain other milestones are achieved within fifteen years of the date of the purchase agreement 
in  we recorded a total purchase price of million that includes the million cash paid at the closing and million in initial milestone payments  which were probable and accrued at the time 
in august  we entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement where we agreed to extend the time period for completion of the initial milestones to june   specified those initial milestones that had been achieved as of june  and  as consideration for the completion and satisfaction of the initial milestones that were achieved  agreed to pay parivid million cash and to issue  shares of our common stock  at a value of per share 
in addition  in september  we made a cash payment of million to parivid  recorded as other expense  representing the difference between the net proceeds from parivid s sale of the shares issued in satisfaction of the initial milestones and the value of such shares as of the date of the amendment 
in july  we entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement where the parties agreed that a milestone payment would be made in cash rather than through the issuance of our common stock 
in august  we paid parivid million in cash  in lieu of stock  pursuant to this amendment as consideration for the completion and satisfaction of a milestone related to the enoxaparin sodium injection developed technology that was achieved in july we capitalized the payment as developed technology  which is included in intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the developed technology is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the enoxaparin sodium injection developed technology of approximately years 
recently issued accounting standards please see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of new accounting standards 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements are contained in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of united states money market  government secured  and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  low prevailing market rates and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
