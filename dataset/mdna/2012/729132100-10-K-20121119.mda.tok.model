net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales increase 
table of contents resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors  except for a decrease in the networking communications sector 
the net sales increase primarily related to the continued ramp of production for a significant industrial commercial sector customer and million of incremental revenue from the previously announced strategic arrangement with kontron the kontron arrangement  as well as program ramps from several other existing customers 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by decreased sales in the networking communications sector due to lower end market demand and the two previously announced customer disengagements due to the acquisition of such customers

our net sales by market sector for fiscal  and were as follows in millions market sector networking communications industrial commercial healthcare life sciences defense security aerospace networking communications 
net sales for the networking communications sector decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in the sector was primarily the result of the impact from the prior year disengagement of two significant customers noted above of approximately million and overall unfavorable end market trends reflecting global economic uncertainty

table of contents the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for fiscal  and were as follows juniper top customers on november   juniper notified us that it will disengage with plexus 
the specific timing of the transition of the juniper business from plexus is not known at this time  although it is currently expected to occur by the end of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the financial  operational and other impacts of the disengagement 
gross profit 
for fiscal  gross profit increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to the net sales increase 
the increase was partially offset by increased fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth  costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in penang  malaysia of approximately million  transition costs due to the kontron arrangement  and an unfavorable change in customer mix 
customer mix negatively impacted gross profit due to a higher portion of sales from new programs  which tend to be inherently less profitable during early production stages than mature programs 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by escalated pricing pressure  particularly in our networking communications sector 
these factors led to the reduction in gross margin from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal for fiscal  gross profit increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to increased net sales in all of our market sectors except networking communications  driven by demand from new and existing customers across the majority of our market sectors  partially offset by unfavorable changes in customer mix  which together accounted for approximately million of the net increase in gross profit 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in fixed manufacturing costs due to increased headcount expenses to support revenue growth of approximately million 
fixed costs also grew as a percentage of sales as a result of expansion in our apac and emea regions as they ramped to capacity  as well as the underutilization of two amer facilities  due to the disengagement of a significant customer and the slower ramp of a significant customer  increased depreciation expense of million due to the expansions mentioned above  and the effect of the non recurrence of a million benefit in the first quarter of fiscal from a litigation settlement 
these factors led to the reduction in gross margin from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal operating income 
for fiscal  operating income increased million compared to fiscal the operating income increase reflected the million increase in gross profit described above  partially offset by a million increase in selling and administrative expenses s a 
the dollar increase in s a is primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expense  million of amortization expense resulting from an intangible asset related to the kontron arrangement  and an increase in other personnel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk 
as a result of the factors discussed above  for fiscal compared to fiscal  operating margin remained at percent 
for fiscal  operating income increased million compared to fiscal the operating income increase reflected the million increase in gross profit described above  partially offset by a million increase in s a 
the increase in s a expenses was due to increased employee compensation and relocation expense of approximately million as a result of higher headcount to support revenue growth  as well as higher stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of lower variable incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal the above factors led to a reduction of operating margin to percent for fiscal from percent for fiscal other income expense 
other expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in expense was largely due to million of increased interest expense primarily related to the million of borrowings under the note purchase agreement that the company entered into during the third quarter of fiscal  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
other expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this change was driven by the favorable fluctuation in foreign currency transactions of million  partially offset by increased interest expense of million  primarily related to the million of borrowings noted above  which we entered into during the third quarter of fiscal  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in millions income tax expense  as reported effective annual tax rate  as reported income tax expense for fiscal increased to million compared million for fiscal and million for fiscal  as a result of the increase in our effective tax rate 
these rates primarily vary from the us statutory rate of percent as a result of the amount of earnings from different us and foreign jurisdictions  and tax holidays granted to our subsidiaries in china and malaysia  where we derive a significant portion of our earnings 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is significantly higher than the effective rate for fiscal primarily as a result of the additional valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets in the us of million  which is discussed further below 
the fiscal effective tax rate  adjusted for the valuation allowance to  and the effective tax rate for fiscal were higher than the effective tax rate for primarily as a result of increased profitability in the us tax jurisdiction 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate in the future depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings 
during the preparation of the company s fiscal consolidated financial statements  the company performed an analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  consistent with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes 
under these accounting rules  the weight given to positive and negative evidence is proportionate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
accordingly  as of september   the company established an additional valuation allowance of million million provision  offset by million to other comprehensive income against our us deferred tax assets 
this was based on the significant negative evidence of the company s us cumulative loss position and the deterioration of our forecasts late in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  which has impacted forecasted profitability in the near term in the amer region 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately to percent 
the rate is consistent with the fiscal rate before the effects of the valuation allowance are taken into account 
the company has been granted tax holidays for its malaysian and xiamen  china subsidiaries 
these tax holidays expire in and  respectively  and are subject to certain conditions with which the company expects to comply 
the expiration of the tax holiday in china is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate 
however  we cannot provide any assurances as to the effect and will continue to monitor the projected impact 
in fiscal  and  these subsidiaries generated income  which resulted in tax reductions of approximately million per basic share  million per basic share and million per basic share  respectively 
net income 
primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above  net income for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  to million from fiscal excluding the valuation allowance adjustment  net income was million  a decrease of million  or percent from fiscal as a result of higher fixed expenses and increased interest expense  partially offset by the effect of higher net sales 
primarily as a result of lower gross margins and increases to income tax expense  net income for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  to million from fiscal diluted earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above 
excluding the valuation allowance adjustment  diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share excluding the valuation allowance adjustment was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed late in fiscal  partially offset by lower net income 
diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed in fiscal  partially offset by the slight decrease in net income previously noted 
return on invested capital roic 
we use a financial model which is aligned with our business strategy  and includes a roic goal of basis points over our weighted average cost of capital wacc  a gross margin target and a operating margin target 
our primary focus is our roic goal  which is designed to create shareholder value and generate 
table of contents enough cash to self fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of we review our internal calculation of wacc annually  and our estimated wacc was percent for fiscal by exercising discipline to generate roic in excess of our wacc  our goal is to create value for our shareholders 
roic was excluding million net deferred tax asset reduction  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to slightly lower tax effected annualized operating income as a result of a higher effective tax rate 
see the table below for our calculation of roic dollars in millions operating income tax effected average invested capital after tax roic we define roic as tax effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five quarter period for the fiscal year 
invested capital is defined as equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents 
other companies may not define or calculate roic in the same way 
roic is a non gaap financial measure which should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
non gaap financial measures  including roic  are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance 
in particular  we provide roic because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view roic as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long term capital requirements 
we also use a derivative measure of roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation 
for a reconciliation of roic to our financial statements that were prepared using gaap  see exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
reportable segments a further discussion of our fiscal  and financial performance by reportable segment is presented below in millions net sales amer apac emea elimination of inter segment sales operating income loss amer apac emea corporate and other costs americas amer net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased end market demand in the networking communications sector  which included the loss of two significant networking communications customers  one as a result of a previously announced customer disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer 
these decreases were partially offset by the ramp of production for our significant industrial commercial sector customer and the addition of a new customer in this sector as well 
net sales to juniper did not change significantly from fiscal operating income for fiscal increased million from fiscal due to a favorable customer mix  an increase in engineering design and services profitability of approximately 
table of contents million and million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal  which reflected the ramp of production for our newer industrial commercial sector customer 
net sales to juniper also increased as a result of improved end market demand for the mix of juniper products we produce in the region as well as new product launches 
these increases were offset by reduced net sales to two significant networking communications customers  as noted above 
operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal due to fiscal benefiting from a million litigation settlement  as well as unfavorable changes in customer mix in fiscal asia pacific apac net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this growth reflected incremental revenue from the kontron arrangement of approximately million as well as higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors 
these increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the networking communications sector and a decline in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for another customer in this sector as well for an industrial commercial sector customer 
operating income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in penang  malaysia of approximately million  increased expenses related to higher headcount to support capacity investments  transition costs for the kontron arrangement and escalated pricing pressure 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this growth reflected higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors as well as increased demand from a new customer in the industrial commercial sector 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales from the previously announced disengagement of one customer in the networking communications sector as well as a drop in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for an additional networking communications customer 
operating income improved million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the net sales growth  partially offset by unfavorable changes in customer mix and higher fixed expenses 
europe  middle east and africa emea net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase in net sales was driven primarily by the addition of new customers in each of our market sectors  partially offset by decreased net sales to an industrial commercial customer as a result of reduced end market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer 
operating results improved in the current year as compared to the prior year due to increased profitability in romania based on the mix of customers and increased leverage at the facility 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the change in net sales was driven by higher demand from two existing customer programs as well as the ramp of production for two new customers 
operating results were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased operating costs from our romania facility and our new engineering facility in darmstadt  germany 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of september  compared to million as of october  the increase in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash generated from operations  partially offset by cash used for the kontron arrangement  capital expenditures and payments on debt 
as of september   approximately two thirds of our cash balance was held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries 
certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash  however  our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries 
if this cash were remitted to the us  additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the us currently  we believe that cash held in the us  together with cash available under us credit facilities and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the us without tax consequences  will be sufficient to meet our us liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future

the following table shows a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated in days three months ended september  october  october  days in accounts receivable days in inventory days in accounts payable days in cash deposits annualized cash cycle we calculate days in accounts receivable as accounts receivable for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day 
we calculate days in inventory  accounts payable  and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day 
days in accounts receivable for the three months ended september  increased by one day compared to the three months ended october   primarily due to the timing of net sales at the end of the current year period 
days in inventory for the three months ended september  decreased by seven days compared to the three months ended october   due to our efforts to actively manage inventory levels down with the assistance of our customers  while continuing to meet our customers needs for flexibility and agility as well as support revenue growth 
days in accounts payable for the three months ended september  increased by one day compared to the three months ended october   primarily due to the timing of the purchases during the quarter 
days in cash deposits for the three months ended september  were consistent with the three months ended october  at six days 
we calculate cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits

cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for fiscal cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to the expenditure of million of cash related to the kontron arrangement in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal increased slightly from fiscal to million primarily due to capital expenditures for new facilities in penang  malaysia and xiamen  china 
we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal we currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million 
a significant portion of the fiscal capital expenditures is anticipated to be used for the construction of our previously announced manufacturing facilities in neenah  wisconsin and oradea  romania to replace leased buildings in both locations 
we believe the estimated capital expenditures will continue to be funded from operations  and may be supplemented by short term borrowings  if required  although we can provide no assurances

on may   the company entered into a five year  million senior unsecured credit facility that terminates on may  the credit facility 
the credit facility includes a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility potentially may be increased by million the increase option to million generally by mutual agreement of the company  the lenders  the letter of credit issuers and the administrative agent named in the related credit agreement the credit agreement  subject to certain customary conditions 
the credit facility was used to refinance the company s then existing million senior unsecured revolving credit facility no amounts were outstanding as of may  and its million senior unsecured term loan balance of million as of may   both of which were scheduled to mature on april   and for general corporate purposes 
quarterly principal repayments of the credit facility term loan of million per quarter began june  and end on march  the final million payment is due on may  the financial covenants as defined under the credit facility require that the company maintain  as of each fiscal quarter end  a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
as of september   the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility  at the company s option  bear interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based upon the company s leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
rates would increase upon negative changes in specified company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio  to no less than libor plus or the base rate plus 
we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused revolver credit commitment based on our leverage ratio  the fee was as of september  during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a note purchase agreement the note purchase agreement for million in principal amount of senior notes  due june  the notes 
we issued million in principal amount of the notes on april   and the remaining million on june  the note purchase agreement contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test  all as defined in the agreements

on october   the company received approval from the board of directors for a new stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock 
it is anticipated that this program will be funded with existing cash and is expected to be executed quarterly  on a relatively consistent basis  during fiscal based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  the credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
further  million of committed credit is currently available under the credit facility  with another million potentially available pursuant to the increase option 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  particularly due to the current uncertainty of the credit and financial markets  we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms

our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation the financial accounting standard board fasb requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
we used the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that we adopted the fasb regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on management s assumptions  including future revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts with durations of twelve months or less  are typically recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the proportional performance model 
the completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist 
any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
accordingly  the company does not currently provide for additional us and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of a reduction in forecasted near term profitability in the amer region  we established a valuation allowance resulting in an additional tax provision of approximately million  with an offset to other comprehensive income of million  for a net additional allowance amount of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
we enter into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated transactions in our apac reportable segment  as described in note  derivatives and fair value measurements  to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for fiscal   and were as follows net sales total costs the company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods presented above 
based on the company s overall currency exposure  as of september   a percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments as well as debt  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we have entered into interest rate swaps for million in term loans  as described in note  derivatives and fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
as is common with these types of agreements  our interest rate swaps are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder 

table of contents the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk as of september   is associated with our credit facility under which we borrowed million 
through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on interest expense
