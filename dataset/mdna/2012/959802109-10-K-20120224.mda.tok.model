significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations include transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses 
transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by  among other things  the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  a reduction in the size of the migrant population  interruptions in migration 
table of contents patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns or political events  could adversely affect our transaction volume 
for discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods  refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below 
revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers  the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
we intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors 
decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins in the near term  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
a majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions  which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue 
the impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program

transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the united states dollar in the region compared to most other foreign currencies  which negatively impacted revenue  and many of the same factors described above 
the americas region of our consumer to consumer segment  which represented of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   experienced revenue increases due to strong transaction growth  although the increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of the global business payments segment  which is discussed in greater detail in segment discussion  also experienced revenue growth during the year ended december  compared to the prior year due to our acquisition of custom house  which was partially offset by declines in our united states cash based bill payments businesses

cost of services cost of services increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to agent commissions  which increase in relation to revenue increases  the weakening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies  which resulted in a negative impact on the translation of our expenses  and incremental operating costs associated with tgbp  partially offset by commission savings resulting from the acquisitions of finint and costa  and the lowering of certain other agent commission rates 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to commission savings resulting from the acquisitions of finint and costa  offset by negative currency impacts 
cost of services increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to incremental costs  including those related to custom house  our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives  including our web and account based money transfer services  agent commissions  which primarily increase in relation to revenue increases  and restructuring and related expenses of million  offset by operating efficiencies  primarily decreased bad debt expense

sg a decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual that was recorded in  as described below  lower marketing related expenditures and operating efficiencies  offset by incremental costs associated with custom house and our retail expansion in europe pursuant to the payment services directive  restructuring and related expenses of million and higher employee compensation costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded an accrual of million for an agreement and settlement with the state of arizona and other states 
on february   we signed this agreement and settlement  which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the state of arizona and required us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the united states and mexico border  in which california  texas and new mexico are participating with arizona 
the accrual included amounts for reimbursement to the state of arizona for its costs associated with this matter 
in addition  as part of the agreement and settlement  we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the united states and mexico border and a monitor has been engaged for those programs 
the costs of the investments in our programs and for the monitor are expected to reach up to million over the period from signing to during the years ended december   and  marketing related expenditures  principally classified within sg a  were approximately   and  respectively  of revenue 
marketing related expenditures include advertising  events  loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities

these amounts were partially offset by increased interest expense in due to our debt issuances 
total other expense  net increased during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from our million note issuance and financing costs incurred in connection with our note exchange  and a decrease in interest income due to lower short term interest rates and the repayment of a note receivable due from an agent 
these amounts were partially offset by the recovery of million of the million reserve recorded in the prior year against our receivable from the reserve international liquidity fund due to the final settlement 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rates on pre tax income were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is primarily due to an agreement with the irs resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in  as described below  slightly offset by higher taxes associated with the finint and costa remeasurement gains 
the tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted by a cumulative tax planning benefit from certain foreign acquisitions and the settlement with the irs of certain issues relating to the tax years 
we continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived  and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
in december  we reached an agreement with the irs resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in as a result of the irs agreement  we expect to make cash payments in of approximately million  which are in addition to the million tax deposit we made with the irs in this deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to our related tax liabilities  to the extent of the deposit 
the million refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction to income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  also as a result of the irs agreement  we recognized a tax benefit of million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter 
we also expect the settlement with the irs to result in a lower effective tax rate in future years 
we have established contingency reserves for a variety of material  known tax exposures 
as of december   the total amount of tax contingency reserves was million  including accrued interest and penalties  net of related benefits 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows

americas revenue increased due to transaction growth of for the year ended december  compared to the same period in our domestic business experienced revenue growth of for the year ended december  due to transaction growth of 
transaction growth in our domestic business was higher than revenue growth due to transaction growth being greater in lower principal bands  which have lower revenue per transaction 
our united states outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended december  mexico revenue increased on flat transactions for the year ended december  our mexico business is being affected by on going changes to our compliance procedures related to the agreement and settlement with the state of arizona and other states 
these changes are expected to cause our mexico business to decline in revenue in our asia pacific apac region increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to transaction growth of and the weakening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies  which positively impacted revenue 
china s revenue increased for year ended december  on transaction growth of for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  grew compared to the same period in  driven primarily by increased amounts of cross border principal sent 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a benefit to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  of million over the same period in  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the largest benefit was related to the emeasa region 
we have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account a variety of factors 
fee and foreign exchange reductions generally reduce revenues in the near term  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
in certain corridors  we may also implement fee or foreign exchange spread increases 
in  we adjusted our reporting of the net impact of price reductions 
we now calculate the impact of price reductions against prior year transaction volumes  rather than current year transaction volumes 
we believe utilizing prior year transaction volumes more appropriately differentiates between the impacts of price reductions versus other items impacting revenue 
under the new methodology  the fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately of total western union revenue for the full year compared to approximately for the full year  as fee reductions were slightly lower and there is some offset by modest increases in foreign currency spreads in some corridors 
under the previous methodology  we reported that the impact of price reductions in was 

table of contents the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations  new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  is often experienced as locations mature 
we believe that new agent locations will help our growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
we generally refer to locations with more than of transactions being initiated versus paid as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations 
send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue 
they contribute more transactions per location than receive locations 
however  a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers 
the number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  migration patterns  the location s class of trade  hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering our services  regulatory limitations and competition 
each of the more than  agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services  however  not every location completes a transaction in a given period 
for example  as of december   more than of agent locations in the united states  canada and western europe representing at least one of our three money transfer brands western union  orlandi valuta sm and vigo experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
in the developing regions of asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations  approximately of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous months 
we periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions 
compared to for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  consumer to consumer money transfer revenue grew primarily due to transaction growth of 
transaction growth was offset by price decreases  primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of  geographic and product mix  including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity  and the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies  which negatively impacted revenue by approximately 
our international consumer to consumer business experienced revenue growth of on transaction growth of for the year ended december  our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the united states and canada and transactions to and from mexico 
our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states also experienced revenue growth on transaction increases for the year ended december  revenue in our emeasa region remained flat during the year ended december  compared to the prior year despite transaction growth of 
transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the united states dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors described above

china s revenue increased on transaction growth of for the year ended december  foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  grew compared to the prior year  driven primarily by revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and currencies other than the united states dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended december  of million over the same period in the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates 
the largest impact was related to the emeasa region 
operating income compared to consumer to consumer operating income increased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to revenue growth

table of contents revenues compared to during the year ended december   global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of tgbp  which contributed million of revenue  primarily included in foreign exchange revenues  and revenue growth in international bill payments  business solutions  and united states electronic bill payments  partially offset by a decline in united states cash based bill payments 
transaction growth during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to growth in our international bill payments and united states electronic bill payments businesses 
compared to during the year ended december   global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of custom house  which contributed million of revenue in versus million in  primarily included in foreign exchange revenues  and growth in the pago f cil business 
these increases were offset by revenue declines in our united states cash based bill payments businesses as many united states consumers who would use our services continued to have difficulty paying their bills and continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form  resulting in us handling fewer bill payments 
the ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the united states and competitive pressures  which resulted in lower cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products  also contributed to the revenue declines 
the transaction declines during the year ended december  compared to the same period in were due to declines in our united states bill payments businesses 
operating income compared to for the year ended december   operating income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue increases  a decrease in integration expenses related to the acquisition of custom house  decreased debit card bank fees due to the recent durbin legislation  and restructuring savings  partially offset by declines in our united states cash based bill payments business  which has a higher margin than other payment services in the segment  and integration and amortization expenses related to the acquisition of tgbp 
the changes in operating income margins in the segment are due to the same factors mentioned above 
compared to for the year ended december   operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines related to the united states cash based bill payments business  and investing and operating costs  including amortization expense  associated with the acquisition of custom house 
the decline in operating income margin in the segment is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the acquisition of custom house and declines in our united states cash based bill payments business

compared to revenue  generated primarily from our money order services business  declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of from ips on outstanding money order balances as we did for the first three quarters of we now derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets  which are primarily held in united states tax exempt state and municipal debt securities 
these securities generally have a lower rate of return than we were receiving under our previous agreement with ips 
operating loss income compared to during the year ended december   the increase in operating loss was primarily due to deal costs associated with the tgbp acquisition 
compared to during the year ended december   the decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our money order services business  as described above  and an increase in promotional marketing activities related to our prepaid business in the united states 
in  we also incurred additional costs associated with evaluating and closing acquisitions compared to further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue  operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents changes in reportable segments in connection with the acquisition of tgbp  recent management changes  and other key strategic initiatives  we will implement a new segment structure to assess performance and allocate resources  beginning in the first quarter of the changes in our segment structure primarily relate to the separation of the global business payments segment into two new reportable segments  consumer to business and business solutions 
a summary of how the segments will be structured follows segment description consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers  primarily through a global network of third party agents 
consumer to business processing of payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations  including utilities  auto finance companies  mortgage servicers  financial service providers  government agencies and other businesses 
business solutions business to business payment solutions  primarily for cross border  cross currency transactions  including services provided under our existing western union business solutions business and tgbp  which was acquired in november other businesses that have not been classified into one of our other segments 
these businesses primarily include our money order and prepaid services businesses 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities  primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital 
our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings  timing of income tax payments  including our tax deposit described further in cash flows from operating activities  and collections on receivables  among other items 
the majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters 
our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors  some of which are out of our control  including changes in economic conditions  especially those impacting the migrant population and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits  including the resolution of outstanding tax matters 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries  some of which are regulated entities 
these subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions  totaling approximately million as of december   include assets outside of the united states subject to restrictions from being transferred outside of the countries where they are located 
we are also required to maintain cash and investment balances in our regulated subsidiaries related to certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations 
significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs  including approximately million of tax payments we expect to make in as a result of the irs agreement  dividends and share repurchases  through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our billion revolving credit facility revolving credit facility and had million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding  which left  million remaining that was available to borrow on the revolving credit facility 

table of contents cash and investment securities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which million was held by our foreign entities 
our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause united states and foreign cash balances to fluctuate 
repatriating foreign funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally 
in many cases  we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions 
these funds  referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are not used to support our operations 
however  we earn income from investing these funds 
we maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments  classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets  to fund settlement obligations 
investment securities  classified within settlement assets  were billion as of december  substantially all of these investments are highly rated state and municipal debt securities 
most state regulators in the united states require us to maintain specific highly rated  investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations 
investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio 
as of december   the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration 
as of december   all investments with a single issuer and each individual security was less than of our investment securities portfolio 
cash flows from operating activities during the years ended december   and  cash provided by operating activities was  million  million and  million  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we made a million tax deposit relating to united states federal tax liabilities  including those arising from our international restructuring  which have been previously accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such tax liabilities  to the extent of the deposit 

table of contents financing resources as of december   we had the following outstanding borrowings in millions due in less than one year commercial paper due in greater than one year a floating rate notes due b notes effective rate of due notes due c notes effective rate of due d notes due c notes due c notes due c other borrowings total borrowings at par value fair value hedge accounting adjustments  net a unamortized discount  net total borrowings at carrying value e a we utilize interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of our notes from fixed rate payments to short term libor based variable rate payments in order to manage our overall exposure to interest rates 
the changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the related note 
these hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in interest expense over the life of the related notes and cause the effective rate of interest to differ from the notes stated rate 
b on march   we issued million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due march  notes

our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to days from date of issuance 

table of contents interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance 
our commercial paper borrowings as of december  had a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately and a weighted average term of days 
during the year ended december   the average commercial paper balance outstanding was million and the maximum balance outstanding was million 
proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general liquidity 
we had million of commercial paper outstanding as of december  revolving credit facility on september   we entered into a credit agreement which expires january providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of billion  including a million letter of credit sub facility and a million swing line sub facility 
the revolving credit facility replaced our billion revolving credit facility that was set to expire in september interest due under the revolving credit facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing 
generally  interest is calculated using a selected libor rate plus an interest rate margin of basis points 
a facility fee of basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility  regardless of usage 
both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings 
the purpose of our revolving credit facility  which is diversified through a group of participating institutions  is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program  which we believe enhances our short term credit rating 
the largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of billion is approximately 
as of and during the year ended december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our billion revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding  which left  million remaining that was available to borrow on the revolving credit facility 
if the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased  or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated  the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted

credit ratings and debt covenants the credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business  managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms 
factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings  cash flow generation  leverage  available liquidity and the overall business 
our revolving credit facility contains an interest rate margin and facility fee which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions in our notes  notes  notes and notes and certain of our derivative contracts which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade 
we do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings

our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
a downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following our access to the commercial paper market may be limited  and if we were downgraded below investment grade  our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated  
table of contents we may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease  regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us  including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends  and our business relationships may be adversely impacted 
consistent with the prior facility  the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company  grant certain types of security interests  incur certain types of liens  impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness  subject to certain exceptions 
our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the notes  notes and the notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends 
also consistent with the prior facility  the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted ebitda interest coverage ratio of greater than ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda  defined as net income plus the sum of a interest expense  b income tax expense  c depreciation expense  d amortization expense  e any other non cash deductions  losses or changes made in determining net income for such period and f extraordinary losses or charges  minus extraordinary gains  in each case determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for such period  to interest expense for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters 
our consolidated interest coverage ratio was for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
a violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due  thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes 
cash priorities liquidity our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with our current credit ratings

table of contents pension plan our defined benefit pension plan had recorded unfunded pension obligations of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in both the years ended december  and  we made contributions of approximately million to the plan  including discretionary contributions of million and million  respectively 
due to the closure of one of our facilities in missouri and an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation  we funded million during we will be required to fund approximately million to the plan in and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million 
our most recent measurement date for our pension plan was december  the calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions expected long term return on plan assets  and discount rate 
we employ a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets 
historical markets are studied and long term historical risk  return  and co variance relationships between equities  fixed income securities  and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
consideration is given to diversification  re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held 
historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness 
we then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets 
the calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period 
our expected long term return on plan assets was for and for the expected long term return on plan assets is for as of december   pension plan target allocations were approximately in equity investments  in debt securities and in alternative investment strategies eg hedge funds  royalty rights and private equity funds 
hedge fund strategy types include  but are not limited to commodities currencies  equity long short  relative value  multi strategy  event driven  and global macro 
the plan holds derivative contracts directly which consist of standardized obligations to buy or sell united states treasury bonds or notes at predetermined future dates and prices which are transacted on regulated exchanges 
additionally  derivatives are held indirectly through funds in which the plan is invested 
derivatives are used by the plan to help reduce the plan s exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return 
cash held by the plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on the derivatives 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements  and periodic asset and liability studies 
the discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively 
the discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the plan to the rates from an aa spot rate yield curve 
the curve is derived from aa bonds of varying maturities 
the discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was and at december  and  respectively 
a basis point change to both the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years items related to amounts included on our balance sheet borrowings  including interest a irs agreement b estimated pension funding c unrecognized tax benefits d foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts e other f other contractual obligations purchase obligations g operating leases other h a we have estimated our interest payments based on i commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december   and the assumption that these commercial paper borrowings will be repaid upon maturity and that no new issuances will occur in  ii the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes  and iii an estimate of future interest rates on our floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements based on projected libor rates 
b in december  we reached an agreement with the irs resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in as a result of the irs agreement  we expect to make cash payments to the irs and various state tax authorities in totaling approximately million to cover the remaining portion of the additional tax and interest 
c we have estimated our pension plan funding requirements  including interest  using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates 
the unfunded pension liability included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is the present value of the estimated pension plan funding requirements disclosed above 
the actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated 
in addition  we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately million to the plan in  which has not been reflected in the table above 
d unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties 
the timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control 
e represents the liability position of our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts as of december   which will fluctuate based on market conditions 
f this line item relates to accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of december  g many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a terminations penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 

table of contents obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations 
h this line item includes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the united states and mexico border  which are expected to cost up to million over the next two years pursuant to the agreement and settlement with the state of arizona and other states

due to pending regulatory matters  this acquisition for cash consideration of million approximately million based on currency exchange rates at december  has not been finalized as of december  this acquisition is expected to close in  subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions 
other commercial commitments we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of december   with expiration dates through  the majority of which contain a one year renewal option 
the letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements 
we expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances
