a reconciliation between the reserves as of december  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles sap in the company s us regulatory filings is as follows amounts in thousands net reserves reported in us regulatory filings on a sap basis reserves for non us companies loss reserve discounting ceded reserves other gross reserves reported in the consolidated gaap financial statements for statutory purposes  the company discounts its workers compensation reinsurance reserves at as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 
in its gaap financial statements  the company discounts excess workers compensation reserves at the risk free rate and assumed workers compensation reserves at the statutory rate 
the following table presents the development of net reserves for through the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us 
the upper portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above 
it should be noted that the table presents a run off of balance sheet reserves  rather than accident or policy year loss development 
therefore  each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years 
for example  assume a claim that occurred in is reserved for  as of december  assuming this claim estimate was changed in to  and was settled for  in  the deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from through year ended december  amounts in millions net reserves  discounted reserve discount net reserves  undiscounted net reserves re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency  undiscounted cumulative amount of net liability paid through one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later the following table presents the development of gross reserves for through year ended december  amounts in millions net reserves  discounted ceded reserves gross reserves  discounted reserve discount gross reserves  undiscounted gross reserves re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later gross cumulative redundancy deficiency reinsurance we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write 
reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
as a result  generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of a excellent or better with at least million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of a excellent or better with at least million in policyholder surplus 
regulation us regulation our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
overview 
our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners 
this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the nature of and limitations on investments  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  approval of certain policy forms and premium rates  periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies  annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums  loss expenses and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
our property casualty subsidiaries  other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries  must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate 
our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 
holding company statutes 
in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries  we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems 
typically  such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner  including information concerning our capital structure  ownership  financial condition and general business operations 
under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase 
under alabama law  which is applicable to us due to our ownership of american mining insurance company  inc  an alabama domiciled insurance company  the acquisition of more than of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has recently adopted amendments to the model holding company law  expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems 
when and if adopted by the various states  these laws and regulations may have additional impact upon the company s operations 
risk based capital requirements 
the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the naic rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target 
these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control 
the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december  insurance regulatory information system 
the naic also has developed a set of financial ratios referred to as the insurance regulatory information system iris 
on the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators  the naic annually calculates these iris ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies 
the naic has established an acceptable range for each of the iris financial ratios 
guaranty funds 
our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants 
the protection afforded under a state s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state 
generally  all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund  and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums 
the naic model post assessment guaranty fund act  which many states have adopted  limits assessments to an insurer to of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting 
likewise  several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 
additionally  state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property liability shared market  pooling or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers 
shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or fair plans 
in addition  some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts 
our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state 
excess and surplus lines 
the regulation of our us subsidiaries excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business 
our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance 
although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business  strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future 
dividends 
we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services 
annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
trade practices 
state insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers  including provisions governing marketing and sales practices  policyholder services  claims management and complaint handling 
state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 
investment regulation 
investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind  quality and concentration of investments 
in general  these laws and regulations permit investments in federal  state and municipal obligations  corporate bonds  preferred and common equity securities  mortgage loans  real estate and certain other investments  subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications 
the terrorism risk insurance act 
the terrorism risk insurance act of  as amended collectively  tria  established a federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
the program is effective through december  tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto  burglary and theft  surety  professional liability and farm owners multi peril insurance 
insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism 
the most recent amendment to tria broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism 
federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism 
under the program  the federal government will pay of an insurer s covered losses in excess of the insurer s applicable deductible 
the insurer s deductible is based on percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance 
based on our earned premiums  our deductible under tria during will be approximately million 
the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed million 
tria limits the federal government s share of losses at billion for a program year 
in addition  an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the billion cap 
federal regulation 
although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which effects sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states 
the dodd frank act created two new federal government bodies  the federal insurance office the fio and the financial stability oversight council the fsoc  which may impact the regulation of insurance 
although the fio is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance  it has authority to represent the united states in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of state insurance laws 
the fio also can recommend to the fsoc that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the united states financial stability in the event of the insurer s material financial distress or failure 
an insurer so designated by fsoc could be subject to federal reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards 
based upon our current business model and balance sheet  we do not believe that we will be designated by the fsoc as such an institution 
although the potential impacts of the dodd frank act on the u 
s 
insurance industry is not clear  our business could be affected by changes to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non bank financial companies

berkley s business and results of operations  we are currently pursuing various alternatives in order to terminate w

berkley corporation s status as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company 
international regulation our insurance subsidiaries based in the united kingdom are regulated by the financial services authority the fsa 
the fsa oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements  risk assessment reviews  minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements  dividend restrictions  restrictions governing the appointment of key officers  restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements 
our lloyd s syndicate is also regulated by the fsa and lloyd s 
through lloyd s  we are licensed to write business throughout the world by virtue of lloyd s international licenses 
in each such country  we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country 
additionally  fsa regulations also impact us as controller an fsa defined term of our uk regulated subsidiaries 
through the fsa s approved persons regime  certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the fsa of their fitness and certain employees are individually registered at lloyd s 
the european union s executive body  the european commission  is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to our businesses across the european union beginning as soon as the first quarter of solvency ii provides for the supervision of group solvency 
under solvency ii  it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary s capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed equivalent to solvency ii 
while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us  we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our us and international companies will be materially impacted 
our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in continental europe  south america  australia  southeast asia and canada 
generally  our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements 
while each country imposes licensing  solvency  auditing and financial reporting requirements  the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially 
key areas where country regulations may differ include i the type of financial reports to be filed  ii a requirement to use local intermediaries  iii the amount of reinsurance permissible  iv the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates  and v the type and frequency of regulatory examinations 
competition the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive  with many insurance companies of various sizes  as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self insured retentions or captive programs  transacting business in the united states and internationally 
we compete directly with a large number of these companies 
competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer 
our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions 
our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a company wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 
as a result of increased competition  since we have generally been experiencing both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions 
however  in rates and terms in the united states and international markets were generally stable and or showed modest improvements  although certain products continue to experience strong competition 
competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers  regional carriers  large national multi line companies and reinsurers 
over the last few years  many of our specialty companies have reduced their writing substantially as standard carriers had increasingly competed for excess and surplus business  although this trend moderated in competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers  which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market 
these competitors include swiss re  munich re  berkshire hathaway  transatlantic reinsurance  and partner re 
additionally  in recent years our reinsurance writings have reduced substantially as many ceding companies elected to retain more business and the business available has been more competitive 
our regional subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers 
additionally  direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees  generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 
our international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small  which in some cases are related to government entities  as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 
additionally  competition from insurers and reinsurers based in bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions continues to increase  including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses 
employees as of february   we employed  individuals 
of this number  our subsidiaries employed  persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company 
other information about the company s business we maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 
seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes  hurricanes  hailstorms  earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance  they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 
we have no customer which accounts for percent or more of our consolidated revenues 
compliance by w 
r 
berkley and its subsidiaries with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to protection of the environment  has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position

risk factors our businesses face significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs  our businesses  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition to those described below  our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 
risks relating to our industry our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions  while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business 
in recent years  we have faced increased competition in our business  as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share  resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions 
the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims  which are influenced by many factors  including natural disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses 
in addition  investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy and recently the federal reserve has indicated its intention to keep interest rates at historic lows through late these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported 
these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses  which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 
we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and us insurers and reinsurers  other regional companies  as well as mutual companies  specialty insurance companies  underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies  some of which have implicit or explicit government support 
competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors  including premium charges  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  commissions paid to producers  the perceived financial strength of the company  other terms and conditions offered  services provided including ease of doing business over the internet  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 
some of our competitors  particularly in the reinsurance business  have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors within the reinsurance segment include swiss re  munich re  berkshire hathaway  transatlantic reinsurance  and partner re 
we expect that perceived financial strength  in particular  will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 
certain of our competitors operate from bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages 
over the past several years  we have faced increased competition in our business  particularly in our reinsurance and specialty segments  as increased supply has led to reduced prices and  at times  less favorable terms and conditions 
our specialty segment has also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share 
although policy rates and terms for these lines of business generally stabilized or showed modest improvements in  we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions 
this intense competition could cause the supply and or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change  which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
if we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims  which may require us to establish additional reserves 
our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately billion as of december  our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred  whether known or unknown 
the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  inflation  judicial theories of liability  reinsurance coverage  legislative changes and other factors  including the actions of third parties  which are beyond our control 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached 
in periods with increased economic volatility  it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs 
it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions 
reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
should we need to increase our reserves  our pre tax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount 
we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid 
discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities 
the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience 
changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined 
if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated  the discount will be reduced and pre tax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include  but are not limited to judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability  plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  including us  in purported class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices  medical developments that link health issues to particular causes  resulting in liability claims  claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies  including cyber security related risks  and claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions 
in some instances  these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued 
in addition  the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue  to remove limitations on recovery  to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as a property casualty insurer  we face losses from natural and man made catastrophes 
property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results 
for example  weather related losses were million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  tsunamis  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires  as well as terrorist activities 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas  however  hurricanes  earthquakes  tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large  heavily populated areas 
catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  and most of our past catastrophe related claims have resulted from severe storms 
seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses 
insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred 
it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if such conditions continue 
the significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued 
although the us and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets  the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear 
therefore  volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time 
while we monitor conditions in the financial markets  we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
depending on conditions in the financial markets  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods  and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with  including insureds and reinsurers 
we  as a primary insurer  may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 
to the extent an act of terrorism  whether a domestic or foreign act  is certified by the secretary of treasury  we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of  as amended tria  for up to of our losses for certain property casualty lines of insurance 
however  any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance 
based on our earned premiums  our deductible under tria during is approximately million 
tria is in effect through december  unless extended or replaced by a similar program 
the coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 
our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions 
as compared to a number of our competitors  we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written 
we purchase less reinsurance  the process by which we transfer  or cede  part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company  thereby retaining more risk 
as a result  our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this system of regulation  generally administered in the united states by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business  relates to  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting  rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses  and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
our international business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the united states 
the dodd frank act established the financial stability oversight council fsoc  which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant non bank financial companies  including insurance companies  be regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve 
the dodd frank act also established a federal insurance office fio and authorized the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws 
fsoc and the fio are authorized to study  monitor and report to congress on the us insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the us insurance market 
the potential impact of the dodd frank act on the us insurance business is not clear 
our business could be affected by changes  whether as a result of the dodd frank act or otherwise  to the us system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non bank financial companies 
as a result of its direct majority ownership interest in peyton street independent financial services corporation  a thrift holding company  and indirect majority ownership stake in insurbanc  a federal savings bank  w

berkley corporation is a grandfathered savings and loan holding company and  under the dodd frank act  is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve 
as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company  w 
r 
berkley corporation may be subject to certain requirements and restrictions  including those related to its shareholders  management reporting  capital adequacy  dividends and distributions  transactions with affiliates and compensation plans 
although us state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance  in addition to the changes brought about by the dodd frank act  congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter  repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the mccarran ferguson act  and tax law changes 
we may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution 
with respect to international measures  solvency ii  the eu directive concerning the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the european parliament in april  may affect our insurance businesses 
implementation of solvency ii by eu member states  which is anticipated at the beginning of  may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance 
in addition  solvency ii may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our eu domiciled insurers 
additionally  our capital requirements may be adversely affected if the eu commission finds that the insurance regimes of our third country domiciled companies are not equivalent to the requirements of solvency ii 
we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
also  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry  whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  may further restrict the conduct of our business 
risks relating to our business we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion  if at all  and  as a result  we could experience losses 
we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed  known as ceding  to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  it does not relieve us  the reinsured  of our liability to our policyholders 
our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  and if our reinsurers fail to pay us  our financial results would be adversely affected 
underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims 
as of december   the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately  million  including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk 
certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 
we are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders  independent agents and brokers 
in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio  we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business  including credit risk relating to policyholders  independent agents and brokers 
for example our policyholders  independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds 
as credit risk is generally a function of the economy  we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn 
while we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines  collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms  our efforts may not be successful 
for example  to reduce such credit risk  we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us 
in cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations  we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy 
in cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations  we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit 
we are rated by am best  standard poor s  and moody s  and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best  standard poor s and moody s investors 
our ratings are subject to periodic review  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings 
if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  standard poor s or moody s  our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims paying and financial strength ratings 
if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries  especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits 
we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal  and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing 
if we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments  especially catastrophe exposed risks 
depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy  we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed 
if conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable  we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed  which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries and or to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business  such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures  and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so  on terms acceptable to us 
our international operations expose us to investment  political and economic risks  including foreign currency and credit risk 
our expanding international operations in the united kingdom  continental europe  south america  australia  the asia pacific region  scandinavia and canada expose us to increased investment  political and economic risks  including foreign currency and credit risk 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our investments in non us denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in non us securities and currency markets  and those markets can be volatile 
non us currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non us subsidiaries to their parent companies in the us we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do  we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 
as part of our present strategy  we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis  and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures  that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or start up ventures will be successful 
the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel  including our chairman and ceo  president and coo  senior executive officers  presidents of our operating units  experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business 
if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases  we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate  and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 
if we experience difficulties with our information technology  telecommunications or other computer systems  our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted 
our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion 
a shut down of  or inability to access  one or more of our facilities  a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  terrorist attack or industrial accident  or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus  our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time 
in addition  because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption 
if our business continuity plans do not sufficiently address such a business interruption  system failure or service denial  our ability to write and process new and renewal business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed 
failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
computer viruses  hackers  employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches 
in addition  we routinely transmit and receive personal  confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means 
our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security 
while we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these third party vendors and others with whom we do business  we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and  in addition  these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred 
our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information  whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors  could result in significant monetary and reputational damages 
these increased risks  and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security  could expose us to data loss  monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs 
as a result  our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines  policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective 
our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting  claim processing and investment activities  many of which are highly complex 
these activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies  as well as legal and regulatory standards  including those related to privacy  anti corruption  anti bribery and global finance and insurance matters 
our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
if our controls are not effective  it could lead to financial loss  unanticipated risk exposure including underwriting  credit and investment risk or damage to our reputation 
risks relating to our investments a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations 
our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately billion  or of our total investment portfolio 
as of that date  our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities us government securities  state and municipal securities  corporate securities  mortgage backed securities and foreign government and corporate bonds 
the fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise 
conversely  if interest rates decline  investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower 
some fixed maturity securities  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  given the historically low interest rate environment  we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals 
the value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer  default by the issuer including states and municipalities in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities and or increases in market interest rates 
to a large degree  the credit risk we face is a function of the economy  accordingly  we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession 
although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low  our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue 
the economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits  the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuer s ability to perform its obligations thereunder 
additionally  our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest  as well as risks inherent in particular securities 
although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal  our efforts may not be successful 
impairments  defaults and or rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses 
investment returns are currently  and will likely continue to remain  under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets  economic uncertainty  more generally  and the shape of the yield curve 
as a result  our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we invest some of our assets in equity securities  merger arbitrage securities  investment funds  private equity and real estate related assets  which may decline in value 
we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities  merger arbitrage securities  investment funds  private equity and real estate related assets and have recently increased our investments in these asset classes as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment 
at december   our investment in these assets was approximately billion  or  of our investment portfolio 
we reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately  in  million in and million in  and losses from investment funds of million in  and million in merger and arbitrage trading securities were million  or  of our investment portfolio at december  merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers 
merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period  usually four months or less 
our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals  which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 
investments in real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were million  or  of our investment portfolio at december  the values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and real estate valuations in particular 
these investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  our investments in real estate related assets are less liquid than our other investments 
risks relating to purchasing our securities we are an insurance holding company and  therefore  may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts 
as an insurance holding company  our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations  paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses 
the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries  as well as regulatory restrictions 
during  the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately million 
as a result  in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations  pay dividends or repurchase shares 
laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay  deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable  and may restrict a stockholder s ability to purchase our common stock 
generally  united states insurance holding company laws require that  before a person can acquire control of an insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is domiciled 
pursuant to applicable laws and regulations  control over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of that insurer for alabama domiciled insurers  such as us due to our ownership of american mining 
indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock 
thus  the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common stock 
some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates  on the one hand  and the target insurer and its affiliates  on the other hand  have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state 
additionally  many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements 
while these provisions may not require acquisition approval  they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering  delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as state insurance statutes  may hinder  delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control 
these provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors 
these provisions include our classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships  the requirement that of our stockholders must approve mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of or more of our shares  unless the transaction was approved by our board of directors prior to such holder s acquisition of of our shares  and the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders meetings 
these provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable

berkley corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the united states and operates in five business segments specialty  regional  alternative markets  reinsurance and international 
our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches 
it also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics 
while providing our business units with certain operating autonomy  our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital  investment and reinsurance management  and actuarial  financial and corporate legal staff support 
the company s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments 
an important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities  with of our units formed since these newer units are focused on important parts of the economy in the us  including healthcare  energy and agriculture  and on growing international markets  including norway  australia  the asia pacific region and south america 
as a result  our international operations have become an increasingly important part of our business 
the profitability of the company s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates 
the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time a property casualty insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported 
the ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims  which are influenced by many factors  including natural and other disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses 
general insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity  ie  the level of policyholders surplus employed in the industry  and the industry s willingness to deploy that capital 
beginning in  the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines 
increased competition and the impact of the economic downturn also put pressure on policy terms and conditions 
while prices began to increase in  loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the company to achieve its return objectives 
recently  there have been increased signs of a hardening market  and  with its investments in new businesses  the company believes it is well positioned to take advantage of new opportunities 
price changes are reflected in the company s results over time as premiums are earned 
the company s profitability is also affected by its investment income 
the company s invested assets  which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business  are invested principally in fixed maturity securities 
the return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates  which are at historically low levels  as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities 
the company also invests in equity securities  merger arbitrage  private equity investments  investment funds and real estate 
critical accounting estimates the following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses  assumed premiums and other than temporary impairments of investments 
management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
reserves for losses and loss expenses 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  either known or unknown  insurers establish reserves  which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred 
estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments  often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements 
such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the report of the loss to the insurer  the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer s payment of that loss 
in general  when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time 
the estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim 
reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported ibnr to the insurer  potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process 
reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided 
in examining reserve adequacy  several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses 
these factors include  among other things  historical data  legal developments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
the actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
reserve amounts are based on management s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data 
as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  these estimates and judgments may be revised 
this may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed 
the risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have increased under the current financial market conditions 
it is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions 
whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation  increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation 
a change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our operations in periods in which such assumptions are changed 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost 
while the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time  some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors  including the actions of third parties which are beyond the company s control 
these variables are affected by external and internal events  such as inflation and economic volatility  judicial and litigation trends  reinsurance coverage  legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices  which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  the company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
loss reserves included in the company s financial statements represent management s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations 
the company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit 
these methods include paid loss development  incurred loss development  paid and incurred bornhuetter ferguson methods and frequency and severity methods 
in circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others  that method is used to set the point estimate 
for example  the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data 
for new lines of business  where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data  or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices  the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods 
the actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered 
industry loss experience is used to supplement the company s own data in selecting tail factors and in areas where the company s own data is limited 
the actuarial data is analyzed by line of business  coverage and accident or policy year  as appropriate  for each operating unit 
the establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses 
these qualitative considerations include  among others  the impact of re underwriting initiatives  changes in the mix of business  changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions 
examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits  the expansion of coverage exclusions  whether or not defense costs are within policy limits  and changes in deductibles and attachment points 
the key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios  rate of loss cost inflation  and reported and paid loss emergence patterns 
expected loss ratios represent management s expectation of losses at the time the business is written  before any actual claims experience has emerged 
this expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider 
expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes  loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten 
expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit 
expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the long tail lines  such as excess casualty  and claims with a high medical component  such as workers compensation 
reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value 
loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses  and are derived from the company s own experience and industry data 
the paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns 
management believes the estimates and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred  however  different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates 
loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves  including expected loss ratios  rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns 
loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims 
factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns 
factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits  retentions  rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 
another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag  which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company 
the length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses less ibnr is required for lines with short reporting lags 
as a result  loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates 
for lines with short reporting lags  which include commercial automobile  primary workers compensation  other liability claims made and property business  the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date 
for lines of business with long reporting lags  which include other liability occurrence  products liability  excess workers compensation and liability reinsurance  the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider 
historically  the company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags 
the key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted  to the extent necessary  to reflect historical changes  current trends and other factors observed 
if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected  the ultimate losses will be different than management s estimate 
the following table reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity  relative to our assumptions  on our loss estimate for claims occurring in dollars in thousands frequency severity our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately billion as of december  relate to multiple accident years 
therefore  the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 
approximately billion  or  of the company s net loss reserves as of december  relate to assumed reinsurance business 
there is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based  in part  upon information received from ceding companies 
if information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct  the company s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate 
furthermore  due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies  the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended 
management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors 
information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios  to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business 
this information  which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries  is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies 
the company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the company 
the information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the company s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks

for the year ended december   estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by million 
the favorable reserve development in was primarily attributable to accident years through the changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends 
original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends 
specialty the majority of the favorable reserve development for the specialty segment during and was associated with excess and surplus e s casualty business 
e s insurers are free from rate and form regulation and generally charge higher rates for business than those that are charged in the standard market 
beginning in  the e s business began to experience improved claim frequency ie  a lower number of reported claims per unit of exposure 
one reason for the lower number of claims was the company s introduction of more restrictive policy language which included additional exclusions that eliminated claims that would have previously been covered  particularly for the company s building contractor business 
in addition  as standard carriers tightened their underwriting criteria  the company benefited from an influx of accounts from the standard market to the e s market during these years 
the more restrictive policy language and the influx of standard market business resulted in an improved risk profile within the e s business and a reduction in loss costs that was not expected at the time loss reserves were initially established 
in addition  loss severity trends for e s casualty business have been lower than we had initially expected for the to period 
we began to recognize these trends in and have continued to reduce our estimates of ultimate claim costs since then as the magnitude of the frequency trends has become more evident 
the favorable reserve development in was primarily attributable to accident years through regional the favorable reserve development for the regional segment during was primarily related to the general liability portion of commercial multi peril business and to commercial automobile liability business 
the favorable reserve development resulted mainly from lower loss emergence on known case reserves relative to historical levels 
the favorable reserve development was primarily attributable to accident years through alternative markets the favorable reserve development for the alternative markets segment during was related to a decrease in prior year reserves for primary workers compensation business and  to a lesser extent  for medical excess business  partially offset by an increase in prior year reserves for excess workers compensation business 
the majority of favorable reserve development for primary workers compensation was related to california business  where the impact of legislative reforms continues to be reflected in improved loss trends 
the increase in loss reserves for excess workers compensation business was related primarily to increased medical and pharmaceutical costs associated with certain long term disability claims 
reinsurance the favorable development for the reinsurance segment during was related to umbrella and professional liability treaty business  facultative business and to business written through lloyd s of london 
the favorable development for the segment was spread across underwriting years through and resulted from lower than expected reported losses 
international the favorable reserve development for the international segment during was primarily related to property business written in by our lloyd s syndicate and asia pacific reinsurance business 
loss reserve discount the company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid 
discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities 
the expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the company s loss payout experience 
for non proportional business  reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk free discount rates determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve 
for proportional business  reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware of 
as of december   the aggregate blended discount rates ranged from to  with a weighted average discount rate of 
the aggregate net discount  after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance  was million and million as of december  and december   respectively

the company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts 
these premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the company by the ceding companies 
as estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised  the related amount of earned premiums  commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded 
estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements  information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements  reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries 
the company also considers its own view of market conditions  economic trends and experience with similar lines of business 
these premium estimates represent management s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements 
other than temporary impairments otti of investments 
the cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be other than temporary 
an other than temporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity 
since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity  the company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 
the company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating  primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies 
for purposes of classifying securities with different ratings  the company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned  unless the company s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate 
securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the company on a case by case basis 
fixed maturity securities for securities that we intend to sell or  more likely than not  would be required to sell  a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be otti 
the amount of otti is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell  a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an otti if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security ie  the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
the portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss ie  the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security is recognized in earnings 
the portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss ie  the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security is recognized in other comprehensive income 
impairment assessments for structured securities  including mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt  are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management 
modeling these securities involves various factors  such as projected default rates  the nature and realizable value of the collateral  if any  the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments  historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors 
if an otti determination is made  a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment

the security has met its contractual obligations and the company expects that it will continue to meet those contractual payment obligations as they become due 
based on this evaluation  the company does not consider the investment to be otti 
the company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sector related factors rather than to issuer specific factors

loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies  if appropriate 
fair value measurements 
the company s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for similar assets in active markets 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available 
the fair value of the vast majority of the company s portfolio is based on observable data other than quoted prices and  accordingly  is classified as level in classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy  the company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable 
the company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information 
the company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers  the uninterrupted availability of such inputs  the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time 
if the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable  the security is categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy 
because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis  the company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions 
for publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable  the company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data 
for securities traded only in private negotiations  the company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities  which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer  financial data  projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information 
the following is a summary of pricing sources for the company s fixed maturity securities available for sale as of december  dollars in thousands carrying value percent of total pricing source independent pricing services syndicate manager directly by the company based on observable data cash flow model total independent pricing services the vast majority of the company s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services generally one us pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the company 
the prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets eg  broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities 
the determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class 
the company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities 
if the prices appear unusual to the company  they are re examined and the value is either confirmed or revised 
in addition  the company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced 
as of december   the company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services 
based upon the company s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services  these securities were classified as level syndicate manager the company has a participation in a lloyd s syndicate  and the company s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate s manager 
the majority of the securities are liquid  short duration fixed maturity securities 
the company reviews the syndicate manager s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices 
based upon the company s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager  these securities were classified as level observable data if independent pricing is not available  the company prices the securities directly 
prices are based on observable market data where available  including current trading levels for similar securities and non binding quotations from brokers 
the company generally requests two or more quotes 
if more than one quote is received  the company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security 
the company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers 
since these securities were priced based on observable data  they were classified as level cash flow model if the above methodologies are not available  the company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads  interest rates and interest rate volatility  time to maturity and subordination levels 
discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate

fixed maturity securities

the company s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return 
the key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates  credit spreads and currency values 
in a period in which management expects interest rates to rise  the company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio 
similarly  in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen  the company may sell lower quality securities  and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value  the company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies

reinsurance the company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for  paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes 
reinsurance is purchased by the company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage 
the company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers

the majority of non rated and other consists of amounts due from government sponsored reinsurers and amounts that are secured by letters of credit or other forms of collateral 
many states require licensed insurers that provide workers compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis 
insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies 
the company acts as a servicing carrier for workers compensation pools in states 
as a servicing carrier  the company writes residual market business directly and then cedes of this business to the respective pool 
as a servicing carrier  the company receives fee income for its services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the fair value of the company s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates 
the company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities ie  policy claims and debt obligations 
the average duration for the fixed maturity portfolio was years at december  and december  in addition  the fair value of the company s international investments is subject to currency risk

government securities state and municipal corporate foreign mortgage backed securities loans receivable total duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates 
the company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities  assuming parallel shifts in the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static 
the estimated fair value at specified levels at december  would be as follows dollars in thousands change in interest rates estimated fair value change in fair value basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period usually four months or less 
the company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions 
potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies  including short sales 
additionally  the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options  selling call options or entering into swap contracts 
the company s merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals  which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks
