item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a growth oriented master limited partnership mlp organized by anadarko to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream energy assets 
we currently operate in east and west texas  the rocky mountains colorado  utah and wyoming and the mid continent kansas and oklahoma and are engaged primarily in the business of gathering  processing  compressing  treating and transporting natural gas  condensate  ngls and crude oil for anadarko and third party producers and customers 
as of december   our assets consist of eleven gathering systems  seven natural gas treating facilities  seven natural gas processing facilities  one ngl pipeline  one interstate pipeline  and interests in a gas gathering system and a crude oil pipeline accounted for under the equity method 
significant financial highlights during the year ended december   include the following we completed two acquisitions the february acquisition of the platte valley gathering system and processing plant from a third party  and the july acquisition of anadarko s bison gas treating facility located in the powder river basin in northeastern wyoming 
see acquisitions under items and of this form k for additional information 
our stable operating cash flow enabled us to raise our distribution to per unit for the fourth quarter of  representing a increase over the distribution for the third quarter of  a increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of  and our eleventh consecutive quarterly increase 
we entered into an amended and restated million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the rcf to amend and restate our million revolving credit facility and issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item for additional information 
we issued an aggregate  common units to the public  generating net proceeds of million  including the general partner s proportionate capital contribution to maintain its general partner interest 
net proceeds from the two offerings were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes 
significant operational highlights during the year ended december   include the following gross margin total revenues less cost of product attributable to western gas partners  lp averaged per mcf for the year  representing a increase compared to the year ended december  throughput attributable to western gas partners  lp totaled  mmcf d for the year  representing a increase compared to the same period in

index to financial statements our operations the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this form k 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  our  the partnership or western gas partners refers to western gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries 
the partnership s general partner is western gas holdings  llc the general partner  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko petroleum corporation 
anadarko or parent refers to anadarko petroleum corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries  excluding the partnership and the general partner 
references to the partnership assets refer collectively to the assets owned by the partnership as of december  because of anadarko s control of the partnership through its ownership of our general partner  each acquisition of partnership assets through december   except for those from third parties  was considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
as a result  after each acquisition of assets from anadarko  we are required to revise our financial statements to include the activities of the partnership assets as of the date of common control 
as such  our historical financial statements have been recast in this form k to include the results attributable to the bison assets as if we owned such assets for all periods presented 
the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets have been prepared from anadarko s historical cost basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if we had owned the assets during the periods reported 
for ease of reference  we refer to the historical financial results of the partnership assets prior to our acquisitions as being our historical financial results 
affiliates refers to wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries of anadarko  excluding the partnership  and also refers to fort union gas gathering  llc fort union and white cliffs pipeline  llc white cliffs 
our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas and ngls we gather  process  treat or transport through our systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of our throughput was attributable to transactions with anadarko 
in our gathering operations  we contract with producers and customers to gather natural gas from individual wells located near our gathering systems 
we connect wells to gathering lines through which natural gas may be compressed and delivered to a processing plant  treating facility or downstream pipeline  and ultimately to end users 
we also treat a significant portion of the natural gas that we gather so that it will satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation 
we received significant dedications from our largest customer  anadarko  solely with respect to the gathering systems connected to the wattenberg field and the gathering systems included in our initial assets 
specifically  anadarko has dedicated to us all of the natural gas production it owns or controls from i wells that are currently connected to such gathering systems  and ii additional wells that are drilled within one mile of wells connected to such gathering systems  as those systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect additional wells in the future 
as a result  this dedication will continue to expand as long as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was attributed to fee based contracts  under which a fixed fee is received based on the volume and thermal content of the natural gas we gather  process  treat or transport 
this type of contract provides us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk  except to the extent that we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead 
fee based gross margin includes equity income from our interests in fort union and white cliffs 
certain of our fee based contracts contain keep whole provisions 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was attributed to percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts  pursuant to which we have commodity price exposure  including gross margin attributable to condensate sales 
we have fixed price swap agreements with anadarko to manage the commodity price risk inherent in substantially all of our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts 
see note transactions with affiliates of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low natural gas prices have caused and may continue to cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production in certain areas  which would reduce the volumes of natural gas available for our systems 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk through settlement of natural gas imbalances 
please read item a of this form k 
as a result of our initial public offering and subsequent acquisitions from anadarko and third parties  the results of operations  financial position and cash flows may vary significantly for  and as compared to future periods 
please see the caption items affecting the comparability of our financial results  set forth below in this item how we evaluate our operations our management relies on certain financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include throughput  gross margin  operating and maintenance expenses  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput 
throughput is an essential operating variable we use in assessing our ability to generate revenues 
in order to maintain or increase throughput on our gathering and processing systems  we must connect additional wells to our systems 
our success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to our systems  recompletions of existing wells connected to our systems  our ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on non dedicated acreage and our ability to attract natural gas volumes currently gathered  processed or treated by our competitors 
during the year ended december   we added receipt points to our systems with initial throughput of approximately mmcf d per receipt point 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as total revenues less cost of product 
we consider gross margin to provide information useful in assessing our results of operations and our ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt 
cost of product expenses include i costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts  ii costs associated with the valuation of our gas imbalances  iii costs associated with our obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers  which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by us and sold to third parties  and iv costs associated with our fuel tracking mechanism  which tracks the difference between actual fuel usage and loss  and amounts recovered for estimated fuel usage and loss pursuant to our contracts 
these expenses are subject to variability  although our exposure to commodity price risk attributable to purchases and sales of natural gas  condensate and ngls is mitigated through our commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
operating and maintenance expenses 
we monitor operating and maintenance expenses to assess the impact of such costs on the profitability of our assets and to evaluate the overall efficiency of our operations 
operation and maintenance expenses include  among other things  field labor  insurance  repair and maintenance  equipment rentals  contract services  utility costs and services provided to us or on our behalf 
for periods commencing on and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  certain of these expenses are incurred under and governed by our services and secondment agreement with anadarko 
general and administrative expenses 
to help ensure the appropriateness of our general and administrative expenses and maximize our cash available for distribution  we monitor such expenses through comparison to prior periods  to the annual budget approved by our general partner s board of directors  as well as to general and administrative expenses incurred by similar midstream companies 
general and administrative expenses for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets include reimbursements attributable to costs incurred on our behalf and allocations of general and administrative costs by anadarko and the general partner to us 
for these periods  anadarko received compensation or reimbursement through a management services fee 
for periods subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  anadarko is no longer compensated for corporate services through a management services fee 
instead  we reimburse anadarko for general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with anadarko 
amounts required to be reimbursed to anadarko under the omnibus agreement include those expenses attributable to our status as a publicly traded partnership  such as the following expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution expenses  
table of contents 
index to financial statements expenses associated with listing on the new york stock exchange  and independent auditor fees  legal expenses  investor relations expenses  director fees  and registrar and transfer agent fees 
in addition to the above  pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement with anadarko  we are required to reimburse anadarko for allocable general and administrative expenses 
see further detail under items affecting the comparability of our financial results general and administrative expenses under the omnibus agreement below and note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to western gas partners  lp  plus distributions from equity investees  non cash equity based compensation expense  expense in excess of the omnibus cap  interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and impairments  and other expense  less income from equity investments  interest income  income tax benefit  other income and other nonrecurring adjustments that are not settled in cash 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions 
adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as industry analysts  investors  commercial banks and rating agencies  use to assess the following  among other measures our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 
distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda  plus interest income  less net cash paid for interest expense including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash  offset by non cash capitalized interest  maintenance capital expenditures  and income taxes 
we compare distributable cash flow to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this measure  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
we believe distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies  analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income  earnings per unit  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
furthermore  while distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period 
reconciliation to gaap measures 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not defined in gaap 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  and the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income attributable to western gas partners  lp 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the gaap measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp or net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
our definitions of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry  thereby diminishing their utility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow compared to as applicable net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
the following tables present a a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda to the gaap financial measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  and b a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of distributable cash flow to the gaap financial measure of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp year ended december  thousands reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to western gas partners  lp adjusted ebitda attributable to western gas partners  lp less distributions from equity investees non cash equity based compensation expense expenses in excess of omnibus cap interest expense income tax expense depreciation  amortization and impairments other expense add equity income  net interest income affiliates other income net income attributable to western gas partners  lp reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities adjusted ebitda attributable to western gas partners  lp adjusted ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests interest income expense  net expenses in excess of omnibus cap non cash equity based compensation expense current income tax expense other income expense  net distributions from equity investees less than in excess of equity income  net changes in operating working capital accounts receivable and natural gas imbalance receivable accounts payable  accrued liabilities and natural gas imbalance payable other net cash provided by operating activities includes our share of depreciation  amortization and impairments  other expense  and other income attributable to chipeta

these contract changes will impact the comparability of the statements of income and cash flows 
see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
commodity price swap agreements 
we have commodity price swap agreements with anadarko to mitigate exposure to commodity price volatility that would otherwise be present as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls 
notional volumes for each of the swap agreements are not specifically defined  instead  the commodity price swap agreements apply to the actual volume of our natural gas  condensate and ngls purchased and sold at the hilight  hugoton  newcastle  granger and wattenberg assets  with various expiration dates through september 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in december  we extended the commodity price swap agreements for the hilight and newcastle assets through december in december  we also entered into price swap agreements related to the acquisition of mountain gas resources  llc  with forward starting effective dates beginning january   and extending through december  see note transactions with affiliates and note subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
federal income taxes 
income earned by the partnership  a non taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes  including and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets was subject only to texas margin tax  while income earned prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets was subject to federal and state income tax 
general and administrative expenses under the omnibus agreement 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  anadarko and the general partner perform centralized corporate functions for the partnership 
prior to our ownership of the partnership assets  our historical consolidated financial statements reflect a management services fee representing the general and administrative expenses attributable to the partnership assets 
during the years ended december   and  anadarko billed us million  million and million  respectively  in allocated general and administrative expenses  which  prior to december   were subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
for the year ended december   anadarko  in accordance with the partnership agreement and omnibus agreement  determined  in its reasonable discretion  amounts to be allocated to us in exchange for services provided under the omnibus agreement 
in addition  our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  included million and million  respectively  of expenses incurred by anadarko and the general partner in excess of the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
such expenses were recorded as capital contributions from anadarko and did not impact the partnership s cash flows 
the amounts charged under the omnibus agreement are greater than amounts allocated to us by anadarko for the aggregate management services fees reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our ownership of the partnership assets 
we also incurred million  million and million in public company expenses  excluding equity based compensation  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense on intercompany balances 
for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta  we incurred interest expense or earned interest income on current intercompany balances with anadarko related to such assets 
these intercompany balances were extinguished through non cash transactions in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  the powder river acquisition  anadarko s initial contribution of assets of chipeta  the granger acquisition  wattenberg acquisition  interest in white cliffs and bison acquisition 
therefore  interest expense and interest income attributable to these balances are reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for the periods ending prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta 
platte valley acquisition 
in february  we acquired a natural gas gathering system and cryogenic gas processing facilities  collectively referred to as the platte valley assets  financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these assets  acquired from a third party  have been recorded in the partnership s consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date under the acquisition method of accounting 
results of operations attributable to the platte valley assets have been included our consolidated statements of income beginning on the acquisition date in the first quarter of the fair values of the plant and processing facilities  related equipment  and intangible assets acquired were based on the market  cost and income approaches 
the liabilities assumed include certain amounts associated with environmental contingencies estimated by management 
all fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent level inputs 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note acquisitions and note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further information 

table of contents 
index to financial statements general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on our assumptions and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about  or interpretations of  available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expectations 
impact of natural gas prices 
the relatively low natural gas price environment  which has persisted over the past three years  has led to lower levels of drilling activity served by certain of our assets 
several of our customers  including anadarko  have reduced activity levels in certain areas  shifting capital toward liquid rich opportunities that offer higher margins and superior economics to producers 
this trend has resulted in fewer new well connections and  in some cases  temporary curtailments of production 
to the extent opportunities are available  we will continue to connect new wells to our systems to mitigate the impact of natural production declines in order to maintain throughput on our systems 
however  our success in connecting new wells to our systems is dependent on the activities of natural gas producers and shippers 
changes in regulations 
our operations and the operations of our customers have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and are subject to an increasing number of complex federal  state  tribal  local and other laws and regulations such as production restrictions  permitting delays  limitations on hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations 
we and or our customers must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  tribal and local governmental authorities 
for example  regulation of hydraulic fracturing is currently primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements 
if proposed federal legislation is adopted  it could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting 
any changes in statutory regulations or delays in the issuance of required permits may impact both the throughput on and profitability of our systems 
access to capital markets 
we require periodic access to capital in order to fund acquisitions and expansion projects 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders  which makes us dependent upon raising capital to fund growth projects 
historically  mlps have accessed the debt and equity capital markets to raise money for new growth projects and acquisitions 
recent market turbulence has from time to time either raised the cost of those public funds or  in some cases  eliminated the availability of these funds to prospective issuers 
if we are unable either to access the public capital markets or find alternative sources of capital  our growth strategy may be more challenging to execute 
impact of inflation 
although inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years  the us economy could experience a significant inflationary effect from  among other things  the governmental stimulus plans enacted since to the extent permitted by regulations and escalation provisions in certain of our existing agreements  we have the ability to recover a portion of increased costs in the form of higher fees 
impact of interest rates 
interest rates were at or near historic lows at certain times during should interest rates rise  our financing costs would increase accordingly 
additionally  as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity  or increase the cost of issuing equity  to make acquisitions  reduce debt or for other purposes 
however  we expect our cost of capital to remain competitive  as our competitors would face similar circumstances 
acquisition opportunities 
as of december   anadarko s total domestic midstream asset portfolio  excluding the assets we own  consisted of nineteen gathering systems and ten processing and or treating facilities with an aggregate throughput of approximately bcf d  in addition to equity investments in two midstream projects not yet in service 
a key component of our growth strategy is to acquire midstream assets from anadarko and third parties over time 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as of december   anadarko owns a general partner interest in us  all of our idrs and a limited partner interest in us 
given anadarko s significant interests in us  we believe anadarko will benefit from selling additional assets to us over time  however  anadarko continually evaluates acquisitions and divestitures and may elect to acquire  construct or dispose of midstream assets in the future without offering us the opportunity to acquire or construct those assets 
should anadarko choose to pursue additional midstream asset sales  it is under no contractual obligation to offer assets or business opportunities to us 
we may also pursue certain asset acquisitions from third parties to the extent such acquisitions complement our or anadarko s existing asset base or allow us to capture operational efficiencies from anadarko s or third party production 
however  if we do not make additional acquisitions from anadarko or third parties on economically acceptable terms  our future growth will be limited  and the acquisitions we make could reduce  rather than increase  our cash flows generated from operations on a per unit basis

gathering  treating and transportation throughput decreased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to throughput decreases at the pinnacle  haley  dew and hugoton systems resulting from natural production declines and reduced drilling activity in those areas as a result of low natural gas prices 
these declines were partially offset by throughput increases at the wattenberg system due to increased drilling activity and recompletions driven by favorable producer economics in the area and the startup of the bison assets in june processing throughput increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to the additional throughput from the platte valley system acquired in february  as well as throughput increases at the chipeta and hilight systems  resulting from drilling activity in these areas driven by the relatively high liquid content of the gas volumes produced 
processing throughput increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to increased throughput at the chipeta system due to increased drilling activities in the natural buttes areas and at the granger system resulting from the temporary redirection of volumes from competing systems during the last half of equity investment volumes decreased by mmcf d for the year ended december   due to lower throughput at the fort union system following the startup of the bison pipeline

index to financial statements reconciliation to gaap measures 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not defined in gaap 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  while the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income attributable to western gas partners  lp 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the gaap measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp or net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
our definitions of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry  thereby diminishing their utility 
furthermore  while distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our performance and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow compared to as applicable net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for acquisitions and other capital expenditures  debt service  customary operating expenses  quarterly distributions to our limited partners and general partner  and distributions to our noncontrolling interest owners 
our sources of liquidity as of december   include cash flows generated from operations  including interest income on our million note receivable from anadarko  available borrowing capacity under our rcf  and issuances of additional common and general partner units or debt securities 
we believe that cash flows generated from the sources above will be sufficient to satisfy our short term working capital requirements and long term maintenance capital expenditure requirements 
the amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on results of operations  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner on a quarterly basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect to rely on external financing sources  including debt and common unit issuances  to fund expansion capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
however  to limit interest expense  we may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions  which could result in subsequent borrowings under our rcf to pay distributions or fund other short term working capital requirements 
our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash as defined in the partnership agreement to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within days of the end of each quarter 
we have made cash distributions to our unitholders and have increased our quarterly distribution each quarter since the second quarter of on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution to our unitholders of per unit  or million in aggregate  including incentive distributions 
the cash distribution is payable on february   to unitholders of record at the close of business on february  management continuously monitors our leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program  quarterly distributions and acquisition strategy with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule 
we will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including additional borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities  to secure funds as needed or to refinance outstanding debt balances with longer term notes 
to facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance  we have the ability to sell securities under our shelf registration statement 
our ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control

as of december   we had million of working capital  which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
working capital is an indication of our liquidity and potential need for short term funding 
our working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and factors such as credit extended to  and the timing of collections from  our customers and the level and timing of our spending for maintenance and expansion activity 
capital expenditures 
our business is capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities 
we categorize capital expenditures as either of the following maintenance capital expenditures  which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets  such as to replace system components and equipment that have been subject to significant use over time  become obsolete or reached the end of their useful lives  to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system throughput and related cash flows  or expansion capital expenditures  which include those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets  reduce costs  increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels  including well connections that increase existing system throughput

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods reported 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of properties and equipment  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
although these estimates are based on management s best available knowledge of current and expected future events  changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the audit committee of our general partner 
for additional information concerning our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
depreciation 
depreciation expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
determination of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property  plant and equipment 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes in the underlying assumptions are necessary 
the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
impairments of tangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
because acquisitions of assets from anadarko are transfers of net assets between entities under common control  the partnership assets acquired by us from anadarko are initially recorded at anadarko s historic carrying value 
assets acquired in a business combination or non monetary exchange with a third party are initially recorded at fair value 
property  plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment may be recognized 
any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
in assessing long lived assets for impairments  management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets carrying amounts 
since a significant portion of our revenues arises from gathering  processing and transporting the natural gas production from anadarko operated properties  significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by anadarko  to the extent they affect our operations  may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability 
such assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset  long range revenue and expense estimates  global and regional economic conditions  including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers  as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows 
the measure of impairments to be recognized  if any  depends upon management s estimate of the asset s fair value  which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions  if such data is available

index to financial statements impairments of goodwill 
goodwill represents the allocated portion of anadarko s midstream goodwill attributed to the assets the partnership has acquired from anadarko 
the carrying value of anadarko s midstream goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by anadarko 
accordingly  our goodwill balance does not reflect  and in some cases is significantly higher than  the difference between the consideration paid by us for acquisitions from anadarko compared to the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date 
we evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired annually  as of october  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
management has determined that we have one operating segment and two reporting units i gathering and processing and transportation 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december   was million for the gathering and processing reporting unit and million for the transportation reporting unit 
accounting standards require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level 
goodwill impairment assessment is a two step process 
step one focuses on identifying a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no further action is required 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to operating expense based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses information available to make these fair value estimates  including market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
specifically  management estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected ebitda 
management considered observable transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers  to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against our projected ebitda 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  throughput declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment test  we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated and no goodwill impairment has been recognized in these consolidated financial statements 
impairments of intangible assets 
our intangible asset balance at december   represents the fair value  net of amortization  of the contracts assumed by the partnership in connection with the platte valley acquisition in february these long term contracts  which dedicate certain customers field production to the acquired gathering and processing system  provide an extended commercial relationship with the existing customers whereby we will have the opportunity to gather and process future production from the customers acreage 
customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over years  which is the estimated productive life of the reserves covered by the underlying acreage ultimately expected to be produced and gathered or processed through the partnership s assets subject to current contractual arrangements 
management assesses intangible assets for impairment  together with the related underlying long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable 
impairments exist when an asset s carrying amount exceeds estimates of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the tested asset 
when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount are under consideration  estimates of future undiscounted cash flows take into account possible outcomes and probabilities of their occurrence 
if the carrying amount of the tested asset is not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its estimated fair value such that the asset s carrying amount is adjusted to its estimated fair value with an offsetting charge to operating expense 
no intangible asset impairment has been recognized in connection with these assets

index to financial statements fair value 
management estimates fair value in performing impairment tests for long lived assets and goodwill as well as for the initial measurement of asset retirement obligations and the initial recognition of environmental obligations assumed in third party acquisitions 
when management is required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  management utilizes the cost  income  or market valuation approach depending on the quality of information available to support management s assumptions 
the income approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment  since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future throughput  capital and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
a multiple approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected ebitda and multiple of that ebitda that a buyer would pay to acquire an asset 
management s estimates of future net cash flows and ebitda are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in our business plans and investment decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
the information pertaining to operating leases required for this item is provided under note commitments and contingencies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
recent accounting developments recently issued accounting standard not yet adopted 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update asu that permits an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
thus  determining a reporting unit s fair value is not required unless  as a result of the qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
this asu is effective prospectively beginning january  adoption of this asu will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
certain of our processing services are provided under percent of proceeds and keep whole agreements in which anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas and ngls 
under percent of proceeds agreements  we receive a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas and ngls 
under keep whole agreements  we keep of the ngls produced  and the processed natural gas  or value of the gas  is returned to the producer 
since some of the gas is used and removed during processing  we compensate the producer for this amount of gas by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed upon value for the gas utilized 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls  we currently have in place fixed price swap agreements with anadarko expiring at various times through december for additional information on the commodity price swap agreements  see note transactions with affiliates and note subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our contracts  we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas 
as part of this arrangement  we are required to provide a thermally equivalent volume of natural gas or the cash equivalent thereof to the shipper 
thus  our revenues for this portion of our contractual arrangement are based on the price received for the drip condensate and our costs for this portion of our contractual arrangement depend on the price of natural gas 
historically  drip condensate sells at a price representing a discount to the price of new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  west texas intermediate crude oil 
we consider our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above described arrangements to be minimal given the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with anadarko and the relatively small amount of our operating income that is impacted by changes in market prices 
accordingly  we do not expect a change in natural gas or ngl prices to have a material direct impact on our operating income  financial condition or cash flows for the next twelve months  excluding the effect of natural gas imbalances described below 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to settlement of our natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into our systems and gas volumes delivered by us to customers  as well as instances where our actual liquids recovery or fuel usage varies from the contractually stipulated amounts 
natural gas volumes owed to or by us that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates  and generally reflect market index prices 
other natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at our weighted average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in kind 
our exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances 
interest rate risk 
interest rates during and in were low compared to historic rates 
only our rcf carries interest at variable rates based on libor  and we did not have an outstanding balance as of december  if interest rates rise  our future financing costs could increase if we incur borrowings under our rcf 
we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement in march to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates prior to the issuance of the notes 
in may  we issued the notes and terminated the swap agreement  realizing a loss of million  which is included in other expense  net on our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   a change in libor would have resulted in a nominal change in net income 
we may incur additional debt in the future  either under our rcf or other financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances
