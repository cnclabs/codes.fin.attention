we qualify all of our forward looking statement by these cautionary statements 

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully read the risks described below and other information in this form k in order to understand certain of the risks of our business 
our business is heavily regulated and  as a result  decisions by regulatory agencies and changes in laws and regulations can significantly affect our business our revenues depend substantially on the rates and fees we charge our customers and the ability to recover our costs on a timely basis  including the ability to recover the costs of purchased water  groundwater assessments  electric power  natural gas  chemicals  water treatment  security at water facilities and preventative maintenance and emergency repairs 
any delays by the cpuc in granting rate relief to cover increased operating and capital costs at our public utilities or delays in obtaining approval of our requests for equitable adjustments or price redeterminations for contracted services from the us government may adversely affect our financial performance 
we may file for interim rates in california in situations where there may be delays in granting final rate relief during a general rate case proceeding 
if the cpuc approves lower rates  the cpuc will require us to refund to customers the difference between the interim rates and the rates approved by the cpuc 
similarly  if the cpuc approves rates that are higher than the interim rates  the cpuc may authorize us to recover the difference between the interim rates and the final rates 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses  may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses and could result in impairment of goodwill if the decision affects a subsidiary 
management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
in the event that our assessment of the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  we will adjust the associated regulatory asset or liability to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we are also  in some cases  required to estimate future expenses and in others  we are required to incur the expense before recovering costs 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may fluctuate depending on the accuracy of our estimates  the timing of our investments or expenses or other factors 
if expenses increase significantly over a short period of time  we may experience delays in recovery of these expenses  the inability to recover carrying costs for these expenses and increased risks of regulatory disallowances or write offs 
regulatory agencies may also change their rules and policies which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
changes in policies of the us government may also adversely affect our military base contract operations 
in certain circumstances  the us government may be unwilling or unable to appropriate funds to pay costs mandated by changes in rules and policies of federal or state regulatory agencies 
the us government may disagree with the increases that we request and may delay approval of requests for equitable adjustment or redetermination of prices which could adversely affect our anticipated rates of return 
we may also be subject to fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws  regulations or orders applicable to our businesses  unless we appeal this determination  or our appeal of an adverse determination is denied 
regulatory agencies may also disallow certain costs if audit findings determine that we have failed to comply with our policies and procedures for procurement or other practices 
our costs involved in maintaining water quality and complying with environmental regulation have increased and are expected to continue to increase our capital and operating costs have increased substantially as a result of increases in environmental regulation arising from increases in the cost of disposing of residuals from our water treatment plants  upgrading and building new water treatment plants  monitoring compliance activities and securing alternative supplies when necessary 
gswc may be able to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover these costs under settlement and contractual arrangements 
in certain circumstances  costs may be recoverable from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination  either voluntarily or through specific court action 
we may also incur significant costs in connection with seeking to recover costs due to contamination of water supplies 
our ability to recover these types of costs also depends upon a variety of factors  including approval of rate 
table of contents increases  the willingness of potentially responsible parties to settle litigation and otherwise address the contamination and the extent and magnitude of the contamination 
we can give no assurance regarding the adequacy of any such recovery to offset the costs associated with the contamination or the cost of recovery of any legal costs 
we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured we are  from time to time  parties to legal or regulatory proceedings 
these proceedings may pertain to regulatory investigations  employment matters or other disputes 
management periodically reviews its assessment of the probable outcome of these proceedings  the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred  and the availability and extent of insurance coverage 
on the basis of this review  management establishes reserves for such matters 
we may  however  from time to time be required to pay fines  penalties or damages that exceed our insurance coverage and or reserves if our estimate of the probable outcome of such proceedings proves to be inaccurate 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities 
however  our insurance policies contain exclusions and other limitations that may not cover our potential liabilities 
generally  our insurance policies cover property  worker s compensation  employer s liability  general liability and automobile liability 
each policy includes deductibles or self insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims 
as a result  we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured 
additional risks associated with our public utility operations our operating costs have increased and are expected to continue to increase as a result of groundwater contamination our operations are impacted by groundwater contamination in certain service territories 
we have taken a number of steps to address contamination  including the removal of wells from service  decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped from wells in order to slow the movement of plumes of contaminated water  constructing water treatment facilities and securing alternative sources of supply from other areas not affected by the contamination 
in emergency situations  we have supplied our customers with bottled water until the emergency situation has been resolved 
in some cases  potentially responsible parties have reimbursed us for some or all of our costs 
in other cases  we have taken legal action against parties believed to be potentially responsible for the contamination 
to date  the cpuc has permitted us to establish memorandum accounts for potential recovery of these types of costs 
we can give no assurance regarding the outcome of litigation arising out of contamination or our ability to recover the costs of litigation in the future 
persons who are potentially responsible for causing the contamination of groundwater supplies have asserted claims against water distributors on a variety of theories and have thus far brought the water distributors including gswc within the class of potentially responsible parties in federal court actions pending in los angeles county 
this increases the costs and risks of seeking recovery of these costs 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to appropriately manage these types of claims 
however  such claims  if ultimately resolved unfavorably to us  could  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of uncontrollable factors the adequacy of our water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall  runoff  flood control and availability of reservoir storage  availability of colorado river water and imported water from northern california  the amount of useable water stored in reservoirs and groundwater basins  the amount of water used by our customers and others  water quality  legal limitations on production  diversion  storage  conveyance and use  and climate change 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used in california have caused increased stress on surface water supplies and groundwater basins 
in addition  court ordered pumping restrictions on water obtained from the sacramento san joaquin delta may decrease the amount of water metropolitan water district of southern california  or 
table of contents mwd  is able to import from northern california 
we have implemented tiered rates and other practices in order to encourage water conservation 
we are also acting to secure additional supplies from desalination and water transfers 
however  we cannot predict to what extent these efforts to reduce stress on our water supplies will be successful or sustainable 
water shortages at gswc may adversely affect our supply mix  for instance  causing increased reliance upon more expensive water sources  adversely affect our operating costs  for instance  by increasing the cost of producing water from more highly contaminated aquifers  result in an increase in our capital expenditures  for example by requiring the construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers  and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water  and adversely affect the volume of water sold as a result of mandatory or voluntary conservation efforts by customers 
we may be able to recover increased operating and capital costs through the ratemaking process 
gswc has implemented a modified supply cost balancing account to track and recover costs from supply mix changes and rate changes by wholesale suppliers  as authorized by the cpuc 
we may also recover costs from certain third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in water supply costs we obtain our water supplies for gswc from a variety of sources 
for example  water is pumped from aquifers within our service areas to meet a portion of the demands of our customers 
when water produced from wells in those areas is insufficient to meet customer demand or when such production is interrupted  we have purchased water from other suppliers 
as a result  our cost of providing  distributing and treating water for our customers use can vary significantly 
furthermore  imported water wholesalers  such as mwd may not always have an adequate supply of water to sell to us 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by increases in maintenance costs due to our aging infrastructure some of our systems in california are more than years old 
we have experienced leaks and water quality and mechanical problems in some of these older systems 
in addition  well and pump maintenance expenses are affected by labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
although our maintenance costs for decreased as compared to  these costs can increase substantially and unexpectedly 
we include estimated increases in maintenance costs for future years in each general rate case filed by our rate regulated public utilities for possible recovery 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by our conservation efforts conservation by all customer classes at gswc is a top priority 
however  customer conservation can result in lower volumes of water sold 
we are also experiencing a decline in per residential customer water usage due to the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances by residential consumers  and perhaps  efforts by our customers to reduce costs 
our water utility business is heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used 
the rates we charge for water are regulated by the cpuc and may not be adequately adjusted to reflect changes in demand 
declining usage also negatively impacts our long term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the per customer residential usage decline 
we implemented a cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism at gswc which has the effect of reducing the adverse impacts of our customers conservation efforts on revenues 
however  cash flows from operations can 
table of contents be significantly affected as much of the revenues we recognize in these accounts are collected from customers primarily through surcharges over a twelve to thirty six month period 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons the demand for water and electricity varies by season 
for instance  most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather in california tends to be hot and dry 
during unusually wet weather  our customers generally use less water 
gswc has implemented a cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism  which should help mitigate fluctuations in revenues and earnings due to changes in water consumption by our customers in california 
the demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snows 
an increase in winter snows reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the big bear area and  as a result  reduces our electric revenues 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions  which also reduces our electric revenues 
gswc has implemented a base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism for our electric business which should help mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by gswc s electric customers 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by increases in electricity and natural gas prices in california we purchase most of our electric energy sold to customers in our electric customer service area from others under purchased power contracts 
in addition to purchased power contracts  we purchase additional energy from the spot market to meet peak demand 
we may sell surplus power to the spot market during times of reduced energy demand 
as a result  we are at risk for increases in spot market prices of electricity purchased and for decreases in spot market prices for electricity sold 
we also operate a natural gas fueled megawatt generator in our electric service area 
unexpected generator downtime or a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to our electric and natural gas purchase contracts could further increase our exposure to fluctuating natural gas and electric prices 
changes in electricity prices also affect the unrealized gains and losses on our block forward purchased power contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as we adjust the asset or liability on these contracts to reflect the fair market value of the contracts at the end of each month 
the cpuc has authorized us to establish a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of our purchased power contracts that became effective on january  as a result  unrealized gains and losses on these purchased power contracts do not impact earnings 
we may not be able to procure sufficient renewable energy resources to comply with cpuc rules we are required to procure a portion of our electricity from renewable energy resources 
due to our small size as compared to other energy utilities and the constrained renewable energy market  we have not been able to obtain sufficient resources to achieve the established interim target purchase levels 
we believe that we are permitted to defer compliance with these requirements under the cpuc s flexible compliance rules 
however  we may be subject to fines and penalties by the cpuc if the cpuc determines that we are not in compliance with the renewable resource procurement rules 
our assets are subject to condemnation municipalities and other government subdivisions may  in certain circumstances  seek to acquire certain of our assets through eminent domain proceedings 
it is generally our practice to contest these proceedings which may be costly and may divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 
if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring our assets  there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired or be able to recover all charges associated with the divestiture of these assets 

table of contents additional risks associated with our contracted services we derive revenues from contract operations primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems at military bases and the construction of water and wastewater improvements to the infrastructure on these bases 
as a result  these operations are subject to risks that are different than those of our public utility operations 
our operations and maintenance contracts on military bases create certain risks that are different from our public utility operations we have entered into contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at military bases pursuant to year contracts  subject to termination  in whole or in part  for the convenience of the us government 
in addition  the us government may stop work under the terms of the contracts  delay performance of our obligations under the contracts or modify the contracts at its convenience 
our contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials 
we may be unable to recover all costs if any of these assumptions are inaccurate or if all costs that we may incur in connection with performing the work were not considered 
our contracts are also subject to periodic price adjustments at the time of price redetermination or in connection with requests for equitable adjustments or other changes permitted by the terms of the contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
prices are also subject to equitable adjustment based upon changes in circumstances  laws or regulations and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
we have experienced delays in the redetermination of prices following completion of the first two years of operation under our contracts 
we have also experienced delays in obtaining a final equitable adjustment of prices for the significantly higher infrastructure at certain of the bases than that described by the us government in its request for proposal 
these delays have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
we are required to record all costs incurred under these types of contracts as these costs are incurred 
as a result  we may record losses associated with unanticipated conditions  higher than anticipated infrastructure levels and emergency work at the time such expenses occur 
we recognize revenue for such work as  and to the extent that  our price redeterminations and or requests for equitable adjustments are approved 
delays in obtaining approval of price redeterminations and or equitable adjustments can negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to audits  cost review and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
certain audit findings such as system deficiencies for government contract reporting requirements may result in delays in price redetermination filings 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 
payment under these contracts is subject to appropriations by congress 
we may experience delays in receiving payment or delays in redetermination of prices or other price adjustments due to cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects or reductions in government spending for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
management also reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
asus has million of goodwill which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and or equitable adjustments are not granted 
risks associated with the collection of wastewater are different  in some respects  from that of our water distribution operations the wastewater collection system operations of our subsidiaries providing wastewater services on military bases are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks 
if collection or sewage systems fail  overflow or do not operate properly  untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers  causing damage to persons or property  injury to aquatic life and economic damages  which may not be recoverable 
this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding  which are common causes of sewer 
table of contents overflows and system failures 
liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow  our losses might not be covered by insurance policies or we may find it difficult to secure insurance for this business in the future at acceptable rates 
our contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements on military bases create risks that are different  in some respects  from that of our operations and maintenance activities we have entered into contract modifications with the us government and in some cases third parties for the construction of new water and or wastewater infrastructure at the military bases 
most of these contracts are firm fixed price contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  we benefit from cost savings and earnings  but are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under extenuating circumstances  the us government has approved increased cost change orders 
we recognize revenues from these types of contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this accounting practice results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs or the physical completion of the construction projects 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on periodic estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability as the construction projects progress 
we establish prices for these types of firm fixed price contracts based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our contracted business operations and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by disputes with the us government regarding our performance of contract services on military bases if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows could be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of our us government contracts  other agreements with the us government or us government regulations and statutes  we could be suspended or barred from future us government contracts for a period of time and be subject to possible damages  fines and penalties and damage to our reputation in the water and wastewater industry 
we depend  to some extent  upon subcontractors to assist us in the performance of contracted services on military bases we rely  to some extent  on subcontractors to assist us in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at military bases 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform services for us in accordance with the terms of our contracts with the us government could result in the termination of our contract to provide water and or wastewater services at the affected base s  a loss of revenues or increases in costs to correct a subcontractor s performance failures 
we are able to mitigate these risks  in part  by obtaining and requiring our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds 
we are also required to make a good faith effort to achieve our small business subcontracting plan goals pursuant to us government regulation 
if we fail to use good faith efforts to meet these goals  the us government may assess damages against us at the end of the contract or  for most contracts  at the end of each price redetermination period 
the us government has the right to offset claimed damages against any amounts owed to us 
we also rely on third party manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our construction projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount of costs we incur for these projects exceeds the amount we have estimated in our bid  we could experience reduced profits or losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the 
table of contents negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
if these subcontractors fail to perform services to be provided to us or fail to provide us with the proper equipment or materials  we may be penalized for their failure to perform  however  our contracts with these subcontractors include certain protective provisions  which may include the assessment of liquidated damages 
we mitigate these risks by requiring many of our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds and to compensate us for any penalties we may be required to pay as a result of their failure to perform 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons seasonal weather conditions  such as hurricanes or significant winter storms  occasionally cause temporary office closures and or result in temporary halts to construction activity at military bases 
to the extent that our construction activities are impeded by these events  we will experience a delay in recognizing revenues from these construction projects 
we continue to incur costs associated with the expansion of our contract activities we continue to incur additional costs in connection with the attempted expansion of our contract operations associated with the preparation of bids for new contracts for contract operations on military bases 
our ability to recover these costs and to earn a profit on our contract operations will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in obtaining new contracts on military bases and recovering these costs and other costs from new contract revenues 
other risks our business requires significant capital expenditures the utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums of money for additions to  or replacement of  our property  plant and equipment at our water and electric utilities 
we obtain funds for these capital projects from operations  contributions by developers and others and advances from developers which are repaid over a period of time at no interest 
we also periodically borrow money or issue equity for these purposes 
in addition  we have a syndicated bank credit facility that is partially used for these purposes 
we cannot provide assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
our subsidiaries providing water and wastewater services on military bases also expect to incur significant capital expenditures 
to the extent that the us government does not reimburse us for these expenditures as the work is performed or completed  the us government will repay us over time 
however  if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions access to external financing on reasonable terms depends  in part  on conditions in the debt and equity markets 
when business and market conditions deteriorate  we may no longer have access to the capital markets on reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain funds is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity to third parties or obtaining funds from our revolving credit facility which expires in may in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets  additional consolidation of the financial services industry  significant financial service institution failures or our inability to renew or replace our existing revolving credit facility on attractive terms  it may become necessary for us to seek funds from other sources on unattractive terms 
payment of our debt may be accelerated if we fail to comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements our failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could result in an event of default 
if the default is not cured or waived  we may be required to repay or refinance this debt before it becomes due 
even if we are able to obtain waivers from our creditors  we may only be able to do so on unfavorable terms 

table of contents we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all operations and our only significant assets are investments in our subsidiaries 
this means that we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
asus has not paid any dividends to us during the past three years 
as a result  we are largely dependent on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt 
our subsidiaries only pay dividends if and when declared by the subsidiary board 
moreover  gswc is obligated to give first priority to its own capital requirements and to maintain a capital structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by the cpuc in its most recent decision on capital structure  in order that customers not be adversely affected by the holding company structure 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets in the unlikely event of liquidation or reorganization of gswc is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from gswc in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations  make additional investments or pay dividends 
we must successfully maintain and or upgrade our information technology systems as we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of these systems we rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations 
over the last few years  we have implemented and will continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems  including making changes to legacy systems  replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems 
these types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks including potential disruption of our internal control structure  substantial capital expenditures  additional administration and operating expenses  retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems  and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems 
in addition  the difficulties with implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations  if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated 
we rely on our computer  information and communications technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters  telecommunications  failures or acts of war or terrorism or similar events or disruptions 
any of these or other events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data or delay or prevent operations and adversely affect our financial results 
there have been an increasing number of cyber attacks on companies around the world  which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data 
these attacks have occurred over the internet  through malware  viruses or attachments to e mails or through persons inside the organization or with access to systems inside the organization 
we have implemented security measures and will continue to devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent cyber attacks 
despite our efforts  we cannot be assured that a cyber attack will not cause water or electric system problems  disrupt service to our customers  compromise important data or systems or result in unintended release of customer information 
our operations are geographically concentrated in california although we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states  our operations are concentrated in california  particularly southern california 
as a result  our financial results are largely subject to political  water supply  labor  utility cost and regulatory risks  economic conditions and other economic risks affecting california 
california has been particularly hard hit by the recent economic crisis 
california is  among other things  raising taxes in order to help balance the state budget and jobs may be lost to other states which are perceived as having a more business friendly climate  thereby exacerbating the impact of the financial crisis in california 

table of contents we operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
while we maintain insurance policies to help reduce our financial exposure  a significant seismic event in southern california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disasters in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
the cpuc has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account to recover these costs 
terrorists could seek to disrupt service to our customers by targeting our assets 
we have invested in additional security for facilities throughout our regulated service areas to mitigate the risks of terrorist activities

condemnation of properties the laws of the state of california provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain  also known as condemnation  where doing so is necessary and in the public interest 
in addition  these laws provide i that the owner of utility property may contest whether the condemnation is actually necessary and in the public interest  and ii that the owner is entitled to receive the fair market value of its property if the property is ultimately taken 
although the city of claremont  california the city located in gswc s region iii  has not initiated the formal condemnation process pursuant to california law  the city has expressed various concerns to gswc about the rates charged by gswc and the effectiveness of the cpuc s rate setting procedures 
on january   the claremont city council members directed staff to pursue analysis required for potential acquisition of the water system and allocated funds from its general reserve for such analysis 
gswc serves approximately  customers in claremont 
the town of apple valley the town abandoned its activities related to a potential condemnation of gswc s water system serving the town in however  in january  the town council directed staff to update the previously prepared financial feasibility study for the acquisition of gswc s water systems 
the town also created a blue ribbon water commission brwc to provide recommendations on the items pending before the cpuc associated with the two water companies including gswc serving the town

table of contents item legal proceedings water quality related litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in certain wells servicing gswc s south san gabriel system 
gswc filed suit in federal court  along with two other affected water purveyors and the san gabriel basin water quality authority  together known as the water entities  against some of those allegedly responsible for the contamination of two of these wells 
in response to the filing of the lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the prp s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyors  including gswc  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
gswc has amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
gswc is presently unable to predict an estimate range of loss  if any  in the event that gswc is deemed to be a prp  or on gswc s ability to fully recover from the prps  past and future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in portions of the san gabriel valley from which two gswc wells draw water 
the uao requires these parties to remediate the contamination 
on october   the judge in the lawsuit stayed the matter in order to allow the parties to explore settlement and appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
epa has also conducted settlement discussions with several prps regarding the uao 
the water entities and epa have worked closely to coordinate their settlement discussions under the auspices of the special master in order to arrive at a complete resolution of all issues affecting the lawsuit and the uao 
settlements have been reached with a majority of the prps 
on march   the court lifted the stay and the matter has proceeded in litigation 
the epa filed a separate complaint against the remaining prps and their matter was consolidated with those filed by the water entities 
since october  several day stays were granted to continue settlement discussions 
during these day stays  the epa and water entities have successfully reached settlements with most of the remaining prps 
on january   the stay was lifted and the case entered discovery phase as settlement negotiations with the remaining prps progress 
registrant believes it will reach settlements with all the prps 
however  registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
santa maria groundwater basin adjudication in  the santa maria valley water conservation district plaintiff filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants  including gswc  the city of santa maria  and several other public water purveyors 
the plaintiff s lawsuit sought an adjudication of the santa maria groundwater basin the basin 
a stipulated settlement of the lawsuit has been reached  subject to cpuc approval 
the settlement  among other things  if approved by the cpuc  would preserve gswc s historical pumping rights and secure supplemental water rights for use in case of drought or other reductions in the natural yield of the basin 
gswc  under the stipulation  has a right to  acre feet of groundwater replenishment provided by the twitchell project  a storage and flood control reservoir project operated by the santa maria valley conservation district 
a monitoring and annual reporting program has been established to allow the parties to responsibly manage the basin and to respond to shortage conditions 
if severe water shortage conditions are found over a period of five years  the management area engineer will make findings and recommendations to alleviate such shortages 
in the unlikely case that the basin experiences severe shortage conditions  the court has the authority to limit gswc s groundwater production to  acre feet per year  based on developed water in the basin 
over the last five years  gswc s average groundwater production has been  acre feet per year 
on february   the court issued its final judgment  which approves and incorporates the stipulation 
the judgment awards gswc prescriptive rights to groundwater against the non stipulating parties 
in addition  the judgment grants gswc the right to use the basin for temporary storage and to recapture percent of the return flows that are generated from its importation of state water project water 
pursuant to this judgment  the court retains jurisdiction over all of the parties to make supplemental orders or to amend the judgment as necessary 
on march   the non stipulating parties filed notices of appeal 
in august  the appellants filed their opening briefs 
registrant is unable to predict the outcome of the appeal

included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric margins 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the performance of gswc 
the discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present registrant s operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment 
registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of our differing services and information that could be indicative of future performance for each business segment 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget as approved 
however  these measures  which are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of water and electric margins to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in the table under the section titled operating expenses supply costs 
reconciliations to awr s diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled summary results by segment 
overview registrant s revenues  operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses  through our contracted services business for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater systems for the us government at various military bases  and through the delivery of electricity in the big bear area of san bernardino county  california 
rates charged to gswc customers are determined by the cpuc 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors affecting financial performance of gswc include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates  the costs of distributing water and electricity and our overhead costs  fines  penalties and disallowances by the cpuc arising from failures to comply with regulatory requirements  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by gswc to protect its water supply 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the cpuc to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years at gswc are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
when necessary  registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings 
on april   gswc sold million in aggregate principal amount of its notes 
the notes will mature on april  interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october  at the rate of per annum 
the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally with all of gswc s unsecured and unsubordinated debt 
the proceeds from the debt issuance were used to pay down short term borrowings from awr and other long term debt with a higher interest rate  and to fund capital expenditures 
all of the current operation and maintenance contracts with the us government are year firm  fixed price contracts with prospective price redeterminations 
additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of gswc 
factors affecting the financial performance of our military utility privatization subsidiaries include delays in receiving payments from the us government and the redetermination and equitable adjustment of prices under the contracts with the us government  fines  penalties or disallowance of costs by the federal government  and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment for a period of time from contracting with the federal government due to violations of federal law and regulations in connection with military utility privatization activities 
our financial performance is also dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate our costs in bidding on firm fixed price construction contracts and the costs of seeking new contracts for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater services at military bases and for additional construction work at existing bases 
on may  awr completed its sale of ccwc to epcor water usa inc for a final purchase price of million  including the assumption of approximately million of long term debt 
awr received approximately million in cash  which was used primarily to pay down short term borrowings 
the sale generated a gain net of taxes and transaction costs of approximately million

excluding the charge discussed above  operating expenses other than supply costs increased by approximately million  or per share  due primarily to i an increase in administrative and general expenses of million primarily due to higher labor and pension costs as well as a change in allocation methodology causing higher amounts of costs from the general office  allocated to the water segment and less to electric  ii an increase in depreciation expense of million resulting primarily from additions to utility plant  and iii a decrease of  in the pretax gain on the sale of property primarily due to the sale in of land that did not recur in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses due to a decrease in water treatment and planned and unplanned maintenance costs 
an increase in interest and other non operating expenses net of interest income of million  or per share  due primarily to i the issuance of million in new long term notes in april  of which million of the proceeds were used in may to redeem notes with higher interest rates  and ii interest income of million recorded in related to a proposed settlement reached with the internal revenue service related to awr s refund claims associated with a tax method change 
there was no similar amount of interest income recorded in an increase in the effective income tax rate for the water segment during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  decreasing water earnings by approximately per share  primarily resulting from changes between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements  and changes in other permanent items 
diluted earnings from electric operations increased by per share during the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in electric margin of  or per share  as compared to the same period in reflecting rate increases approved by the cpuc  partially offset by a one time  revenue increase for a cpuc approved general office allocation memorandum account recorded in in addition  a lower effective tax rate and lower other operating expenses due to less costs allocated from the general office to the electric segment  increased electric operations earnings by per share during the year ended december  
table of contents diluted earnings from contracted services were per share during the years ended december  and included in earnings for the year ended december  was million  or per share  of revenues and interest income in connection with contract modifications received by asus subsidiaries from the us government during  which were retroactive 
excluding the impact of these contract modifications received in  earnings from contracted services increased by per share during the year ended december  primarily due to i a change in estimated costs related to a pipeline project being completed at fort bragg  which resulted in an increase in pretax operating income of million  or per share  for work previously performed on the project  and ii an additional increase in construction margin of million or per share  due primarily to an overall increase in construction activities compared to  particularly at fort bliss and fort bragg 
these increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses in diluted earnings from awr parent increased by per share during the year ended december  there was a loss incurred on one of awr s investments in  which did not recur in the tables below set forth summaries of the results by segment of continuing operations amounts in thousands operating revenues pretax operating income year year year year ended ended ended ended change change change change water electric contracted services awr parent totals from operation discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  equivalent to per common share on a basic and fully diluted basis  compared to million or per common share on a basic and fully diluted basis  for the year ended december   an increase of per common share 
the increase is due primarily to the gain on sale of ccwc of million  net of taxes and transaction costs  or per share 
there was also a decrease in depreciation expense  which increased earnings by per share  and a favorable decision issued by the arizona corporation commission acc on april   which resulted in the recording of approximately  of pretax income  or per share

registrant relies on price redeterminations and equitable adjustments by the us government in order to recover operating expenses and provide profit margin for asus 
if adequate rate relief and price redeterminations and adjustments are not granted in a timely manner  operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in water revenues is primarily due to rate increases approved by the cpuc at all gswc water regions effective january  water consumption for the year ended december  decreased compared to the same period in while water sales in continue to decline  earnings have not been negatively impacted by the reduction in water sales as gswc has implemented a cpuc approved water revenue adjustment mechanism wram account in all three water regions as authorized by the cpuc

gswc filed a grc for all three water regions in july of with rates expected to be effective january electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased to million compared to million for due primarily to attrition year increases in electric rates approved by the cpuc effective january  the authorized rate increases provided bves with additional annual revenues of approximately million 
the increase in rates was partially offset by the recording of  in revenue during the first quarter of that was included in a memorandum account approved by the cpuc which tracked the difference between the adopted general office cost allocation to bves and the adopted general office cost allocation to bves 
there was no similar revenue recorded in in addition  total electric supply costs decreased by  during the year ended december   which reduced electric revenues by a corresponding amount  but had no impact on the dollar margin for electric services 
electric usage for the year ended december  increased compared to the same period in due to the cpuc approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism  which adjusts certain revenues to adopted levels  this change in usage did not have a significant impact on earnings 
contracted services revenues from contracted services consist primarily of construction revenues including renewals and replacements and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and or wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   construction revenues increased by million primarily due to an increase in construction activities at fort bliss and fort bragg 
additionally  as a result of a change in estimated costs by onus on a water and wastewater pipeline replacement project at fort bragg  an increase in operating income of approximately million was recorded during the second quarter of the change in estimated costs was a result of successful negotiations to reduce the cost of construction work by contractors 
in november  the government also issued a contract modification to odus for a sewer rehabilitation project at fort lee that had been completed in the prior year 
the contract modification provided for  of additional construction revenues for the year ended december  management fee revenues decreased by million for the year ended december  this is primarily due to million in management fees received in in connection with requests for equitable adjustment reas and contract modifications resolved with the us government that were retroactive 
the effect of these reas and contract modifications were partially offset by the receipt of a contract modification in connection with the first price redetermination for certain of the military bases in virginia

as approved by the cpuc  gswc has implemented a modified cost balancing account or mcba that allows recovery of supply costs due to changes in water supply mix or volume 
under the mcba  gswc began tracking adopted expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the supply cost balancing account provision 
the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to gswc s customers at a later date 
this is reflected with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each water ratemaking area 
for the year ended december   of gswc s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  as previously discussed  variances between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the supply cost balancing account provision 
the overall adopted percentages of purchased water for the years ended december  and was approximately  as compared to the actual of and  respectively 
the improvement in actual mix compared to the mix approved by the cpuc resulted in an over collection in the mcba account 
the overall water margin percent was for the year ended december  as compared to in the same period of purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million as compared to million in the increase in purchased water costs was due to higher water rates charged by wholesale suppliers  partially offset by lower customer usage 
gswc s customer water usage decreased in as compared to for the year ended december   power purchased for pumping decreased to million  compared to million for this was due to lower customer demand  partially offset by increases in supplier rates 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments were million in  as compared to million in due to additional assessment rates levied and an increase in purchasing replenishment water 
there were also changes in the actual supply mix  as discussed above 
due to the mcba account  these additional assessments do not impact the water margin 
the mcba tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
there was a million decrease in the water supply cost balancing account provision during the year ended december  as compared to due to a million decrease in the mcba as a result of higher water rates charged by wholesale suppliers  as noted above 
this decrease in the mcba was partially offset by an increase of  in the amortization of the water supply cost balancing accounts for previously under collected balances  primarily from region i 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to an increase in customer usage of 
the main product under gswc s current power purchase contract provides for megawatts of electric energy at a fixed price of per megawatt hour mwh during as compared to during through august   the difference between the price of purchased power and per mwh  the maximum recoverable amount as authorized by the cpuc  was reflected in the electric supply cost balancing account 
effective september   bves is no longer subject to the per mwh weighted annual average cost and is able to include amounts above the per mwh average in its supply cost balancing account 

table of contents other operation expenses the primary components of other operation expenses include payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and outside service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices

for the years ended december  and  other operation expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operation expenses for the year ended december   other operation expenses for water services decreased by  or  primarily due to decreases in water conservation and treatment costs  attributable to a combination of lower water consumption by our customers  wells out of service in some areas  and efficiencies in operations 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in outside service costs and in billing supplies costs to convert to monthly billing in various gswc service areas 
other operation expenses for contracted services increased by  due primarily to higher labor costs of  partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs of  the increase in labor costs was primarily due to precontract costs for design and engineering labor incurred by onus for fort bragg in north carolina and fbws for fort bliss in texas for potential new construction projects 
these expenses were incurred in connection with the preparation and submission of proposals for potential construction work
