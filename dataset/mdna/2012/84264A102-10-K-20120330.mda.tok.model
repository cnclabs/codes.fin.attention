critical accounting policy in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reporting the results of operations and financial condition in preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s only critical accounting policy  which is the policy that is most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed this critical accounting policy and estimates with its audit committee 
refer to the discussion below under allowance for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are considered impaired 
for such impaired loans  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or observable market price or collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers all other loans  segregated generally by loan type and further segregated by risk rating  and is based on historical loss experience with adjustments for qualitative factors which are made after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss data 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and real estate loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
impaired loans also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
a modified loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr when two conditions are met the borrower is experiencing documented financial difficulty and concessions are made by the company that would not otherwise be considered for a borrower with similar credit characteristics 
the most common types of modifications include interest rate reductions and or maturity extensions 
modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower  as the bank does not employ modification programs for temporary or trial periods 
all modifications are permanent 
the modified loan does not revert back to its original terms  even if the modified loan agreement is violated 
the company s workout committee continues to monitor the modified loan and if a re default occurs  the loan is classified as a re defaulted tdr and collection is pursued through liquidation of collateral  from guarantors  if any  or through other legal action 
most tdrs are placed on nonaccrual status at the time of restructuring  and continue on nonaccrual status until they have performed under the revised terms of the modified loan agreement for a minimum of six months 
in certain instances  for tdrs that are on accrual status at the time the loans are restructured  the bank may continue to classify the loans as accruing loans based upon the terms and conditions of the restructuring 
at december   the bank had two commercial loans secured by real estate classified as tdrs on nonaccrual status and one commercial loan classified as a tdr on accrual status 
tdrs are classified as impaired loans and remain as tdrs for the remaining life of the loan 
at december   all tdrs have been performing in accordance with the restructured terms 
impairment analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for all modified commercial loans  residential mortgages and consumer loans that are deemed to be tdrs  and related charge offs are recorded or specific reserves are established as appropriate 
commercial loans include loans categorized as commercial loans secured by real estate  commercial loans  and construction and land loans 
impairment is measured by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the original contractual interest rate for the loan is used as the discount rate for fixed rate loan modifications 
the current rate is used as the discount rate when the loan s interest rate floats with a specified index 
a change in terms or payments would be included in the impairment calculation 
the allowances established for losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of problem loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the borrower s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed by the credit department  in consultation with the loan officers  for all commercial loans 
specific valuation allowances are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed  collateral deficiencies  the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 
general valuation allowances are calculated based on the historical loss experience of specific types of loans 
a historical valuation allowance is established for each pool of similar loans based upon the product of the historical loss ratio and the total dollar amount of the loans in the pool 
the company s pools of similar loans include analogous risk graded groups of commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer real estate loans and consumer and other loans 
due to the relatively small asset size and loans outstanding of the company  the company uses readily available data from the fdic regarding the loss experience of national banks with assets between million and million and combines this data with the company s actual loss experience to develop average loss factors by weighting the national banks loss experience and the company s loss experience 
as both the company s asset size and outstanding loan balance increased significantly during  beginning with the quarter ended march   the company determined to place greater emphasis on the company s loss experience and to utilize the average loss experience for the prior four years instead of the prior three years used in the company s calculations through december  the company increased the weighting of its loss experience from to 
the company intends to weight the company s loss experience more heavily in determining the allowance for loan loss provision as the size of the company s loan portfolio becomes more significant 
the historical loss period was extended by an additional year from the loss period utilized through december   which is considered more representative of average annual losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  lower as a result of the combined effect of these changes 
general valuation allowances are based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors  both internal and external  to the company 
in general  such valuation allowances are determined by evaluating  among other things i the experience  ability and effectiveness of the bank s lending management and staff  ii the effectiveness of the company s loan policies  procedures and internal controls  iii changes in asset quality  iv changes in loan portfolio volume  v the composition and concentrations of credit  and vi the impact of national and local economic trends and conditions 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
each component is determined to have either a high  moderate or low degree of risk 
the results are then entered into a general allocation matrix to determine an appropriate general valuation allowance 
based upon this evaluation  management believes the allowance for loan losses of  or of gross loans outstanding at december  is adequate  under prevailing economic conditions  to absorb losses on existing loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  or of gross loans outstanding 
the decrease in the allowance at december  compared to december was attributable to a  decrease in the specific component of the allowance  which was partially offset by a  increase in the general component of the allowance 
the decrease in the specific component of the allowance was due to a decrease in specific reserves totaling  for loans charged off during that were classified as impaired at december   receipt of  in principal payments  a  increase in the amount of collateral available to the bank as a result of payments being made by the borrower on a first mortgage in a superior position to the bank for a loan that was impaired at both december  and december   and a decrease of  relating to a loan classified as impaired at december  that returned to performing status in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in specific reserves totaling  relating to an impaired loan restructured in a troubled debt restructuring during the year ended december  the increase in the general component of the reserve between december  and december  amounted to  of which  was due to changes in the reserve factors  which was partially offset by  due to a decline in loan volume 
the  increase resulting from changes in general reserve factors consisted of  attributable to changes to the qualitative factors and  which consisted of changes in the quantitative factors due to the company s increased charge off experience in the company had  in loan charge offs in  of which  was for loans that were not impaired at december    was related to loans that had specific reserves at december  and for which losses were confirmed in  and  was for loans identified as impaired at december  that the company determined to accept a lower than anticipated collateral value to ensure timely disposition of the properties 
of the  in loan charge offs in  approximately million was for commercial loans secured by real estate and million was for commercial loans  each of which were severely impacted by current economic conditions 
the  of loans charged off in that were not impaired at december  consisted primarily of one commercial loan secured by real estate and one commercial loan that began showing signs of deterioration in these loans were evaluated and confirmed to be impaired 
the commercial loan secured by real estate was severely impacted by competitive pressures and unfavorable market conditions that resulted in the borrower s business discontinuing operations in early the loan was secured by accounts receivable and commercial real estate 
the company received a listing of accounts receivable serving as collateral for the balance of the borrower s loan 
upon analysis  the company determined that the accounts receivable and commercial real estate serving as collateral for the loan were insufficient to repay the loan  resulting in a direct charge off of  after collection of approximately  in business assets securing the loan 
in addition  during the company s review of the financial statements of a borrower whose commercial loan was secured by ucc filings on business assets and real estate that had been performing under the terms and conditions of the loan  it was determined that there was a lack of demonstrable cash flows from business operations to enable the borrower to continue to meet its debt service obligations 
the company evaluated the collateral supporting the loan and determined that there was a shortfall  which resulted in a partial charge off of  the significant increase in charge offs in compared to was the result of the impact on businesses from the continued general weakness in the economy as described above  as well as increased efforts by the company to identify problem loans 
during  the company conducted  as described above  a comprehensive review of its loan portfolio to identify and adequately provide for problem loans 
the company employed the services of two independent loan review companies in late and early that have confirmed the company s assessment of its loan portfolio 
the company s net loan charge offs in exceeded its estimates of losses inherent in the portfolio at the beginning of the year 
these loan losses reflected the economic and market changes in that affected borrowers 
at december   the allowance included million in specific impaired loan reserves compared to  of such reserve at december  generally  the company recognized specific reserves for its estimate of impairment losses relating to collateral dependent impaired loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined to record any measured impairment on its impaired loans as a charge to the allowance for loan losses rather than establishing a specific reserve amount for such impaired loans  effectively eliminating the company s specific impairment reserve component of the allowance 
the company estimates that million of charge offs during relate to such impairments 
included in these charge offs were  and  in commercial loans and commercial loans secured by real estate  respectively 
in addition  while overall loan payment performance remained within the expected range throughout the year  the company undertook an initiative to aggressively identify and provide for potential problem loans 
in order to reduce the company s exposure to problem loans and potential problem loans  management took actions to reduce these exposures through loan modifications and partial or complete charge offs 
management believes this approach has identified the impairment risk in the loan portfolio and  therefore  management believes the current allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
further  management also believes that any strengthening of the economy and or improvement of the real estate markets may result in the recovery of a portion of the losses recorded on its impaired loans 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days past due unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
consumer installment loans are typically charged off no later than days past due 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
management considers all non accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans to be impaired 
in most cases  loan payments that are past due less than days and the related loans are not considered to be impaired

non interest bearing deposits were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  total interest bearing checking  money market and savings deposits increased million or to million at december  from million at december  time deposits decreased to million at december  from million at december   a million or decrease 
included in time deposits at december  and december  were million and million  respectively  in brokered deposits 
this included the company s placement of million in customer deposits at both december  and and the purchase of million and million  respectively  at december  and in brokered certificates of deposit through the cdars program 
the cdars program offers the bank both reciprocal and one way swap programs which allow customers to enjoy additional fdic insurance for deposits that might not otherwise be eligible for fdic insurance and gives the bank additional access to funding 
the bank maintains relationships with several deposit brokers and could utilize the services of one or more of these brokers if management determines that issuing brokered certificates of deposit would be in the best interest of the bank and the company 
the greater new haven market is highly competitive 
the bank faces competition from a large number of banks ranging from small community banks to large international banks  credit unions  and other providers of financial services 
the level of rates offered by the bank reflects the high level of competition in its market 
at december   the bank s maturities of time deposits were less than thousands of dollars or greater totals due within three months or less over three months to six months over six months to one year over one year to two years over two years to three years over three years other the increase in other assets of  was attributable mainly to proceeds due to the bank for net settlement proceeds on the foreclosure sale of the real estate collateral securing the bank s participation in a commercial loan 
results of operations the company s net loss for fiscal year was  or basic and diluted loss per share of  compared to a net loss of  or basic and diluted loss per share of in fiscal year the company s net losses for the years ended december  and were largely attributable to provisions for loan losses of  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses during when compared to was primarily related to commercial loans secured by real estate and construction and land loans that were severely impacted by prevailing economic conditions  as well as net increases in the general reserve allowances on performing loans resulting primarily from the company s increased loan charge off experience and changes to qualitative factors considered in determining the general reserve discussed in more detail under allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the impact of the increase in the provision for loan losses  the company s operating results for the year ended december   when compared to the same period of  were influenced by the following factors net interest income decreased due to the combined effects of lower yields on interest earning assets primarily attributable to a decline in yields in the loan portfolio  decreases in loan volume  and increases in liability volumes  which were partially offset by lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  noninterest income decreased primarily because of lower rental income and decreases in service charges and fees resulting from changes in the business practices of customers of the bank  which was partially offset by recognition of a gain on a derivative financial instrument during  and noninterest expenses increased during compared to due to an increase in other operating expenses  which was partially offset by lower salaries and benefits expense as well as a decline in the cost of fdic insurance 
the increase in other operating expenses for when compared to was primarily related to an increase in foreclosed and repossessed asset expenses and write downs  loan related collection expenses including legal and appraisal fees  and increases in directors fees 
the decrease in salaries and benefits expense during when compared to was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels for scb capital  inc and expense savings attributable to the departure of the former president of the company and the bank in april and open staff positions at the bank 
these cost savings were partially offset by the salary and expenses attributable to the hiring of a chief executive officer in october  fdic insurance expense decreased during when compared to primarily due to the fdic changing the deposit insurance assessment base from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity effective april  and due to the fdic decreasing the deposit insurance assessment rates 
net interest income the principal source of revenue for the bank is net interest income 
the bank s net interest income is dependent primarily upon the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans receivable and securities and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the bank  like other banking institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times  or on a different basis  than its interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   net interest income was  versus  for the same period in the  or decrease was the result of a  decrease in interest income which was partially offset by a  decrease in interest expense 
this net decrease was primarily the result of decreased asset volumes  lower yields on interest earning assets and increases in average balances on interest bearing liabilities  which were partially offset by lower rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average total interest earning assets were million for the period ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in average interest earning assets of million during the year ended december  was comprised of decreases in average balances of loans of million  as well as decreases in average balances of short term and other investments of million and investments of  the yield on average interest earning assets for the period ended december  was compared to for the same period in  a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets was primarily attributable to lower yields on the bank s loan portfolio because of the lower interest rate environment 
the combined effects of the million decrease in average balances of interest earning assets and the basis point decrease in yield on average interest earning assets resulted in the  decrease in interest income for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the average balance of the company s interest bearing liabilities was million for the period ended december  compared to million for the period ended december   an increase of million or 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for the period ended december  compared to for the same period in  which was primarily due to a general decrease in market interest rates

variances in the cost of interest bearing liabilities during the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in were due to decreased rate considerations of  which were partially offset by increased volume considerations of the company intends for the bank to continue to emphasize lending to small to medium sized businesses in its market area as it maintains its strategy to increase assets under management and to improve earnings 
the bank will seek opportunities through marketing to increase its deposit base  with a primary objective of attracting core non interest checking and related money market deposit accounts  in order to support its earning assets and through the consideration of additional branch locations and new product and service offerings

noninterest income total noninterest income decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decline in noninterest income for the year ended december  was due to a  decline in service charges and fees due to changes in business practices of customers of the bank during and by a  gain on the sale of an available for sale security during with no similar gain recognized in  which was partially offset by recognition of an  gain on a derivative financial instrument 
other noninterest income decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  in the same period in  primarily due to a  decrease in rental income 
noninterest expenses total noninterest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
salaries and benefits expense declined  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels for scb capital  inc  expense savings attributable to the departure of the former president of the company and the bank in april and open staff positions at the bank

the liquidity ratio is defined as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets 
the following categories of assets as described in the accompanying balance sheet are considered liquid assets cash and due from banks  short term investments  interest bearing certificates of deposit and securities available for sale 
liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover downward fluctuations in deposits and increases in its loan portfolio 
management believes the company s short term assets provide sufficient liquidity to cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and loan demand and to meet other anticipated operating cash and investment requirements 
capital the following table illustrates the company s and bank s regulatory capital ratios at december  and company bank capital capital adequacy adequacy target ratio target ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage capital ratio to average assets capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
to be considered well capitalized  an institution must generally have a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
based on the above ratios  the bank is considered to be well capitalized under applicable regulations 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least as of december   the bank s tier i leverage ratio  tier i risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratios were above such minimums

market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
based upon the nature of the company s business  market risk is primarily limited to interest rate risk  which is defined as the impact of changing interest rates on current and future earnings 
the company s goal is to maximize long term profitability  while minimizing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the first priority is to structure and price the company s assets and liabilities to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread  while reducing the net effect of changes in interest rates 
in order to reach an acceptable interest rate spread  the company must generate loans and seek acceptable long term investments to replace the lower yielding balances in federal funds sold and short term investments 
the focus also must be on maintaining a proper balance between the timing and volume of assets and liabilities re pricing within the balance sheet 
one method of achieving this balance is to originate variable loans for the portfolio to offset the short term re pricing of the liabilities 
in fact  a number of the interest bearing deposit products have no contractual maturity 
customers may withdraw funds from their accounts at any time and deposits balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changing market conditions 
the exposure to interest rate risk is monitored by senior management of the bank and reported quarterly to the asset and liability management committee and the board of directors 
management reviews the interrelationships within the balance sheet to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this fact  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular  real estate 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods
