the remaining rate increase was due to a combination of reduced foreign tax credits  elimination of the r d tax credit and additional impact of the valuation allowance related to the company s belgian facility 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  slightly higher than the prior year rate of percent 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during fiscal  the company continued to incur operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited 
the company has evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions and concluded that based primarily upon continuing losses in these jurisdictions and failure to achieve targeted levels of improvement  a full valuation allowance continues to be necessary 
therefore  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of million 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income and foreign source income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets

not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results

cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method 
table of contents for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory

goodwill in conformity with us gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might exist 
the company performs impairment reviews for its four reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
based upon the goodwill impairment review completed at the end of fiscal  it was determined that the goodwill for one of the company s reporting units was fully impaired 
the fair value for each of the remaining reporting units at june  significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
see note d for additional discussion of the fiscal impairment charge 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units  management is required to make estimates of future operating results  including growth rates  and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  among others 
our development of future operating results incorporate management s best estimates of current and future economic and market conditions which are derived from a review of past results  current results and approved business plans 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions  economic factors and or market indicators could materially change the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units and  therefore  impairment charges could be required in the future 
the following assumptions are key to our discounted cash flow model  business projections we make assumptions about the level of sales for each fiscal year including expected growth  if any 
this assumption drives our planning for volumes  mix  and pricing 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  cost performance  etc these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans that are reviewed annually during the annual budget process  discount rates when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality tables  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve at june  as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans 
this yield curve is made up of corporate bonds rated aa or better 
expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase reflect the long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates based upon the generational mortality table for fiscal  and health care cost trend rates developed based upon historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods

the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset
