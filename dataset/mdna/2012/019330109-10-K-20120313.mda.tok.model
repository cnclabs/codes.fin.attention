item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview of for the year  we achieved record sales  record orders  record profits  record cash flow and we ended the year with a record backlog 
sales to our medical  vehicle  industrial and electronics markets were up in while aerospace and defense was flat 
in  orders were million  up from million in year ended backlog was million compared to million at the end of net income and earnings per share for were record highs  as we continued to place a lot of emphasis on providing more value added motion control solutions to our customers and we continued to market our electronic motion control capabilities 
from a cash flow perspective  we improved our cash net of debt position by million 
we began with cash net of debt of million and ended the year with million in cash net of debt 
we also instituted a quarterly dividend program in the third quarter of  and in we announced a increase in our dividends per share to 
per share in a recent press release 
our strategy as this record year was coming to a close  we felt it was important to capitalize on our positive momentum and to update the long term strategy for allied motion 
in december  we brought our global team together and focused on a one company one team approach to update and create the strategic plan for the next three to five years 
reviewing the aggressive goals and objectives established by our team  we believe it clearly indicates that our team is ready and willing to take allied motion to higher levels in the future 
our global team updated our long term strategy and established new long term goals and objectives and developed the critical issue plan to achieve these goals 
the execution of this plan will further establish allied motion as a leader in its selected target market segments 
our strong financial condition  combined with allied systematic tools ast to continuously improve quality  delivery  cost and focus on the creation of innovative motion solutions that change the game and create value for our customers  allow us to have a positive outlook for the continued long term growth of our company 
outlook for for  we ve built our plans with the expectation that europe would exhibit minimal growth  north america modest growth and asia would have the highest levels of growth 
we also feel that china will continue to lead world wide growth although we expect their costs will continue to rise relatively quickly 
therefore  these factors lead us to a strategy that builds upon our proven technical expertise and treats the region as an important growth market and not just a low cost labor source in the future 

table of contents we expect that internal cash flow from our operations will continue to fund our growth opportunities  both internal and external  and our dividend program will continue 
we are confident that our cash flows can support our growth initiatives and also reward our shareholders at the same time 
we will emphasize gross margin improvement 
gross margin improvement requires cost reduction  new products emphasizing more complete motion control systems and a support structure trained to sell  apply and service our products and customers 
we made good progress in and these initiatives will continue in electronic motion control brought new growth opportunities and added value in several new applications in and we expect more of the same in we made two acquisitions in that brought more electronic motion control capabilities and we will continue to invest aggressively in this area 
our one team sales force developed nicely in north america and europe  and we will begin establishing the same capability in asia 
our solution centers differentiate us from our competition and will become functional in north america and europe and the foundation will be established in asia in together with our one team sales force  the solution center is the glue that allows us to function and act as one company  a common request from our customers 
our platform based product line approach whereby we preplan what products are required by our served market segments  provides us the capability to quickly deliver prototypes  be first in with application solutions and secure new design in wins 
while it is relatively simple to achieve this on an independent component level basis  a coordinated effort to tie all of our technologies together as systems is where the real opportunity lies and that will be our emphasis 
further development and promotion of our parent brand  allied motion  will continue in a global structure has been defined and we will use that to our advantage in the marketplace 
we also plan to take our commitment to ast to a new level in as we invest in additional resources as part of our operational excellence team to continuously build and utilize ast to improve efficiencies and eliminate waste throughout our company 
we believe the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability
