item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company during the past three years 
the discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
reclassification in certain circumstances  reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the presentation 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies followed by the company conform with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and they conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s critical accounting policies  which are summarized below  relate to the allowance for loan losses  acquired loans with specific credit related deterioration and goodwill impairment 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial information contained within the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting fasb topic contingencies recognition which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and fasb topic receivables overall subsequent measurement which requires that losses on impaired loans be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows  or values observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each component is determined based upon estimates 
with regard to commercial loans  the formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses  along with various qualitative factors  including levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in underwriting standards  experience of lending staff  economic conditions  and portfolio concentrations 
in the formula allowance  the migrated historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors  resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk grade category of loans 
with regard to consumer loans  the allowance calculations are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade 
this loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category 
the period end balances for each loan risk grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor 
the formula allowance is calculated for a range of outcomes 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans 
the use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is an estimate of the losses inherent in off balance sheet loan commitments at the balance sheet date 
it is calculated by multiplying an estimated loss factor by an estimated probability of funding  and then by the period end amounts for unfunded commitments 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included in other liabilities 
acquired loans with specific credit related deterioration acquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by the company in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification certain acquired loans  those for which specific credit related deterioration  since origination  is identified  are recorded at fair value reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected 
income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected 
acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent  with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate  remain on non accrual status and have no accretable yield 

cross reference index goodwill impairment the company tests goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may have been impairment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
the goodwill impairment test requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
the goodwill impairment testing conducted by the company in indicated that goodwill is not impaired and is properly recorded in the financial statements 
non gaap presentations the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets

acquisition of midcarolina financial corporation on july   the company completed its merger with midcarolina financial corporation pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  dated december   between the company and midcarolina 
midcarolina was headquartered in burlington  north carolina  and engaged in banking operations through its subsidiary bank  midcarolina bank 
the transaction has significantly expanded the company s footprint in north carolina  adding eight branches in alamance and guilford counties 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement with midcarolina  as a result of the merger  the holders of shares of midcarolina common stock received shares of the company s common stock for each share of midcarolina common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger 
each share of company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger has continued to be outstanding after the merger 
each option to purchase a share of midcarolina common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger was converted into an option to purchase shares of company common stock  adjusted for the exchange ratio 
additionally  the holders of shares of noncumulative perpetual series a preferred stock of midcarolina received one share of a newly authorized noncumulative perpetual series a preferred stock of the company for each midcarolina preferred share held immediately before the merger 
the company s series a preferred stock was issued with terms  preferences  rights and limitations that are identical in all material respects to the midcarolina series a preferred stock the company issued  shares of additional common stock in connection with the midcarolina merger 
this represents of the now outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with the transaction  midcarolina bank was merged with and into the bank 
the acquisition has been accretive to earnings 
most of the material changes in balance sheet and income statement categories during this reporting period are directly related to the impact of the midcarolina merger 

cross reference index management information system changes coincidentally with the merger with midcarolina  the company converted its management information systems from an in house data processing system to an outsourced processing strategy 
both banks management information systems were fully integrated and converted to jack henry associates silverlake processing system in mid february results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets  such as certain state and municipal securities 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on tax exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin 
the net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
all references in this section relate to average yields and rates and average asset and liability balances during the periods discussed 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased  or in from  following a  or increase in from the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to the july merger with midcarolina 
yields on loans were in compared to in  driven primarily by  in loan accretion income recorded in second half of loan yields were also positively impacted by generally higher contractual yields in the midcarolina portfolio 
liabilities were mostly lower in compared to  especially with respect to time deposits  which were for compared to for deposit rates for demand account increased to in from in as a result of the merger and the impact of midcarolina pricing on their existing transaction accounts 
the net interest margin was for  for  and for during  the federal open market committee of the frb reduced the federal funds rate seven times from to  where it has remained for  and this historically low rate environment has had a significant effect on the company s net interest margin 
based on recent frb pronouncements  rates are expected to remain at or near historical lows through net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased  or in from the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to a reduction in interest rates paid on deposits which was partially offset by decrease in the yield on loans and a higher volume of securities 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily due to a reduction in interest rates paid on deposits 
the following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates  on a taxable equivalent basis  for the last three years 
nonaccrual loans are included in average balances 
interest income on nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status

noninterest income also includes net gains or losses on sales  calls  or impairment of investment securities and net gains or losses related to foreclosed real estate 
unless otherwise noted  most of material changes between and for noninterest income and noninterest expense relate to the july merger with midcarolina 
compared to noninterest income was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
fees from the management of trusts  estates  and asset management accounts were  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
a substantial portion of trust fees are earned based on account market values  so changes in the equity markets may have a large and potentially volatile impact on revenue 
service charges on deposit accounts were  in compared to  in  a  or increase 

cross reference index other fees and commissions were  in compared to  in  a  or increase  due primarily to increases in visa check card income 
mortgage banking income was  in compared to  in  a  or decline 
while revenue was impacted with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in september and the overall continuing slowdown in the real estate market  historically low mortgage rates have fueled continuing  but subdued  demand for refinanced mortgages from credit qualified borrowers 
securities losses were  in compared to gains of  in net gains in the period related to the sale of several relatively small dollar odd lot size balances of mortgage backed securities 
other noninterest income was  in compared to  in  a  or decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to the sale of bank owned property that had been held for future expansion 
the transaction generated a net gain on sale of  for compared to noninterest income was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
fees from the management of trusts  estates  and asset management accounts were  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
service charges on deposit accounts were  in compared to  in  an  or decrease 
the reduction was primarily the result of lower non sufficient funds and overdraft fee volume 
other fees and commissions were  in compared to  in  a  or increase  due primarily to increases in visa check card income 
however  management expects this income category will decline substantially after implementation of certain provisions of the recent dodd frank act banking reform legislation  which is expected to have a negative impact on electronic banking fee income for the industry 
mortgage banking income was  in compared to  in  a  or decline 
securities gains were  in compared to  in this increase was related to the sale of sixteen mortgage backed pass through securities totaling  and seven new jersey municipal bonds totaling  the mortgage pass through sale was an effort to remove relatively low balance bonds with uncertain  multi year cash flow characteristics 
the new jersey bond sale was a result of management s action to concern about the ability of local voters in that state to restrict tax levies and the possible impact on bond holders of such restrictions 
net losses on foreclosed real estate were  in compared to  in  an  or improvement 
approximately  of the amount was associated with real estate write downs on one commercial real estate acquisition and development loan in north carolina 
other noninterest income was  in compared to  in  a  or increase 
noninterest expense unless otherwise noted  most of material changes between and for noninterest income and noninterest expense relate to the july merger with midcarolina 
compared to noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
salaries were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
employee benefits were  in compared to  an increase of  or 

cross reference index occupancy and equipment expense were  for compared to  for  an increase of  or 
fdic insurance assessment was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
merger related expenses associated with the acquisition of midcarolina totaled  there were no comparable expenses in management does not expect this expense category to be material in other noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
compared to noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
salaries were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
decreases in salaries and commission expense basically offset increases in incentive compensation 
employee benefits were  in compared to  a decrease of  or 
this was due primarily to the change in the company s defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan  which was effective december   which reduced pension costs by  occupancy and equipment expense were  for  compared to  for  virtually unchanged 
fdic insurance assessment was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is directly related to a second quarter special fdic insurance assessment of  there was no special assessment levied in other noninterest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily due to  in expenses related to the merger with midcarolina financial corporation 
income taxes income taxes on earnings amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to in and in the company was subject to a statutory  blended  federal tax rate of in  and the major difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes 
the primary non taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and industrial revenue bonds or loans 

cross reference index fair value impact to net income the following table presents the actual effect for the year ended december  of the accretable and amortizable fair value adjustments attributable to the midcarolina merger on july  on net interest income and pretax income 
in thousands income statement effect premium discount balance on july  for the year ended december  interest income expense loans income accretable portion of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality income time deposits income time deposits brokered income time deposits cdars income fhlb advances expense trust preferred securities expense net interest income non interest expense amortization of core deposit intangible expense net non interest expense change in pretax income impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
the most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation 
changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management practices  the company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk 
market risk management effectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the company s financial objectives 
market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  however  market risk also includes liquidity risk 
both are discussed below 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its asset liability investment committee alco and board of directors  both of which receive and review periodic reports of the company s interest rate risk position 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates 
simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates and maturities of assets and liabilities 
it incorporates numerous assumptions including growth  changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  prepayments  and average rates earned and paid 
based on this information  management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios 
a balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets loans and securities reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities deposits and borrowings 
an asset sensitive balance sheet will produce more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline 
based on the company s simulation analysis  management believes the company s interest sensitivity position at december  is asset sensitive 
management has no expectation that market rates will decline in the near term  given the prevailing economy 

cross reference index the interest rate sensitivity position at december  is illustrated in the following table 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are presented in the periods they are expected to reprice or mature 
table interest rate sensitivity gap analysis december  dollars in thousands within year year year to years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits with other banks securities loans total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities checking and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits customer repurchase agreements federal home loan bank advances trust preferred capital notes total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets loans include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income 

cross reference index table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of december   assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates  and consistent levels of assets and liabilities 
net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates 
due to the current low interest rate environment  no measurement was considered necessary for a further decline in interest rates 
table estimated changes in net interest income dollars in thousands december  change in changes in interest net interest income rates amount percent up up up up no change represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the new interest rate environment and the current interest rate environment 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income 
computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain limitations are inherent in such computations 
assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates 
interest rate shifts may not be parallel 
changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  which may in turn affect the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
additionally  credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt 
liquidity risk management liquidity is the ability of the company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs or depositors desiring to withdraw funds 
additionally  the company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  the servicing of debt  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by the alco and board of directors  both of which receive periodic reports of the company s interest rate risk position 
the company uses a simulation and budget model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the company 
liquidity sources include cash and amounts due from banks  deposits in other banks  loan repayments  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  federal funds lines of credit from two correspondent banks  access to the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window  and maturities and sales of securities 
management believes that these sources provide sufficient and timely liquidity 
the company has a line of credit with the fhlb  equal to of the company s assets  subject to the amount of collateral pledged 
under the terms of its collateral agreement with the fhlb  the company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans 
in addition  the company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the fhlb 
at december   principal advance obligations to the fhlb consisted of  in fixed rate  long term advances and  in short term advances compared to  in long term advances and  in short term advances at december  the company also had outstanding  in letters of credit at december  and  in letters of credit at december  the letters of credit provide the bank with alternate collateral for securing public entity deposits above fdic insurance levels  thereby providing less need for collateral pledging from the securities portfolio 

cross reference index the company had fixed rate term advance borrowing contracts with the fhlb as of december   with the following final maturities amount maturity date march november the fixed rate term advance due november is net of a fair value adjustment of  the company has federal funds lines of credit established with three correspondent banks in the amounts of   and  and has access to the federal reserve bank s discount window 
there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at december  as a result of the merger with midcarolina  the company acquired a relationship with promontory network  the sponsoring entity for the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
through cdars  the company is able to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate fdic insurance in amounts far exceeding  this gives the company the ability  as and when needed  to attract and retain large deposits from insurance and other safety conscious customers 
cdars are classified as brokered deposits  however they are generally derived from customers with whom our institution has or wishes to have a direct and ongoing relationship 
as a result  management considers these deposits functionally in the same category as core deposits 
with cdars  the company has the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network 
additionally  subject to certain limits  the bank can use cdars purchase cost effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered cds or the fhlb 
in this manner  cdars can provide the company with another funding option 
thus  cdars serves as a deposit gathering tool and liquidity management tool 
balance sheet analysis securities the securities portfolio generates income  plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity  provides a source of liquidity  and is used to meet collateral requirements 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of high quality investments 
federal agency  mortgage backed  and state and municipal securities comprise the majority of the portfolio 
the continuing economic challenges on a local  regional and national level have resulted in a significant slowdown in business activity throughout and continuing into the company is cognizant of the historically low interest rate environment and has elected to maintain a defensive asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities of relatively short duration and longer term tax exempt securities  whose market values are not as volatile in rising rate environments as similar termed taxable investments

in anticipation of a significant increase in the size and complexity of the loan portfolio  the company reviewed  reorganized  and augmented its lending and credit functions significantly 
most notably  the company created the positions of senior credit officer for virginia and senior credit officer for north carolina  both of whom report to the company s chief credit officer 
both regions have active asset quality committees 
initial lending authorities in the north carolina region are more conservative than those in the virginia region 
the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and residential real estate loans  commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses  construction and land development loans  and home equity loans 
average loans increased  or from to  primarily driven by the july merger with midcarolina 
average loans decreased  or from to  driven primarily by the overall deleveraging in the marketplace

allowance for loan losses the purpose of the allowance for loan losses is to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged off loans 
loan charge offs decrease the allowance 
the company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk 
these practices include a appropriate lending limits for loan officers  b a loan approval process  c careful underwriting of loan requests  including analysis of borrowers  collateral  and market risks  d regular monitoring of the portfolio  including diversification by type and geography  e review of loans by the loan review department  which operates independently of loan production  f regular meetings of the credit committees to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests  and g regular meetings of the asset quality committee which reviews the status of individual loans 
risk grades are assigned as part of the origination process 
from time to time risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit 
calculations of the allowance for loan losses are prepared quarterly by the loan review department 
the company s credit committee  audit committee  and the board of directors review the allowance for adequacy 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  factors which are considered include  but are not limited to  historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  loan risk ratings  nonperforming loans  impaired loans  other problem credits  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and national  regional and local economic conditions and trends 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates 
the formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses  along with various qualitative factors  including levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in underwriting standards  experience of lending staff  economic conditions  and portfolio concentrations 
in the formula allowance  the migrated historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors  resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk grade category of loans 
allowance calculations for consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade 
this loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category 
the period end balances for each loan risk grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor 
the formula allowance is calculated for a range of outcomes 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans 
the use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
no single statistic  formula  or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance 
management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for analytical purposes  management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans 
however  the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  including identified and unidentified losses 

cross reference index the relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance  including the qualitative factors  may change from period to period 
furthermore  management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the company will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved 
management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance  considering current factors at the time  including economic conditions  industry trends  and ongoing internal and external examination processes 
the allowance is also subject to regular regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks 
for the years ended december    and  the allowance for loan losses was   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans at each of those dates was   and  respectively 
the significant decline in the allowance is related to the merger with midcarolina 
in that transaction  approximately million in loans were added to the balance sheet  at fair value and  in conformity with current generally accepted accounting principles  without a related allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans  net of fair value loans  at year end was 
the provision for loan losses for the same years was   and  respectively 
the increased provision expense for was in recognition of the larger size and complexity of the bank s loan portfolio after the merger and the rapid accretion of the credit mark associated with the fair value loans acquired in the merger

nonperforming loans to total loans were at december  compared to at december  the increase was primarily the result of the merger with midcarolina 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets at december   compared to at december  there were  in troubled debt restructurings at december  compared to at december  in most cases it is the policy of the company that any loan that becomes days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status  accrued interest reversed out of income  and further interest accrual ceased 
any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal 
in some cases a loan in process of renewal may become days past due 
in these instances the loan may still be accruing because of a delayed renewal process in which the customer has not been billed 
loans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than days delinquent
