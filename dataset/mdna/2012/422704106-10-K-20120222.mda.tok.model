item a 
risk factors the following risks and uncertainties  together with the other information set forth in this form k  should be carefully considered by those who invest in our securities 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results and could decrease the value of our common and or preferred stock 
financial risks global financial events may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system had an impact on our business and financial position  and a similar financial event in the future may also impact us 
the continuation or re emergence of the financial crisis may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets 
as discussed further below  the prices of the metals that we produce are affected by a number of factors  and it is unknown how these factors may be impacted by a global financial event 
we have had losses that could reoccur in the future 
although we reported net income for the years ended december    and of million  million  million and million  respectively  we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
a comparison of operating results over the past three years can be found in results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  the volatility of metals prices  smelter terms  rock and soil conditions  seismic events  diesel fuel prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  availability and cost of labor  economic developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  ore grades  recoveries  and speculation  purchases and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future 
commodity risk management activities could expose us to losses 
we periodically enter into risk management activities  such as financially settled forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the prices received on the metals we produce 
such activities are utilized to attempt to insulate our operating results from changes in prices for those metals 
however  such activities may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity 
we utilize financially settled forward contract programs to manage the exposure to changes in lead and zinc prices contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement  and to manage the exposure of changes in the prices of lead and zinc contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these base metals forward contract programs 
the financial terms of settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and other claims may materially impact our cash resources and our access to additional financing 
on september   a consent decree the consent decree settling environmental litigation and related claims involving hecla limited pertaining to historic releases of mining wastes in the coeur d alene basin was approved and entered by the us district court in idaho 
the consent decree resolved all existing claims of the united states  the coeur d alene indian tribe  and the state of idaho plaintiffs against hecla limited and its affiliates under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla and certain other statutes for past response costs  future environmental remediation costs  and natural resource damages related to historic releases of mining wastes in the coeur d alene river basin  as well as all remaining obligations of hecla limited with respect to the bunker hill superfund site 
in addition to the approximately million already paid under the consent decree in  hecla limited remains obligated under the consent decree to make the following payments million of cash by october   million of cash by october   and approximately million by august  as quarterly payments of the proceeds from the exercise of any outstanding series and series warrants which have an exercise price of between and per share during the quarter  with the remaining balance  if any  due in august if additional warrants are not exercised  the requirement to pay up to million excluding interest in cash over the next approximately three years will cause us to use a significant portion of either our cash currently on hand  or future cash resources 
our cash on hand at december  was million  however  there can be no assurance that we will have the cash on hand to meet these obligations 
financial terms of settlement also require that hecla mining company or hecla limited post third party surety in some form to secure the remaining payments 
obtaining surety causes us to incur costs  and also to utilize credit capacity which could otherwise be used to fund other areas of our business  including operations and capital expenditures 
moreover  there is no guarantee that we will be able maintain such surety  in which case we could be in default of the consent decree  which could have a material adverse effect on hecla limited s or our results from operations or financial position 
more information about the terms of settlement is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities and services 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities and services such as fuel  steel  cement and electricity 
the recent prices for such commodities have been volatile and may increase our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves and other mineralized material that are the basis for future income and cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  reserves for contingencies and litigation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise  our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made  and we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  including speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  political instability  inflation  recession or increased or reduced economic activity  and other political  regulatory and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties 
the following table sets forth the average daily closing prices of the following metals for the year ended december  and each year thereafter through silver per oz 
gold per oz 
lead per lb 
zinc per lb 
london fix london final london metals exchange cash london metals exchange special high grade cash on february   the closing prices for silver  gold  lead and zinc were per ounce   per ounce  per pound and per pound  respectively 
an extended decline in metals prices  an increase in operating or capital costs  or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves may cause us to record write downs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we review the recoverability of the carrying value by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairment must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows  and recognizing impairment write downs could negatively impact our results of operations 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the analysis of the carrying values of our assets  as the evaluation approach involves comparing carrying values to the average estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from operating plans using various metals price scenarios 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows for our long lived assets also include an estimate of the market value of the exploration potential beyond the current operating plans 
there were no events or changes in circumstances that caused us to evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets as of december  however  if the prices of silver  gold  zinc and lead decline for an extended period of time  if we fail to control production costs  or if we do not realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties  we may be required to evaluate the carrying values of out long lived assets and recognize asset write downs in the future 
in addition  the perceived market value of the exploration potential of our properties is dependent upon prevailing metals prices as well as our ability to discover economic ore 
a decline in metals prices for an extended period of time or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves could significantly reduce our estimations of the value of the exploration potential at our properties and result in asset write downs 
our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income we recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets reducing the value of such assets 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of a decline in metals prices or other factors  our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted 
additionally  significant future issuances of common stock or common stock equivalents could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
future changes in tax law or changes in ownership structure could limit our ability to utilize our recorded tax assets 
as of december   we removed substantially all deferred tax valuation allowances  with the exception of certain amounts related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and our current and non current deferred tax asset balances were million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets 
returns for investments in pension plans and pension plan funding requirements are uncertain we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees  which provide for specified payments after retirement for most employees 
the ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans 
returns  if any  on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions 
a sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension plans 
operation  development  exploration and acquisition risks mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  lower than expected ore grades  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore that are less economic than anticipated  or because our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 
for example  in the second quarter of  mining activities at the lucky friday mine stopped for approximately two weeks due to some deterioration of shaft infrastructure at the shaft  which is the mine s secondary escape way 
upon completion of repairs to shaft  the mine returned to normal production 
in april  a fatal accident occurred at the lucky friday mine resulting in a cessation of operations at the mine for approximately days 
in november  an accident occurred as part of the construction of the shaft at the lucky friday mine  resulting in the fatality of one contractor employee 
in an unrelated incident  in december  a rock burst occurred in a primary access way at the lucky friday mine and injured seven employees  with no fatalities as a result of that incident 
each of these events temporarily suspended operations at the lucky friday mine and adversely impacted production 
other closures or impacts on operations or production may occur at any of our mines at any time  whether related to accidents  changes in conditions  changes to regulatory policy  or as precautionary measures 
at the end of  msha began a special impact inspection at the lucky friday mine which resulted in an order closing down the silver shaft  the primary access way from surface at the lucky friday mine  until we remove loose material from the silver shaft 
this occurred despite the fact that the silver shaft was not involved in any of the accidents at the mine in underground access will be limited as this work is being performed  and we anticipate that production at the lucky friday will be suspended until early as a result 
we anticipate returning to full production levels at the lucky friday once the silver shaft work and work related to bypassing the december rock burst is complete  however  no assurance can be made as to when this will occur or as to the cost of the material removal and related work 
for further information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent accidents and other events at our lucky friday mine could have additional adverse consequences to us 
hecla limited may face enforcement actions  as well as additional orders from msha  as a result of msha s inspections and investigations of events at our lucky friday mine including the april fatal ground fall accident  the rock burst incident in december  and the order closing the silver shaft for the removal of loose material 
hecla limited could also face penalties including monetary penalties from msha or other governmental agencies relating to these incidents and any other orders or citations received by hecla limited 
in addition  msha periodically notifies certain mines that a potential pattern of violations ppov may exist based upon an initial statistical screening of violation history and pattern criteria review by msha 
receipt of notice of a ppov typically triggers an undertaking by a mine to implement corrective actions  and if certain criteria are not met  msha could subsequently issue a notice of pattern of violations npov 
receipt of a npov would  among other things  impose certain onerous conditions on the mine  including the requirement to pass an inspection in which no significant and substantial violations of a mandatory health or safety standard are found before termination of the npov 
in light of the citations orders received in and  it is possible that the lucky friday mine could receive a ppov 
finally  it is possible that hecla limited could face litigation relating to the incidents at the lucky friday mine 
we may not resolve these claims favorably  and each one of the foregoing possibilities could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is capital intensive  requiring ongoing capital investment for the replacement  modernization or expansion of equipment and facility 
our mining and milling operations are subject to risks of process upsets and equipment malfunctions 
equipment and supplies may from time to time be unavailable on a timely basis 
our business is subject to a number of other risks and hazards including environmental hazards  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  rock bursts and ground falls  seismic activity  underground fires or floods  explosive rock failures  unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  and our operating mines have tailing ponds which could fail or leak as a result of seismic activity or for other reasons 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  legal liability  and temporary or permanent closure of facilities 
we maintain insurance to protect against losses that may result from some of these risks  such as property loss and business interruption  in amounts we believe to be reasonably consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
such insurance  however  contains exclusions and limitations on coverage  particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk 
there can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and we therefore do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may have an adverse effect on our business 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may be higher and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate 
if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of metals production partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  facility and equipment costs  availability of adequate manpower  availability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture  applicable tax rates  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual operating and capital costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates  and  as such  it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  write downs of asset values  and mine closure 
efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful or could result in significant demands on our liquidity  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines are depleting assets 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves by locating and developing additional ore 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration programs 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often non productive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production from that deposit is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
to increase production and mine life at the lucky friday mine  in we continued progress on the shaft project 
we commenced engineering and construction activities on shaft in late  and our board of directors gave its final approval of the project in august work on the project thus far has included detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  hoist installation  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  feet of vertical shaft excavation  and other construction activities 
the shaft project  as currently designed  is expected to involve development down to the foot level and capital expenditures of approximately million  which includes approximately million that has been spent on the project as of december  at the end of  msha began a special impact inspection at the lucky friday mine  and as a result msha ordered the silver shaft to be closed until we remove loose material from the shaft 
the silver shaft is the primary access way from the surface at the lucky friday  and the order has resulted in a temporary suspension of most operations at the lucky friday  including work on shaft 
when access to the shaft project is restored  we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to proceed 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect completion of the project  including i a significant decline in metals prices  ii a reduction in available cash or credit  whether arising from decreased cash flow or other uses of available cash  or iii a significant increase in operating or capital costs 
an increase in the capital cost could potentially require us to suspend the project or access additional capital through debt financing  the sale of securities  or other external sources 
this additional financing could be costly or unavailable 
our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into joint venture arrangements in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
we make investments in exploration and development projects that may have to be written off in the event we do not proceed to a commercially viable mining operation 
on february   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  rio grande silver inc rgs  acquired the right to earn into a joint venture interest in an approximately square mile consolidated land package in the creede mining district of colorado 
rgs earned into the interest in in december  rgs completed the acquisition of the remaining interest of the original joint venture  while maintaining a interest in a new joint venture holding additional exploration property within the creede district  for shares of hecla common stock valued at approximately million on the date that the transaction was completed 
for more information on the terms of the agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to market our metals production may be affected by disruptions or closures of custom smelters and or refining facilities 
we sell substantially all of our metallic concentrates to custom smelters 
our dor bars are sent to refiners for further processing before being sold to metal traders 
if our ability to sell concentrates to our contracted smelters becomes unavailable to us  it is possible our operations could be adversely affected 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the distribution of our sales and our significant customers 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our shareholders  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  failure to achieve anticipated synergies  an inability to obtain financing  and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for companies and properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive companies and mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
our business depends on finding skilled miners and maintaining good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable of the mining business 
from time to time  we have encountered  and may in the future encounter  difficulty recruiting skilled mining personnel at acceptable wage and benefit levels in a competitive labor market 
temporary or extended lay offs due to mine closures may exacerbate such issues and result in vacancies or the need to hire less skilled or efficient employees 
the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
the lucky friday mine is our only operation subject to a collective bargaining agreement  which expires on april  we were recently ordered by msha to remove loose material from the silver shaft  the primary access way from surface at the lucky friday mine 
as this rehabilitation work is performed  underground access at the lucky friday mine will be limited  temporarily suspending production and underground work there 
as a result  hecla limited laid off employees  or approximately of the workforce at the lucky friday mine 
as the silver shaft work is completed  we anticipate that employment levels at the lucky friday mine will return to where they were at prior to the suspension of production 
although we believe that we will be able to successfully reassemble the workforce at the lucky friday as underground work and production resumes  competition from other companies and other factors may make recruitment difficult 
competition from other mining companies may harm our business 
we compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives  skilled labor  contractors and other employees 
we compete with other mining companies for the services of skilled personnel and contractors and their specialized equipment  components and supplies  such as drill rigs  necessary for exploration and development 
we also compete with other mining companies for rights to mine properties 
we may be unable to continue to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies  or to acquire additional rights to mine properties 
we may be subject to a number of unanticipated risks related to inadequate infrastructure 
mining  processing  development and exploration activities depend on adequate infrastructure 
reliable roads  bridges  power sources and water supply are important determinants  which affect capital and operating costs 
unusual or infrequent weather phenomena  sabotage  government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our mining operations 
our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks 
we currently conduct exploration and pre development projects in mexico and continue to own assets  real estate and mineral interests there 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct operations in mexico and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export restrictions  expropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved  including a putative class action lawsuit recently filed against us  and additional actions may be filed against us 
we may be subject to future claims  including relating to environmental damage  safety conditions at our mines  the two fatal accidents that occurred at the lucky friday mine and other related matters 
the outcomes of these pending and potential claims are uncertain 
we may not resolve these claims favorably 
depending on the outcome  these actions could have adverse financial effects or cause reputational harm to us 
if any of these disputes result in a substantial monetary judgment against us  are settled on terms in excess of our current accruals  or otherwise impact our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for a description of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
for example  we estimate that our greens creek tailings impoundment area has sufficient capacity to meet our needs through in order to increase the tailings capacity at the mine  a permit is required 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays or halt the continuation of mining operations depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
interested parties may seek to prevent issuance of permits and intervene in the process or pursue extensive appeal rights 
past or ongoing violations of government mining laws could provide a basis to revoke existing permits or to deny the issuance of additional permits 
in addition  evolving reclamation or environmental concerns may threaten our ability to renew existing permits or obtain new permits in connection with future development  expansions and operations 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we are required to post surety bonds or cash collateral to secure our reclamation obligations and we may be unable to obtain the required surety bonds or may not have the resources to provide cash collateral 
similarly  we will require the consent of msha to reopen the silver shaft and resume operations at the lucky friday mine upon completion of refurbishing the shaft walls 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
for example  in both of our operating mines received several citations  and the lucky friday mine also received several orders  under the mine safety and health act of  as administered by msha 
further  we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits or disputes in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage  violating environmental laws  or violating environmental permits  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits or disputes in the future 
see risk titled our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
exposure to these liabilities arises not only from our existing operations  but from operations that have been closed or sold to third parties 
we are required to reclaim properties after mining is completed and specific requirements vary among jurisdictions 
in some cases  we may be required to provide financial assurances as security for reclamation costs  which may exceed our estimates for such costs 
our historical operations and the historical operations of entities and properties we have acquired have occasionally been alleged to have generated environmental contamination 
we could also be held liable for worker exposure to hazardous substances 
there can be no assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with all environmental  health and safety regulations or that steps to achieve compliance would not materially adversely affect our business 
in addition to existing regulatory requirements  legislation and regulations may be adopted or permit limits reduced at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
mining accidents and fatalities  whether or not at our mines or related to silver mining  may increase the likelihood of additional regulation or changes in law 
in addition  enforcement or regulatory tools and methods available to governmental regulators such as the us environmental protection agency which have not been used or seldomly used against us  could in the future be used against us 
federal or state environmental or mine safety regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations  or financial condition 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions are in various phases of consideration 
if adopted  such measures could increase our cost of environmental compliance and also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities 
proposed measures could also result in increased cost of fuel and other consumables used at our operations  including the diesel generation of electricity at our greens creek operation if we are unable to regularly access utility power 
climate change legislation may also affect our smelter customers who burn fossil fuels  resulting in increased costs to us  and may affect the market for the metals we produce with effects on prices that are not possible for us to predict 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 
although we are not currently mining on federal land  exploration and future mining could occur on federal land 
the clean water act requires permits for operations that discharge into waters of the united states 
such permitting has been a frequent subject of litigation by environmental advocacy groups  which has resulted  and may in the future result  in declines in such permits or extensive delays in receiving them 
this may result in delays in  or in some instances preclude  the commencement or continuation of development or production operations 
adverse outcomes in lawsuits challenging permits or failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the suspension  denial  or revocation of required permits  which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations  or financial condition 
our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho through our subsidiary hecla limited 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental obligations  including million accrued for hecla limited s various liabilities in idaho 
as of the date of this report  these accrual balances included a total of million for our remaining obligation for environmental claims with respect to the entire coeur d alene basin in northern idaho 
a settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims was finalized with entry of the consent decree by the court in september for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
shipment of our products is subject to regulatory and related risks 
certain of the products we ship to our customers are subject to regulatory requirements regarding packaging  handling and shipping of products that may be considered to be dangerous to human health or the environment 
although we believe we are currently in compliance with all material regulations applicable to packaging  handling and shipping our products  the chemical properties of our products or existing regulations could change and cause us to fall out of compliance  or force us to incur substantial additional expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations 
further  we do not ship our own products but instead rely on third party carriers to ship our products to our customers 
to the extent that any of our carriers are unable or unwilling to ship our products in accordance with applicable regulations  including because of difficulty in obtaining  or increased cost of  insurance  we could be forced to find alternative shipping arrangements  assuming such alternatives would be available 
any such changes to our current shipping arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and outstanding preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our stock has been volatile  often based on changes in metals prices  particularly silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects  such as global economic developments  market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  or the reliability of metals markets  political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration programs  ability to meet production estimates  environmental  safety and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
we may not be able to pay common or preferred stock dividends in the future 
since july  we paid regular quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock through the third quarter of the annual dividend payable on the series b preferred stock is currently million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends on series b preferred stock since the second quarter of series b preferred stock dividends due on january   for the fourth quarter of and dividends due for the three quarters thereafter were deferred 
in january we paid all dividends in arrears and dividends due for the fourth quarter of for the series b preferred stock  and we paid all regular quarterly dividends for and however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
in september  our board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that links the amount of any declared dividend on our common stock to our average quarterly realized silver price in the preceding quarter 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on potential dividend amounts at various silver prices 
on november   our board of directors declared the first quarterly silver price linked dividend of per share million total  based on the average realized silver price in the third quarter of of per ounce 
on february   our board of directors declared a silver price linked common stock dividend  pursuant to the policy described above  of per share based on the average realized silver price of per ounce in the fourth quarter of in addition  in february  our board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that includes a minimum annual dividend of per share of common stock  payable quarterly when declared  and declared a dividend of per share pursuant to that policy 
therefore  the aggregate common stock dividend declared by ouir board of directors was per share  for a total of approximately million expected to be paid in the first quarter of the declaration and payment of common stock dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in the future 
additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share 
we may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes  including funding our obligations under any settlement of litigation of other claims 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business  including our market capitalization 
to the extent we issue any additional equity securities  the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced 
as of december   there were warrants outstanding for purchase of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants give the holders the right to purchase our common stock at the following prices  shares   shares  and  shares 
the remaining warrants expire in june and august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by any preferred stock we may issue 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
this includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
as noted above  as of december   there were warrants outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we issued million shares of our common stock in january of in connection with conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future issuances by us of our common stock or other equity will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  shares of our common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with material acquisition transactions or for other purposes  including funding of our obligations under any settlement of litigation or other claims 
the market price of our common stock could decline if certain large holders of our common stock  or recipients of our common stock  sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  these sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
if we cannot meet the new york stock exchange continued listing requirements  the nyse may delist our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse 
in the future  if we are not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the nyse  which require  among other things  that the average closing price of our common stock be above over consecutive trading days  our common stock may be delisted 
our closing stock price on february   was 
if we are unable to satisfy the nyse criteria for continued listing  our common stock would be subject to delisting 
a delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by  among other things  reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock  reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing  decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage for the company  and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future 
in addition  delisting from the nyse might negatively impact our reputation and  as a consequence  our business

item property descriptions operating properties the greens creek unit our various subsidiaries own of the greens creek mine  located in southeast alaska  which has been in production since  with a temporary care and maintenance period from april through july since the start of production  greens creek has been owned and operated through various joint venture arrangements involving a variety of partners  including us 
for approximately years prior to april   our wholly owned subsidiary  hecla alaska llc  owned an undivided joint venture interest in the assets of greens creek 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the equity of two rio tinto subsidiaries holding a interest in the greens creek mine for approximately million 
the acquisition gives our various subsidiaries control of of the greens creek mine 
the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed by boat and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock 
the map below illustrates the location and access to greens creek the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no production triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is adjusted annually according to the gross domestic product gdp implicit price deflator until the year  and at december   was at approximately per ton when applying the latest gdp implicit price deflator observation 
greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  to  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as gold dor 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately  tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  zinc  lead and gold 
the dor is further refined by precious metal refiners and sold to banks  and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the significant customers for greens creek s products 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 
electricity for the greens creek unit has historically been provided by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company  alaska electric light and power company ael p 
installation of the necessary infrastructure was completed in  and use of hydroelectric power commenced during the third quarter of the infrastructure is also used to provide power to surrounding communities 
this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
prior to  the low lake levels combined with the increased demand in the juneau area restricted the amount of power available to green creek 
in and  the mine received an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p 
hydroelectric power was also available during  but to a lesser extent compared to the previous two years due to lower precipitation 
when weather conditions are not favorable to maintain lake water levels  the mine relies on diesel generated power 
the employees at greens creek are employees of hecla greens creek mining company  our wholly owned subsidiary  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  as of december   we have recorded a million asset retirement obligation for reclamation and closure costs 
we continue to maintain a million reclamation bond for greens creek 
the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  based on current ore reserve estimates  the currently known remaining mine life at greens creek is years

estimates of proven and probable ore reserves for the greens creek unit as of december  and are calculated and reviewed in house and are derived from successive generations of reserve and feasibility analyses for different areas of the mine  using a separate assessment of metals prices for each year 
the average prices used for the greens creek unit were december  silver per ounce gold per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound ore reserves represent in place material  diluted and adjusted for expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries of ore reserve grades differ with ore grades and are expected to average for silver  for gold  for zinc and for lead 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to continued depletion of the deposit through production  partially offset by increases in forecasted precious metals prices 
the changes in reserves in versus were due to the lower ore grades for gold  zinc  and lead combined with continued depletion of the deposit  partially offset by increases in forecasted metals prices and additional drilling at the east ore zone 
we only report probable reserves at the greens creek unit  which are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
proven reserves typically require that mining samples are partly the basis of the ore grade estimates used  while probable reserve grade estimates can be based entirely on drilling results 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at greens creek  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade was per ton nsr

the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver  lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate below is a map illustrating the location and access to the lucky friday unit there have been two ore bearing structures mined at the lucky friday unit 
the first  mined through  was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the ore body is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of ore bodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous ore body in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the ore body has extended from  feet to  feet below surface 
the second ore bearing structure  known as the lucky friday expansion area  has been mined since pursuant to an operating agreement with silver hunter mining company silver hunter  our wholly owned subsidiary 
during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
at approximately  feet below surface  the gold hunter veins are hosted in a foot thick siliceous lens within the wallace formation that transitions to the st 
regis formation below  feet 
the veins are sub parallel  and are numbered consecutively from the hanging wall of the favorable horizon to the footwall 
the strike of the vein system is west northwest with a dip of degrees to the south 
the vein  which has demonstrated to contain higher silver grades  represents approximately of our current proven and probable ore reserve tonnages  while the remaining of our reserves are contained in various intermediate veins having lower silver grades than vein 
while the veins share many characteristics with the lucky friday vein  the gold hunter area possesses some mineralogical and rock mechanics differences that make it more favorable to mine at this time 
on november   we  through silver hunter  completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines company independence  including all future interest or royalty obligation to independence and the mining claims pertaining to the operating agreement with hecla limited that was assigned to silver hunter 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the ore body 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a conventional flotation mill  which produces both a lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc 
all silver lead and zinc concentrate production during was shipped to teck cominco limited s smelter in trail  british columbia  canada 
based on current reserve estimates  the currently known remaining mine life at the lucky friday is approximately years 
information with respect to the lucky friday unit s production  average cost per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves for the past three years is set forth in the table below

proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by ore body and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at the lucky friday  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade at the lucky friday ranges from per ton nsr to per ton nsr 
our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices december  silver per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work  an increase in mining widths in areas utilizing mechanized mining  and increases in forecasted metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work  higher ore grades  and increases in forecasted metals prices  which resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
lucky friday ore reserve estimates were prepared by terry devoe  chief geologist at the lucky friday unit and reviewed by john taylor  senior resource geologist at hecla limited 
an independent audit by scott wilson roscoe postle associates inc was completed in january for the reserve model at the lucky friday mine 
a number of accidents and other events have recently impacted operations at the lucky friday 
in april  a fall of ground caused the fatality of one employee  resulting in cessation of operations for approximately days 
in november  an accident occurred as part of the construction of shaft and resulted in the fatality of one contractor employee 
in an unrelated incident  in december  a rock burst occurring in a primary access way at the lucky friday injured seven employees  with no fatalities as a result of that incident 
at the end of  the mine safety health administration began a special impact inspection at the lucky friday which resulted in an order to remove loose material from the silver shaft  the primary access way from surface at the lucky friday mine 
in response  we submitted a plan to msha and received approval to remove the loose cementitious material 
in addition  the plan includes removal of unused utilities  construction of a water ring to prevent ice from forming in the winter  the installation of a metal brattice  repair of shaft steel  and installation of a new power cable  all of which should improve the shaft s functionality and possibly improve the shaft s hoisting capacity 
once the shaft cleanup has been complete down to the level  work on a haulage way bypassing the area at the level impacted by the december rock burst is expected to commence 
underground access will be limited eg  to allow maintenance of pumps in the mine as this work is being performed  and we anticipate that production at the lucky friday mine will be suspended until early as a result 
we anticipate returning to full production levels at the lucky friday once the silver shaft work and work related to the haulage way bypass is complete 
during  we initiated engineering  procurement and development activities relating to construction of shaft at the lucky friday mine  which  upon completion  would provide access from the level down to the level of the mine 
the project was temporarily placed on hold in the fourth quarter of due to then prevailing metals prices 
however  detailed engineering  long lead time procurement  and other early stage activities for the internal shaft project resumed in activities in and included engineering  erection of a surface concrete batch plant  and work on shaft  including detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  installation of the hoist and head works  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  advancement of a geotechnical drill hole  feet of vertical excavation  shaft sinking set up  and other construction activities 
upon completion  shaft would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings and provide deeper platforms for exploration 
the board of directors approved the shaft project in its entirety in august construction of shaft is expected to take approximately three more years to complete after re commencement  and capital expenditures for the project are forecast to total approximately million  including approximately million spent on the project through december  as a result of the requirement to remove any loose material from the silver shaft discussed above  work on the shaft project will be suspended until the silver shaft rehabilitation is completed 
we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to proceed at that time 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect completion of the project  including a significant decline in metals prices or a significant increase in operating or capital costs 
an increase in the capital cost could potentially require us to suspend the project or access additional capital though debt financing  the sale of securities  or other external sources 
this additional financing could be costly or unavailable 
reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed at lucky friday in  and at december   an asset retirement obligation of approximately million had been recorded for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside contractors as needed 
at december   there were employees at the lucky friday unit 
united steel  paper and forestry  rubber  manufacturing  energy  allied industrial  and service workers international union is the bargaining agent for the lucky friday s hourly employees 
the current labor agreement expires on april  as a result of the requirement to remove loose material from the silver shaft discussed above  which will limit underground access and temporarily suspend production at the lucky friday  hecla limited laid off employees in january  with approximately of those employees accepting temporary positions at other hecla operations 
we anticipate that employment levels at the lucky friday will return to where they were at prior to the suspension of production as the silver shaft work is completed

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the potential per share dividend amounts at different quarterly average realized price levels according to the policy 
on november   our board of directors declared the first quarterly silver price linked dividend of per share million total  based on the average realized silver price in the third quarter of of per ounce  which was paid in december on february   our board of directors declared a silver price linked common stock dividend  pursuant to the policy described above  of per share based on the average realized silver price of per ounce in the fourth quarter of in addition  in february  our board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that includes a minimum annual dividend of per share of common stock  payable quarterly when declared  and declared a dividend of per share pursuant to that policy 
therefore  the aggregate common stock dividend declared by our board of directors was per share  for a total of approximately million expected to be paid in the first quarter of the declaration and payment of common stock dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors

million of the dividends declared in were paid in cash  and are included in the amount reported as cash dividends paid per mandatory convertible preferred share  and million of the dividends declared in were paid in our common stock 
mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends for the fourth quarter of totaling million were deferred 
dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock totaling million for the first three quarters of were deferred 
in december  we declared the million in dividends in arrears on our mandatory convertible preferred stock and the scheduled million dividend for the fourth quarter of these dividends were paid in shares of our common stock in january therefore  dividends declared on our mandatory convertible preferred stock of million were included in the determination of income applicable to common shareholders for with no cash paid for mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends in we declared and paid all quarterly dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock totaling million for dividends declared for the first and second quarters of were paid in shares of our common stock and dividends for the third and fourth quarters of were paid in cash 
the cash dividend declared for the fourth quarter of  which was paid in january  represents the last dividend to be paid on the mandatory convertible preferred stock  which automatically converted to shares of our common stock on january on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the equity of two rio tinto subsidiaries holding a interest in the greens creek mine for approximately million 
the acquisition gives our various subsidiaries control of of the greens creek mine 
our operating results reflect our ownership of greens creek after april  and our ownership of greens creek prior to that date 
on july   we completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of el callao gold mining company and drake bering holdings bv  our wholly owned subsidiaries which together owned our business and operations in venezuela  the la camorra unit 
the results of the venezuelan operations have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an accrual of million to increase our liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of settlement of the litigation and related claims 
the settlement was finalized in september for additional discussion  see coeur d alene river basin environmental claims in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview established in in northern idaho s silver valley  we believe we are the oldest precious metals mining company in the united states still operating and the largest silver producer in the us our corporate offices are in coeur d alene  idaho and vancouver  british columbia 
our production profile includes silver  gold  lead  and zinc contained in concentrates shipped to various smelters  and gold dor 
our operating properties comprise our two business segments for financial reporting purposes the greens creek operating unit on admiralty island in alaska and the lucky friday operating unit in idaho 
since both of our mines are located in the us  we believe they have low political risk  and less economic risk than mines located in other parts of the world 
our exploration interests are located in jurisdictions with low and relatively moderate political and economic risk in the united states and mexico  respectively  and are located in historically successful mining districts 
our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential 
in  we attained record revenue of million and gross profit of million  surpassing s previous record levels as a result of higher metals prices 
these results were in spite of challenges faced at the lucky friday mine relating to multiple accidents occurring during the year  as discussed further below 
finalized settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion committed a record level of capital investment at our existing operations  with capital expenditures in  including non cash capital lease additions  totaling approximately million  including million at lucky friday and million at greens creek 
we advanced work on construction of an internal shaft at the lucky friday unit 
had unrelated incidents at the lucky friday mine  resulting in two fatalities  a number of injuries  and the temporary halt of production 
increased overall proven and probable silver reserves at december  compared to their levels at the same time last year  with higher silver reserves at lucky friday due to results from drilling 
the increase in silver reserves at lucky friday was partially offset by a slight decrease in silver reserves at greens creek in due to depletion of the deposit through production 
acquired the remaining interest in the san juan silver exploration a pre development project at the creede mining district in colorado in december we completed work to earn in to a interest in the project earlier in the year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
increased our exploration and pre development spending during the year by in comparison to  drilling targets at each of our four land packages in alaska  idaho  colorado  and mexico and advancing pre development projects at the historic equity and bulldog mines in creede  colorado and the star mine in idaho s silver valley 
silver prices continued on a positive trend over the last three years  with the price climbing from annual averages of in and in  to an average of for the price of gold  a significant by product at our greens creek mine  followed a similar trend 
the annual average gold price increased from in to  in  and to  in average prices of our important base metals by products  lead and zinc  increased by and  respectively  in compared  and then remained substantially level during the positive performance in metals prices allowed us to achieve the milestones discussed above in spite of lower mill throughput at both greens creek and lucky friday  which resulted in decreased production of all four metals we produce in compared to we reported diluted income per share of in compared to in gross profit from operations improved to million in from million in primarily as a result of higher realized prices for all four metals we sell 
exploration and pre development costs were higher in due to increased drilling and other exploration activities at each of our land packages and pre development work done to access historical workings and establish underground drill platforms at the equity mine near creede  colorado  and at the star mine in idaho s silver valley to further evaluate potential mine re opening 
provision for closed operations and environmental matters decreased by million in due primarily to an increase in our estimated liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect the terms of the settlement later finalized 
we recognized a million gain on base metal derivatives contracts in compared to a million loss in in  we recorded an million income tax provision compared to a million benefit recorded in  with million of the benefit resulting from a decreased valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we removed substantially all of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  with the exception of certain amounts related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  as high levels of cash flows from operations and metals prices led us to conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable through estimated future profitability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the factors driving metals prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
as noted above  prices have been highly volatile in the last three years and could be so in the future 
average prices in compared to those in and are illustrated in the results of operations section below 
moreover  variations in the metal grades of ore mined are impacted by geology and mine planning efficiencies and operations  potentially creating constraints on metals produced 
ore transportation and smelting schedules also impact the timing of sales and final settlement 
key issues we intend to achieve our long term strategy of increasing production and expanding our proven and probable reserves through development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we manage several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining  development  exploration and metal sales at multiple locations 
one such risk involves metals prices  over which we have no control except through derivative and other contracts 
as discussed in the critical accounting estimates section below  metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control 
average market prices of silver  gold  zinc and lead in all were higher than their levels in  as illustrated by the table in results of operations below 
we believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand growth for the metals we produce 
however  prices have been volatile over the last five years and there can be no assurance that higher prices will continue 
we make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which may impact new opportunities that require many years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing in exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
we significantly increased our exploration and pre development activity in compared to  and we anticipate a further increase in the coming year at or near our operating mines at greens creek and lucky friday  as well as at our exploration projects in the past producing mining districts in colorado and mexico 
as discussed in the financial liquidity and capital resources section below  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  investments  projected cash from operations  and availability of financing  if needed  will be adequate to meet our obligations during the next twelve months  including obligations relating to growth opportunities 
one such opportunity is the construction of an internal shaft at the lucky friday mine shaft  which  we believe  will significantly increase production and extend the life of the mine 
the shaft project will involve significant additional capital costs during the periods leading up to its expected completion date by the end of as discussed in the lucky friday segment section below  the requirement to remove loose material from the silver shaft will temporarily suspend work on the shaft project 
although we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to continue work on shaft  when use of the silver shaft is restored  and complete the project  there are a number of factors that could affect its completion 
volatility in global financial markets poses a significant challenge to our ability to access credit and equity markets  should we need to do so  and to predict sales prices for our products 
our stock price  although volatile  has rebounded from its lowest levels in we eliminated our debt in partly by increasing our shares of common stock outstanding by during and issuing warrants at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
our shares of common stock outstanding increased by an additional in primarily as a result of exercises of warrants issued in and  and by an additional in primarily as a result of the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock in january we have also entered into a three year  million revolving credit agreement under which there are no outstanding borrowings as of december   yet our ability to retain the facility depends in part on financial thresholds driven by the prices of products we sell 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in risk factors and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities and our ability to estimate liabilities in general may change in the future  affecting our strategic plans 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we finalized the terms of settlement with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation  which has assisted our planning efforts by decreasing uncertainty regarding our liability and our liquidity needs relating to our most significant environmental matter 
however  we are involved in other environmental legal matters  and there can be no assurance that the estimate of our environmental liabilities  liquidity needs  or strategic plans will not be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise 
in addition  proposed measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see item a 
risk factors legal  market and regulatory risks we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
we intend to continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to attempt to settle the environmental litigation 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
until ore is actually mined and processed  the volumes and grades of our reserves must be considered as estimates 
our reserves are depleted as we mine 
reserves can also change as a result of changes in metals prices and costs  as well as economic and operating assumptions 
we strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance 
we seek to implement this goal by training employees in safe work practices  openly communicating with employees  establishing  following and improving safety standards  investigating accidents  incidents and losses to avoid recurrence  and involving employees in the establishment of safety standards 
we attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness 
in spite of these efforts  two fatal accidents and another incident involving injury to seven employees occurred at our lucky friday mine during at the end of  msha began a special impact inspection at the lucky friday mine which resulted in an order to remove loose material from the silver shaft  the primary access way from surface at the lucky friday mine  even though such shaft was not involved in the rock burst or any of the other incidents which occurred in underground access will be limited as the silver shaft work is completed  and we anticipate that production will be suspended at the lucky friday mine until early as a result 
see the lucky friday segment section below for more information 
we continue to evaluate our safety practices and work with msha to address issues outlined in the investigations of these incidents 
as a result of industry wide fatal accidents in recent years  primarily at underground coal mines  there has been an increase in mining regulation in the united states 
this increase has taken the form of vigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations  and the adoption of new safety and training regulations  primarily by msha 
in addition  under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the securities and exchange commission was directed to issue new rules regarding the disclosure of mine safety data 
these changes may have a significant effect on our future operating costs  in the form of increased costs for monitoring and administration of and by regulatory agencies 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported income applicable to common shareholders of million compared to million in and million in the following factors had a positive impact on results for the year ended december  compared to and increased gross profit at our greens creek and lucky friday units in compared to and see the greens creek segment and lucky friday segment sections below for further discussion of operating results 
provision for closed operations and environmental matters of million in compared to million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an accrual of million to increase our liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of settlement of the litigation and related claims 
the settlement was finalized in september for additional discussion  see coeur d alene river basin environmental claims in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net gain on base metal forward contracts of million in compared to a net loss of million in there was no comparable gain or loss reported in  as the forward contract program was initiated in june these gains and losses are related to financially settled forward contracts on forecasted zinc and lead production as part of a risk management program 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk management for more information on our derivatives contracts 
interest expense decreased to million in and million in from million in due to repayment in of debt incurred for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in greens creek 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt facilities 
debt related fees in representing million in expense recognized in the first quarter of for preferred stock issued pursuant to our credit agreement and million in professional fees incurred in related to compliance with our amended and restated credit agreement 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
in the second quarter of we recognized a million loss on impairment of shares of rusoro stock received in the sale of our discontinued venezuelan operations compared to a million impairment loss recognized on the rusoro stock recognized during the second quarter of and a million impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of related to stock held in another mining company 
higher average prices for all four metals produced at our operations in compared to and the following table summarizes average market prices and our realized prices for silver  gold  lead and zinc for the years ended december   and average for the year ended december  silver london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce gold london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce lead lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound zinc lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement  which differ from average market prices 
due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with the smelters  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement 
for  we recorded net negative adjustments to provisional settlements of million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of million and million in and  respectively 
the price adjustments related to zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for lead and zinc 
we recognized overall net gains on the contracts of million in and net losses of million in because the forward contracts program was not initiated until april  there were no comparable gains or losses in realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate and dor shipped during the period 
the differences between our realized metal prices and average market prices are due primarily to the aforementioned gains and losses on forward contracts for lead and zinc and price adjustments resulting from the difference between metal prices upon transfer of title of concentrates to the buyer and metal prices at the time of final settlement  which are included in our revenues 
other significant variances affecting the comparison of our income applicable to common shareholders for to results for and were as follows income tax provision in of million compared to income tax benefits in and of million and million  respectively 
the provision is primarily due to the utilization of deferred tax assets as a result of increased profits 
the benefits recognized in and are the result of valuation allowance adjustments to our deferred tax asset balances 
these adjustments are included in the aggregate income tax benefit provision for each respective period 
our deferred tax asset balances are recorded net of an offsetting valuation allowance to the extent that we estimate that the assets are not realizable through future taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of  we removed substantially all of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
significant evidence in  including record cash flows from operations and higher metals prices  led us to conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable due to estimated future profitability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
exploration and pre development expense increased to million in from million in and million in as we continue extensive exploration work at our greens creek unit  on our land package near durango  mexico  at our san juan silver project in the creede district of colorado  and in the north idaho s coeur d alene mining district near our lucky friday unit 
pre development expense is defined as costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production  such as underground ramp development  which are expensed due to the lack of proven and probable reserves 
establishing proven and probable reserves would indicate future recovery of these expenses 
we have advanced pre development projects during at the equity and bulldog mines in the creede district and at the star mine in the coeur d alene district which have given us access to historic workings and underground drill platforms 
the termination of an employee benefit plan resulting in a non cash gain of million recognized in the first quarter of the sale of our velarde a mill in mexico in march generating a pre tax gain of million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the sale of our investment in aquiline resources inc stock for proceeds and a pre tax gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of greens creek segment below is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our greens creek segment 
years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization gross profit tons of ore milled production silver ounces gold ounces zinc tons lead tons payable metal quantities sold silver ounces gold ounces zinc tons lead tons ore grades silver ounces per ton gold ounces per ton zinc percent lead percent mining cost per ton milling cost per ton total cash cost per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in reconciliation of total cash costs to costs non gaap of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in gross profit for compared to and was primarily the result of the following factors higher average market and realized prices in for all four metals produced at greens creek compared to and  as further discussed in results of operations above 
lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in of million and  respectively  compared to and as a result of lower metals production due to lower ore volume and ore grades for all four metals 
the ore volume decreases are primarily due to the lack of availability of higher volume long hole stopes  while the ore grade variances are due to differences in the sequencing of production from the various mine areas pursuant to the overall mine plan 
mine license taxes decreased in by million compared to and increased by million compared to the lower taxes in compared to is a result of million refund from the state of alaska relating to prior year s returns 
these factors were partially offset by negative price adjustments to revenues of million  net of base metal forward contract gains  during compared to positive price adjustments of million and million in and  respectively 
price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period 
the impact of negative price adjustments for lead and zinc in was substantially offset by net gains of million on financially settled forward contracts 
positive price adjustments for lead and zinc in were substantially offset by net losses of million on financially settled forward contracts 
the base metal forward contract program was initiated in april and there were no comparable gains or losses impacting production costs per ton of ore milled for increased by compared to  whereas  remained within of their levels 
the higher costs in are mainly attributable to lower ore volume and higher power costs due to increased reliance in on more expensive diesel generated power resulting from lower utility availability 
the greens creek operation is partially powered by diesel generators  and production costs have historically been significantly affected by fluctuations in fuel prices and utility power availability 
infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by ael p via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
during  the mine began receiving an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p  and we have continued to receive hydroelectric power  with reduced availability in compared to the previous two years 
fuel costs represented approximately of total production costs at greens creek in compared to in and in mining and milling costs per ton increased in by and  respectively  compared to the same period in and by and  respectively  for the same period in the increases were driven primarily by lower ore volume and higher power costs 
we generated more power on site in due to lower availability of less expensive hydroelectric power  the result of lower precipitation levels in southeastern alaska 
diesel fuel expense at greens creek increased by million in compared to the same period in and by million compared to the same period in the result is due to an increase in fuel consumption of and compared to and  respectively  as well as an increase in the cost of diesel 
the increase in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to production costs  treatment and freight costs  and production taxes that increased by   and per ounce  respectively  partially offset by higher by product credits of per ounce 
the increase in by product credits is due to higher prices  in spite of lower ore grades  for all four metals 
the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to by product credits that increased by per ounce  due to higher zinc  gold  and lead prices and production  partially offset by higher treatment and freight costs  production costs  and production taxes of   and per ounce  respectively 
the higher treatment and freight costs in are due primarily to increased price participation charges by smelters resulting from higher metals prices 
the difference between what we report as production and payable metal quantities sold is due essentially to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrate we produce versus the portion of those metals actually payable by our smelter customers according to the terms of the smelter contracts 
differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  and in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production within our cost per ounce calculations  the values of these metals offset operating costs 
the lucky friday segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our lucky friday segment dollars are in thousands  except per ounce and per ton amounts years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization gross profit tons of ore milled production silver ounces lead tons zinc tons payable metal quantities sold silver ounces lead tons zinc tons ore grades silver ounces per ton lead percent zinc percent mining cost per ton milling cost per ton total cash cost per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below in reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in gross profit for compared to and is primarily due to higher average market and realized prices for all metals produced at the lucky friday further discussed in results of operations above  partially offset by higher cost of sales and other direct production costs due primarily to increased employee profit sharing and taxes resulting from increased profitability 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense for was lower than in and lower than in due to reduced units of production depreciation 
the majority of the decrease was incidental to an extension of expected mine life at lucky friday  resulting in the book value of units of production assets being depreciated over a longer duration 
the extension of the expected mine life is primarily due to the positive economics of the shaft project which  when completed  will provide deeper access beyond the current workings see below for further discussion of the shaft project 
in addition  production was lower in compared the previous two years  primarily due to down time related to the accidents discussed below 
mining and milling costs per ton increased in by and  respectively  compared to and by and  respectively  compared to primarily due to lower production and higher costs of fuel  consumable underground materials  reagents  and maintenance supplies 
the increase in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is due primarily to higher profit sharing and other costs by per ounce  higher treatment and freight costs by per ounce  and higher production costs by per ounce  partially offset by higher by product credits by per ounce resulting from higher lead and zinc prices 
the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is due primarily to higher by product credits by per ounce resulting from higher lead and zinc prices  partially offset by higher employee profit sharing  production  expensed site infrastructure  and treatment and freight costs by    and per ounce  respectively 
the difference between what we report as production and payable metal quantities sold is due to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually payable by our smelter customers according to the terms of the smelter contracts 
the decrease in payable quantities sold in compared to and is attributable to a decrease in production due mainly to various down time periods related to the accidents discussed below 
while value from lead and zinc is significant at the lucky friday  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production within our cost per ounce calculations  the values of these metals offset operating costs 
on april   a fall of ground  which caused a fatality  occurred at the lucky friday mine  leading us to immediately halt all operations other than the rescue and recovery efforts at the mine 
operations resumed approximately days after the accident occurred 
the accident involved a localized fall of ground at feet below surface in an area known as the west stope 
msha had representatives on site at the lucky friday periodically from april  through june in addition to our decision to immediately halt mining operations pending rescue and recovery efforts  msha issued orders to hecla limited under sections j and k of the federal mine safety health act of mine safety act  prohibiting all activity in the west stope except to the extent necessary for rescue and recovery operations or to prevent or eliminate an imminent danger 
subsequent to the recovery efforts and reopening of other portions of the mine  msha issued orders under section k of the mine safety act prohibiting all activity in stopes and  pending msha s determination that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in those areas 
operations resumed in stope in june  and in stope in july with msha approval  and msha has completed their investigation of the accident 
on november   an accident occurred as part of the construction of the shaft discussed below  resulting in the fatality of an employee of the shaft contractor 
the accident was caused by the collapse of under foot material during construction of an underground rock bin 
mining operations at the lucky friday mine were immediately suspended on the day of the accident  and msha subsequently issued an order under section j of the mine safety act  prohibiting activity in the area impacted by the accident except to the extent necessary for investigation purposes 
the shaft construction activity resumed in november with msha s approval 
on december   a rock burst resulting from natural seismic activity approximately feet below surface resulted in non life threatening injuries to seven employees 
the employees were working on installation of a steel liner to enhance a primary access way damaged by a previous rock burst occurring on november  that rock burst was caused by mine blasting at the end of a shift  and no employees were impacted at the time of the rock burst 
we evacuated the mine and halted operations on december  and msha subsequently issued an order under section k closing the mine  which is currently in effect 
in december  we determined that a new haulage way to bypass the area impacted by the rock burst is required 
once construction of the bypass has started  we expect it will take approximately two months to complete 
at the end of  msha began a special impact inspection at the lucky friday mine which resulted in an order to remove loose material from the silver shaft  even though the silver shaft was not involved in the rock burst or any of the other incidents which occurred in the silver shaft is an approximately one mile deep  foot diameter  concrete lined shaft from surface and the primary access to the lucky friday mine s underground workings 
in response  we submitted a plan to msha and received approval to remove the loose cementitious material 
in addition  the plan includes removal of unused utilities  construction of a water ring to prevent ice from forming in the winter  the installation of a metal brattice  repair of shaft steel  and installation of a new power cable  all of which should improve the shaft s functionality and possibly improving the shaft s hoisting capacity 
we currently anticipate that the silver shaft work will be completed in late  with production at the lucky friday temporarily suspended until early during this period  the smelter contracts related to treatment of lucky friday concentrates have been suspended based on force majeure 
we anticipate that we will be able to commence construction of the haulage way bypass around the rock burst area discussed in the preceding paragraph once the silver shaft cleanup has been completed down to the level and resume work on the shaft project in early once the silver shaft work is completed 
work continued during on the shaft project  an internal shaft at the lucky friday mine which  upon completion  will provide deeper access in order to expand the mine s operational life 
we commenced engineering and construction activities on shaft in late  and our board of directors gave its final approval of the project in august construction of the shaft as currently designed is expected to cost a total of approximately million  including approximately million already spent as of december   with completion expected in late as discussed above  the shaft construction will be temporarily suspended until cleanup work in the silver shaft is completed 
once construction of shaft resumes  we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to complete the project 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect completion of the project  including i a significant decline in metals prices  ii a reduction in available cash or credit  whether arising from decreased cash flow or other uses of available cash  or iii a significant increase in operating or capital costs 
corporate matters other significant variances affecting results compared to results were as follows an increase in other operating expense of million in was primarily due to an increase in pension plan actuarial liabilities 
see note of notes to condensed consolidation financial statements for more information 
decrease in provision for closed operations and environmental matters in by million due primarily to a provision of million recorded in the fourth quarter of to increase our liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of settlement of the litigation and related claims 
the settlement was finalized in september mark to market gains on financially settled forward contracts for forecasted lead and zinc sales totaled million in compared to mark to market losses of million in interest expense increased by million in due to the accrual of pre lodging interest associated with the proposed terms of potential settlement with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation that took place in the second quarter of the pre lodging interest period ended with lodging of the consent decree with the court in june see note of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information 
income tax provisions totaled million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the higher current year provisions are the result of increased pre tax income and release of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in see note of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information 
other significant variances affecting our results compared to results were as follows a gain of million in on the sale of our mill in mexico  with no similar event in termination of an employee benefit plan in with a gain of million  with no similar event in other operating expense included cash donations totaling million in to the hecla charitable foundation for its charitable work  including supporting the communities in which hecla has employees and interests 
this was offset by a decrease in pension benefit costs recognized resulting from an increase in the expected returns calculated for plan assets due to higher plan asset values 
higher provision for closed operations and environmental matters in by million 
the principal cause of the increase was a million increase in our accrual for environmental obligations related to the coeur d alene basin  compared to million in the increase in was pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of potential settlement of the litigation and related claims 
for further discussion  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and debt related fees were million lower in as a result of payoff in of corporate debt  offset partly by increased capital leases in mark to market losses on financially settled forward contracts for forecasted lead and zinc sales totaling million in the program commenced in april  and hence  no such activity was reported in an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit is primarily related to deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustments of million partially offset by current income tax provision and amortization of deferred tax assets 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
employee benefit plans our defined benefit pension plans  while affording a significant benefit to our employees  also represent a significant liability 
during  the funded status of our plans changed from a liability of million at the first of the year to million at the end of the year 
the increased liability was attributable to decreased returns on plan assets  the effect of decreased interest rates on future benefits  and higher service cost attributable to a higher employee count 
unrecognized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  which will be amortized over future years  increased by million during the year  and we expect to contribute million to the hecla plan in while the economic variables which will determine future cash requirements are uncertain  we expect contributions to increase in future years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes our net deferred tax asset at december  totaled million  or of total assets  a decrease of million from the previous year end balance of million 
the largest component of the deferred tax asset is deferred reclamation  of which the majority will be realized in the next two years  assuming adequate taxable income 
the next largest component derives from the tax effect of past net operating losses carried forward to be applied against current income to determine cash income tax liability 
each reporting period  we assess our deferred tax assets with long range forecasts to provide reasonable assurance that they will be realized through future earnings 
as a result of such modeling  in we removed a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets following analysis of our operational plans and increased prices  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
at december   with the exception of million relating to net operating loss carry forwards for states where we currently have no activity and million for foreign tax credits  we retained no valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets 
a million valuation allowance remains on losses in foreign jurisdictions 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  our effective tax rate was for  based on our review of statutory rates and permanent book tax differences 
we currently expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately  with the increase from attributable to the loss of percentage depletion related to the lucky friday mine as a result of the temporary suspension of production there 
reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap the tables below present reconciliations between non gaap total cash costs to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap for our operations at the greens creek and lucky friday units for the years ended december   and in thousands  except costs per ounce 
total cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals  including mining  processing and other plant costs  third party refining expense  on site general and administrative costs  royalties and mining production taxes  net of by product revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit 
total cash costs provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period to period from a cash flow perspective 
total cash cost per ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard  however  there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs 
the sum of the cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization for our operating units in the tables below is presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
total  all properties year ended december  total cash costs divided by silver ounces produced total cash cost per ounce produced reconciliation to gaap total cash costs depreciation  depletion and amortization treatment costs by product credits change in product inventory suspension related costs reclamation and other costs cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap greens creek unit year ended december  total cash costs divided by silver ounces produced total cash cost per ounce produced reconciliation to gaap total cash costs depreciation  depletion and amortization treatment costs by product credits change in product inventory reclamation and other costs cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap lucky friday unit year ended december  total cash costs divided by silver ounces produced total cash cost per ounce produced reconciliation to gaap total cash costs depreciation  depletion and amortization treatment costs by product credits change in product inventory suspension related costs reclamation and other costs cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap various accidents and other events resulted in temporary suspensions of production at the lucky friday unit during see the lucky friday segment section for further discussion of these events 
care and maintenance  mine rehabilitation  investigation  and other costs incurred during the suspension periods not related to production have been excluded from total cash costs and the calculation of total cash cost per ounce produced 
financial liquidity and capital resources our liquid assets include in millions december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents held in us dollars cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currency marketable equity securities  current marketable equity securities  non current total cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents held in us dollars decreased by million in  as discussed below 
cash held in foreign currencies represent nominal balances in canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
the value of current marketable securities decreased by million due to the sale of securities during the first quarter of  while non current marketable equity securities increased by million due primarily to the purchase of mining company securities in march in  hecla limited s negotiations with representatives of the united states  the state of idaho and the coeur d alene tribe regarding settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims culminated in a comprehensive settlement reflected in a final and binding consent decree entered by the court on september  as a result of entry of the consent decree  hecla limited made payments totaling approximately million to the plaintiffs in early october  thereby decreasing our cash and cash equivalents accordingly 
hecla limited remains obligated under the consent decree to make the following payments million of cash by october   million of cash by october   and approximately million by august  as quarterly payments of the proceeds from the exercise of any outstanding series and series warrants which have an exercise price of between and per share during the quarter  with the remaining balance  if any  due in august  regardless of whether any of the remaining warrants are exercised 
the foregoing payments require third party surety for which hecla limited pays an annual maintenance fee which will decrease as payments are made according to the foregoing schedule 
the first annual maintenance fee of million was paid in october the million and million payments accrue interest from the entry of the consent decree until payment at the superfund rate for  for 
in addition to the foregoing payments  hecla limited is obligated to provide the plaintiffs with a limited amount of land it currently owns to be used as a repository waste site 
we entered into a million credit facility in april of for the acquisition of the companies owning of the joint venture operating the greens creek mine 
we fully repaid the facility with a final payment of million from available cash in october we also entered into senior secured revolving credit facility in october  which was amended in october to increase the facility to million 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes and  based on our current cash position and business plan  we do not currently anticipate drawing on the facility in the near term 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on how the covenants in our credit facility may impact our liquidity and capital resources in the future 
we may engage in other transactions  such as additional acquisition opportunities or capital projects  which could require additional equity issuances or financing 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to us 
as a result of our current cash balance  the performance of our operations  current metals prices  and full availability of our million revolving credit agreement  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  investments  projected cash from operations  and availability of financing if needed will be adequate to meet our obligations during the next twelve months  including the required settlement payments previously discussed  anticipated capital costs related to rehabilitation of the silver shaft and care and maintenance costs incurred at lucky friday as that work is completed  capital outlays for the shaft project  and payment of potential common stock dividends each of these items are discussed further below 
we currently estimate that a total of approximately million will be incurred on capital expenditures for equipment  infrastructure  and development at our lucky friday and greens creek units in  including capital costs for anticipated work on the lucky friday silver shaft  as discussed further below 
we also estimate that exploration and pre development expenditures will total approximately million in  however  these expenditures may increase based upon the success of programs that are currently ongoing 
to increase production and mine life at the lucky friday mine  we continued the shaft project during work on the project thus far has included detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development to access shaft facilities  installation of the hoist and head works  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  and other construction activities 
the shaft project  as currently designed  is expected to involve development down to the foot level and capital expenditures of approximately million  which includes approximately million that has been spent on the project as of december  our ability to finance this project will depend on our operational performance  metals prices  our ability to estimate capital costs  sources of liquidity available to us  and other factors 
shaft construction has been temporarily suspended until work to be performed on the silver shaft discussed further below is completed 
once construction resumes  we believe that our available cash  revolving credit agreement  cash from operations  and access to equity and financial markets will allow us to proceed with the shaft despite the required payments under the consent decree which settled the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and other obligations 
we may also mitigate market risk from time to time with selective base metal derivative contract programs 
however  a sustained downturn in metals prices or significant increases in operational or capital costs  other uses of cash  or other factors beyond our control could compel us to defer development below feet 
at the end of  msha began a special impact inspection of the lucky friday mine  and as a result msha issued an order closing down the silver shaft  the primary access from surface at the lucky friday  until we remove loose material from the shaft 
as discussed further in the lucky friday segment section above  we anticipate that production will be suspended until early as the silver shaft work and planned construction of a haulage way to bypass an area damaged by a rock burst is completed 
work on the silver shaft is expected to include removal of the loose cementitious material  removal of unused utilities  construction of a water ring to prevent ice from forming in the winter  the installation of a metal brattice  repair of shaft steel  and installation of a new power cable  all of which should improve the shaft s functionality and possibly improving the shaft s hoisting capacity 
in addition to work on the silver shaft  other significant surface and underground capital programs are being planned for final plans are not complete  but we expect to spend up to million on all of these projects  including approximately million to remove the loose cementitious material  million for shaft improvements and million on other capital projects 
we expect to incur non capitalized expenses of million for the care and maintenance of the mine  based on the assumption that the mine will be on standby for the remainder of as this work is completed 
we believe that our available cash and other financial resources will allow us to complete the silver shaft work and sustain temporary care and maintenance of the lucky friday mine until production resumes in early in september  our board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that links the anticipated amount of any declared dividend on our common stock to our average realized silver price in the preceding quarter 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the potential per share dividend amounts at different quarterly average realized price levels according to the policy 
on november   our board of directors declared the first quarterly silver price linked dividend of per share million total  based on the average realized silver price in the third quarter of of per ounce  which was paid in december on february   our board of directors declared a silver price linked common stock dividend  pursuant to the policy described above  of per share based on the average realized silver price of per ounce in the fourth quarter of in addition  in february  our board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that includes a minimum annual dividend of per share of common stock  payable quarterly when declared  and declared a dividend of per share pursuant to that policy 
therefore  the aggregate common stock dividend declared by our board of directors was per share  for a total of approximately million expected to be paid in the first quarter of the declaration and payment of common stock dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors 
on january   all of the outstanding shares of our mandatory convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of our common stock  and we paid the final quarterly dividend on that series of preferred stock in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we are no longer required to pay quarterly dividends of approximately million as a result of the conversion 
year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in compared to due to working capital and other asset and liability changes 
this is partially offset by higher income  as adjusted for non cash items  due to higher prices for all four metals produced at our operations 
working capital and other asset and liability changes decreased cash flow by million in  compared to a million increase in the million difference is due to decreases in accrued reclamation and closure costs  accounts payable  accrued taxes  and other non current liabilities and increased inventory  partially offset by lower accounts receivable and higher accrued payroll and related benefits 
the decrease in accrued reclamation and closure costs is due primarily to approximately million paid to the plaintiffs in october according to the terms of the coeur d alene basin litigation settlement 
accounts payable also decreased due to payment of the final quarterly dividend on the mandatory convertible preferred stock in january  and a reduction in payables related to settled base metal forward contracts 
accrued tax balances decreased during the year due to pre payments of tax in excess of our estimated liability for the year and the refund of alaska mine license tax related to the amendment of tax returns for previous years 
other non current liabilities decreased as a result of a reduction in accruals for long term incentive compensation 
the decrease in accounts receivable and increase in inventory balances is due to the timing of concentrate shipments at our greens creek unit 
accrued payroll and related benefits balances increased due to the addition of personnel during the year and higher accruals for short term incentive compensation 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to due to higher income  as adjusted for non cash items 
the improved results are primarily due to higher prices for all four metals produced at our operations 
working capital and other asset and liability changes increased cash flow by million in  compared to a million decrease in the million difference is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liability and accrued taxes balances and lower trade accounts receivable  other current and noncurrent asset  and inventory balances  partially offset by lower payroll related accruals and higher cash reductions to accrued reclamation and closure costs 
the increase in accounts payable is due to increased activity at our operating units and the accrual of dividends in the fourth quarter of on our mandatory convertible preferred stock  which were paid in cash in january we recorded increased accruals for income and production taxes as a result of higher profitability at our operations 
the smaller increase in accounts receivable and decrease in inventory balances is due to the timing of concentrate shipments at our greens creek unit 
other current and noncurrent asset balances decreased due to the timing of payment of prepaid expenditures 
the lower accrued payroll and related benefits balance is due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter of the cash decrease in our reclamation accruals is due to the payment of million related to past response costs at the bunker hill superfund site  and increased reclamation work performed at our grouse creek site in year ended december  cash used in investing activities in millions we spent million on capital projects in  including million at lucky friday and million at greens creek  which  in the aggregate  was million higher than total capital expenditures of million in capital expenditures included million spent for projects at lucky friday and million for greens creek 
the increase in capital spending was due  in part  to advancement of various surface infrastructure projects at greens creek 
our restricted cash balances for environmental bonds were reduced by million in versus million in sales of investments yielded million in compared to million in capital expenditures for totaled million in compared to million in the increase was due  in part  to the deferral of projects in as a result of cost reduction efforts in response to the impact of the global economic crisis 
we received million in proceeds from the sale of the velarde a mill in mexico in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the sale 
our restricted cash balances for environmental bonds were reduced by million in  and proceeds from sales of investments totaled million in year ended december  cash provided by used in financing activities in millions cash provided by financing activities for included million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options compared to million in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we paid cash dividends on our common stock of million in related to the silver price linked dividend adopted in september discussed above 
cash dividends on preferred stock totaled million in compared to million in million of the preferred stock dividends represented the last dividend on our mandatory convertible preferred stock  which converted to shares of our common stock in january repayments on our capital leases were million in versus million in in addition  we acquired treasury shares of our common stock having a value of million in and million in as a result of cashless employee stock option exercises 
our financing activities in included sales of common stock and warrants  which yielded million cash  net of related issuance costs 
net proceeds from the stock and warrant sales were applied to repayments of our debt facility totaling million and payments totaling million pursuant to our interest rate swap 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  non cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our outstanding purchase orders  certain capital expenditures  our credit facility as modified by amendments  and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total purchase obligations commitment fees contractual obligations capital lease commitments operating lease commitments coeur d alene basin litigation settlement surety maintenance fees supplemental executive retirement plan total contractual cash obligations consist of open purchase orders of approximately million at the greens creek unit and million at the lucky friday unit 
included in these amounts are approximately million and million related to various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units  respectively 
in october  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement  which was amended in march  july  and december it was amended again in october to increase the revolving credit agreement to million 
we are required to pay a standby fee  dependent on our leverage ratio  of between and per annum on undrawn amounts under the revolving credit agreement 
there was no amount drawn under the revolving credit agreement as of december   and the amounts above assume no amounts will be drawn during the agreement s term 
for more information on our credit facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were committed to approximately million for various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units 
total contractual obligations at december  also include approximately million for commitments relating to non capital items at greens creek 
includes scheduled capital lease payments of million and million including interest  respectively  for equipment at our greens creek and lucky friday units 
these leases have fixed payment terms and contain bargain purchase options at the end of the lease periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
on september   a consent decree settling the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims was entered by the us district court in idaho 
as of december   our remaining obligation under the terms of the settlement include i million in cash by october   ii million in cash by october   and iii approximately million by august  as quarterly payments of the proceeds from the exercise of any outstanding series and series warrants during the quarter  with the remaining balance  if any  due in august these payments are secured by a third party surety for which hecla limited pays an annual maintenance fee of of the remaining obligation balance 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our other defined benefit pension plans in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our liabilities for these matters totaled million  including for the net present value of hecla limited s liability relating to the coeur d alene river basin in north idaho 
on september  a consent decree settling the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims was entered by the us district court in idaho 
see the financial liquidity and capital resources section above for more information on the financial terms of the settlement 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures at our other sites are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will incur expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  mineral reserves  and accounting for business combinations  as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
metals prices are also an important component in the estimation of reserves 
as shown under part i  item a 
risk factors  metals prices have historically been volatile 
while average prices for all four metals we produce performed favorably for the five consecutive years prior to  there was a reduction in the average prices for zinc and lead in compared to  and average prices for silver  zinc and lead were lower in compared to average prices for all four metals rebounded in and were higher than their levels in both and  and average prices for all four metals were higher in compared to silver demand arises from investment demand  particularly in exchange traded funds  and industrial and consumer demand 
investment demand for silver and gold has been relatively strong over the past three years and is influenced by various factors  including the value of the us dollar and other currencies  expanding us budget deficits  widening availability of exchange traded commodity funds  interest rate levels  the health of credit markets  and inflationary expectations 
uncertainty towards a global economic recovery could result in continued investment demand for precious metals 
industrial demand for silver is closely linked to world gross domestic product growth and industrial fabrication levels  as it is difficult to substitute silver in industrial fabrication 
consumer demand is driven significantly by demand for jewelry and similar retail products 
we believe that global economic conditions are improving  though slowly and unevenly  and that industrial trends  including urbanization and growth of the middle class in countries such as china and india  will result in continued consumer and industrial demand growth for silver 
however  there can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or to how they will impact prices of the metals we produce 
we have recorded in the past impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices  and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  reserves  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine our depreciation rates  reserve estimates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
we examine the carrying values of our assets as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices  analyst price estimates  forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances  if any  on our deferred tax assets 
in addition  estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed between the time of shipment to the smelter and final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment 
as a result  our trade accounts receivable balances are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs 
for more information  see part n 
revenue recognition of note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilize financially settled forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for zinc and lead 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk management below for more information on our contract programs 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore marked to market though earnings each period 
changes in zinc and lead prices between the dates that the contracts are entered into and their settlements will result in changes to the fair value asset or liability associated with the contracts  with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in earnings 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
in the past we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements were not yet fully determined  nor had they been agreed to by us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities under appropriate accounting guidance  and on at least an annual basis more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the ranges of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings in the past have considerably exceeded the liabilities we had recognized and may do so in the future 
while the recent settlement of the basin litigation has resolved and fixed our largest and most significant environmental risk  other risks remain unresolved 
if substantial damages were awarded  claims were settled  or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 
reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately 
reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for acquisitions see business combinations below 
reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived assets  including estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves  as discussed above 
in some cases  we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  which  among other things  amended subtopic with respect to the presentation of other comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
the update amended subtopic so that a securities and exchange commission filer may present other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the filer is also required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented

forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis  as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby 
see the discussion in special note on forward looking statements included prior to part i  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable see part i  item a 
risk factors 
commodity price risk management at times  we may use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production  thereby partially offsetting our exposure to price fluctuations 
these instruments do  however  expose us to i credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties for contracts in which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity and ii price risk to the extent that the spot price exceeds the contract price for quantities of our production contained under contract positions 
in april  we began utilizing financially settled forward contracts to sell lead and zinc at fixed prices for settlement at approximately the same time that our unsettled concentrate sales contracts will settle 
the settlement of each concentrate lot is based on the average spot price of the metal during the month of settlement  which may differ from the prices used to record the sale when the sale takes place 
the objective of the contracts is to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings each period 
we recognized a million net gain on the contracts during  which is included in sales of products 
the net gains recognized on the contracts offset price adjustments on our provisional concentrate sales related to changes to lead and zinc prices between the time of sale and final settlement 
in addition  in may  we also began utilizing financially settled forward contracts to manage the exposure of changes in prices of zinc and lead contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments 
these contracts also do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings each period 
we recognized a million net gain on the contracts  net of million in losses realized on settled contracts during the net gains on these contracts are included as a separate line item under other income expense  as they relate to forecasted future shipments  as opposed to sales that have already taken place but are subject to final pricing 
the gains recognized during are the result of decreasing lead and zinc prices during the end of however  this program is designed to mitigate the impact of potential future declines in lead and zinc prices from the price levels established in the contracts see average price information below 
the following table summarizes the quantities of base metals committed under forward sales contracts at december  metric tonnes under contract average price per pound zinc lead zinc lead contracts on provisional sales settlements contracts on forecasted sales settlements settlements as further discussed in note of note to consolidated financial statements  production at the lucky friday mine will be temporarily suspended due to the requirement to remove loose material from the silver shaft 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we liquidated forward contracts related to forecasted lucky friday base metal sales for total net proceeds of million 
provisional sales sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfers to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed between shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control see item a risk factors a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for more information 
at december   metals contained in concentrates and exposed to future price changes totaled approximately million ounces of silver   ounces of gold   tons of zinc  and  tons of lead 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately million 
however  as noted in commodity price risk management above  in april we initiated a program designed to mitigate the risk of negative price adjustments with limited mark to market financially settled forward contracts for our zinc and lead sales
