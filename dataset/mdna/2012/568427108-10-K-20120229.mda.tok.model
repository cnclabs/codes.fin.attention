item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail consumers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floor plan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail consumers  providing our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to optimize operating results and reduce risk in the event of a downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly when deemed appropriate  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  monitoring the activities and financial condition of our dealers and of the third party floor plan lenders who finance our dealers inventories  maximizing stockholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to stockholders  and the repurchase of the company s common stock on the open market  and aligning the interests of our management and stockholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our historical and forecasted financial results  market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
during  industry retail sales declined slightly  continuing a trend that began in the fourth quarter of retail sales have continued to decline due to the financial crisis which began in late and the resulting recession  decline in residential real estate values  and the associated decline in consumer confidence 
in spite of consistently declining industry sales during the past six years  our sales increased significantly in due to our dealers desire to restock their inventory with current year models as well as their ability to purchase inventory due to the availability of financing from third party floor plan lenders 
during  our production and sales to dealers were comparable to retail sales by dealers  although dealer demand increased significantly towards the end of the retail selling season  as fuel prices moderated and consumer confidence improved 
as a result  we generated slightly higher net sales  as well as gross and operating profit in compared to at the end of  our dealer inventories were slightly higher than at the end of  but order backlog improved significantly  due to stronger sales at the end of the retail selling season and the level dealer orders placed during this time for several of our new models 
management will continue to monitor retail demand  dealer inventory levels and the availability of dealer and consumer financing for the purchase of our products 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  an increase from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
our market share increased across a broad size range  but was higher among the larger boats in our market 
we believe that our market share increase is the result of several larger models which have updated styling and features  and appeal to consumers who can afford more expensive boats 
we also note that market share declined among manufacturers who have undergone bankruptcy reorganization or other financial difficulty  in particular among manufacturers of smaller boats 
we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  but we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that net sales will increase moderately in compared to and that our operating results will improve 
this belief is based on indications that retail demand in recreational boating has stabilized and may be increasing  the fact that our dealer inventories are at more normalized historical levels  and that our order backlog has increased significantly 
indications from winter boat shows are that attendance and sales are consistently higher than in our operating results should improve due to higher volumes of boat sales and an improved gross margin from improved production efficiencies and cost absorption 
although we believe that retail sales will increase in  we believe that the increase will be modest due to slowly improving consumer confidence  continued high unemployment  and continued depressed real estate values 
we believe that these factors dampen consumers enthusiasm for the purchase of large discretionary goods such as pleasure boats 
in addition  fuel prices have increased during the first quarter of  and consumer credit remains tight 
over the long term  the financial crisis and the prolonged low returns on equity and fixed income investments may have long term effects on consumer behavior with regard to pleasure boating 
these conditions may force consumers to save more for retirement or delay retirement  both of which decrease the funds and time available for recreational boating 
in such a case  consumers who may be interested in boating as a recreational activity may purchase boats later in their lives  or may purchase smaller  less expensive boats 
over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have improved their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
in addition  the recreational boating industry began a promotional program a number of years ago which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts  as well as other activities designed to increase the potential consumer market for pleasure boats 
many manufacturers  including marine products  are participating in this program 
management believes that these efforts will benefit the industry and marine products 
as in past years  marine products enhanced the design of a number of boats for the model year which began around the beginning of july for the model year  marine products is emphasizing entry level models in its chaparral and robalo product lines  which we believe will appeal to value conscious boaters who want to buy a new boat  as well as first time boat buyers who are interested in a smaller investment in boat ownership 
we believe that these new products will increase our net sales and enhance our profitability by increasing our cost absorption because of production efficiencies 
we also believe that these models will increase our sales in market segments in which we would like to increase our market share  and will encourage consumers of these products to purchase larger  more expensive boats from us in the future 
our financial results in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  consumer confidence  the availability of credit to our dealers and consumers  fuel costs  the continued acceptance of our new products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials and key components 
we anticipate that the company will continue to be challenged by the effect of an uncertain level of consumer demand during the winter boat show and retail selling season

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by million or percent in compared to the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in the number of boats sold and more typical incentive costs as a percentage of net sales  partially offset by a percent decrease in the average gross selling price per boat 
unit sales among all models increased significantly compared to the prior year  as we operated at significantly higher production levels in response to an improved financing environment within our dealer network as well as stable retail demand for our products

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   million at december  and million at december  in addition  the aggregate of short term and long term marketable securities was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the twelve months ended december in thousands net cash provided by used for operating activities net cash used for provided by investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash provided by used for operating activities decreased by million in compared to this decrease is primarily the result of an income tax refund of million received in relating to losses offset slightly by an increase in earnings in  excluding the gain on benefit plan financing arrangement  compared to cash used for investing activities increased approximately million in compared to due to increased purchases of marketable securities in as a result of improved cash flows from operations 
cash used for financing activities increased only million in compared to cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to this increase is primarily the result of a significant increase in earnings in compared to and an income tax refund of million related to losses received in  partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements during this increase in working capital requirements was primarily related to the increase in inventory due to higher production levels and stocking of key components in response to higher demand and sales 
cash used for investing activities increased approximately million in compared to due to increased purchases of marketable securities in as a result of improved cash flows 
cash used for financing activities decreased million in compared to primarily due to a reduction in dividends paid per share during compared to coupled with lower excess tax benefits for share based payments and lower common share repurchases in the current year 
cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million for minor enhancements to certain manufacturing plants 
the company participates in a multiple employer retirement income plan  sponsored by rpc  inc rpc 
during the second quarter of  the company made a contribution of million to this plan in order to achieve the company s funding objective 
we expect that additional contributions to the retirement income plan of approximately million will be required in on january   the board of directors voted to reinstate the quarterly cash dividend of per share to common stockholders 
the company has agreements with two employees  which provide for a monthly payment to the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional  shares that the company may repurchase for a total aggregate authorization of  shares 
as of december   the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market under this program and there are  shares that remain available for repurchase 
the company did not repurchase any shares under this program during the company has entered into agreements with third party floor plan lenders where it has agreed  in the event of default by the dealer  to repurchase mpc boats repossessed from the dealer 
these arrangements are subject to maximum repurchase amounts and the associated risk is mitigated by the value of the boats repurchased 
as a result of dealer defaults  the company became contractually obligated to repurchase inventory for approximately million during there were no repurchases of dealer inventory during at december  and  there were no amounts payable to lenders related to repurchased inventory or repurchased boats remaining in inventory 
if additional dealers experience financial difficulty as a result of the current market conditions  the company may incur additional repurchase obligations under current programs or programs initiated in the future 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations due to floor plan lenders other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for warehouse space and various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
the company has agreements with various third party lenders where it guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
as of december   there are no payables outstanding to floor plan lenders 
additionally  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties was  as of december  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters 
fair value measurements the company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy level  or based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as level the company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as level for defined benefit plan assets classified as level  the values are computed using inputs such as cost  discounted future cash flows  independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculated by the fund and not publicly available 
in  the company transferred trading securities from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs because significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices were used to value these trading securities 
also in  due to market disruptions that led to decreased availability of quoted prices for identical assets  the company classified available for sale securities  consisting primarily of municipal bonds  from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various third party floor plan lenders whereby the company guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
the company s obligation under these guarantees becomes effective in the case of a default under the financing arrangement between the dealer and the third party lender 
the agreements typically provide for the return of all repossessed boats in new and unused condition subject to normal wear and tear  as defined  to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on those boats  up to certain contractually determined dollar limits which vary by lender 
during  the company became obligated to repurchase inventory at a cost of approximately million 
there were no repurchases of dealer inventory during management continues to monitor the risk of additional defaults and resulting repurchase obligation based primarily upon information provided by the third party floor plan lenders and to adjust the guarantee liability at the end of each reporting period based on information reasonably available at that time 
as of december   the company believes the fair value of its remaining guarantee liability is immaterial 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has an agreement with one of the floor plan lenders whereby the contractual repurchase limit is to not exceed percent of the amount of the average net receivables financed by the floor plan lender for dealers during the prior month period 
the company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation of approximately million  with various expiration and cancellation terms of less than one year  for an aggregate repurchase obligation with all financing institutions of approximately million as of december  although the company has these agreements with financial institutions  in certain situations  the company may decide for business reasons to repurchase boats in excess of these contractual amounts 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in  and  in the company s liability to rpc for these services as of december  and was approximately  in and  in the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the company s executive officers with the exception of one are employees of both the company and rpc 
the employee benefits agreement provides for  among other things  the company s employees to continue participating subsequent to the spin off in two rpc sponsored benefit plans  specifically  the defined contribution k plan and the defined benefit retirement income plan 
a group that includes the company s chairman of the board  r 
randall rollins and his brother gary w 
rollins  who is also director of the company  and certain companies under their control  controls in excess of fifty percent of the company s voting power 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although historically very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends and management estimates  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are primarily based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives recorded in net sales as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in  and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and the company s enforcement of those terms over time  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on several factors including the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent in  and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales decreased in compared to due primarily to favorable claims experience and the resulting change in management s estimate of warranties issued in prior years 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which the earnings and deductions are realized  variations in the relationship of tax exempt income or losses to income before taxes and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  the effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed 
the company considers future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
the company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates

this risk is managed through conservative policies to invest in high quality obligations 
marine products has performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis using a duration model over the near term with a percent change in interest rates 
marine products portfolio is not subject to material interest rate risk exposure based on this analysis

management s report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of marine products corporation the management of marine products corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 
marine products corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance  at a reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures  an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel 
this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any controls system 
a controls system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met 
also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls 
under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting  as of december  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
based on this evaluation  management s assessment is that marine products corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  the independent registered public accounting firm  grant thornton llp  has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting  included in this report on page s richard a

the company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
