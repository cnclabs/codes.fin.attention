we also believe that engaged associates will enhance efficient operation of our properties  resulting in improved financial results for our property owners 
sustained adherence to these principles is a basis for our brand reputation and is one of the principal factors behind the decisions by our diverse group of hotel owners and developers to invest in hyatt branded properties around the world

world class brands

global platform with compelling growth potential 
our existing global presence is widely distributed and we operate in of the most populous urban centers around the globe 
we believe that our existing hotels provide us with a strong platform from which to selectively pursue new growth opportunities in markets where we are under represented 
our dedicated global development executives in offices around the world apply their experience  judgment and knowledge to ensure that new hyatt branded hotels enhance preference for our brands 
an important aspect of our compelling growth potential is our strong brand presence in higher growth markets such as india  china  russia  the middle east and brazil 
the combination of our existing presence and brands  experienced development team  established third party relationships and significant access to capital provides us with a strong foundation for future growth and long term value creation 
deep culture and experienced management teams 
hyatt has a strong culture rooted in values that have supported our past success and form the foundation for our future 
the members of the hyatt family are united by shared values  a common mission and a common goal 
the associates at our properties are led by an experienced group of general managers 
for example  the general managers at our full service owned and managed hotels have an average tenure of more than years at hyatt 
regional and divisional management teams located around the world support our hotel general managers by providing corporate resources  mentorship and coaching  owner support and other 
table of contents assistance necessary to help them achieve their goals 
senior operating management has an average of years of experience in the industry 
our experienced executive management team sets overall policies for our company  supports our regional and divisional teams and our associates around the world  provides strategic direction and leads our global growth initiatives 
strong capital base and disciplined financial approach 
our approach is to maintain appropriate levels of financial leverage and liquidity through industry cycles and economic downturns 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion and available borrowing capacity of billion 
we believe that as a result of our balance sheet strength  we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities to develop or acquire properties and brands 
we adhere to a formal investment process in evaluating such opportunities with input from various groups within our global organization 
diverse exposure to hotel management  franchising  ownership and development 
we believe that our experience as a multi brand manager  franchisor  owner and developer of hotels makes us one of the best positioned hospitality companies in the world 
our mix of managed  franchised and owned hotels provides a broad and diverse base of revenues  profits and cash flows and gives us flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these three lines of business 
high quality owned hotels located in desirable markets 
as of december   we own and operate a high quality portfolio of owned properties and managed or franchised properties that are owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures  consisting of luxury and upper upscale full service and select service hotels in key markets 
our owned full service hotels are located primarily in key markets  including major business centers and leisure destinations with strong growth potential  such as chicago  london  new york  paris  san francisco  seoul and zurich 
our hospitality ventures include ownership interests in properties in mumbai and s o paulo 
a number of our owned hotels and hospitality venture properties are unique assets with high name recognition and a strong position in their local markets 
the acquisition of owned hotels from lodgeworks  lp and its private equity partners collectively  lodgeworks in further expanded hyatt full service and select service brands into new markets in the united states 
as a significant owner of hotel assets  we believe we are well positioned for a strengthening of demand as we expect earnings growth from owned properties to outpace growth in revenues at those properties due to the relatively high fixed cost structure of operating hotels 
this benefit can be achieved through increased earnings from our owned assets and through value realized from selected asset sales 
a track record of innovation 
successful innovation has been a hallmark of hyatt since its founding 
more than forty years ago  we opened the hyatt regency atlanta  which was the first ever large scale atrium lobby hotel 
this was both an architectural icon as well as a highly functional hotel property that provided us an entry into the large scale convention market 
we have recently added a dedicated innovation function with representation at the highest level of our organization to ensure we continue to use what we know about our guests to create the best guest experience for each of our brands 
we also have a long track record of creative approaches to food and beverage at our hotels throughout the world  which have led to highly profitable venues that create demand for our hotel properties  particularly in asian markets 
in addition  we successfully introduced new service models to the industry 
we launched our hyatt place brand in and our andaz brand in  each of which features a unique internally developed service model that eliminates a number of de personalized aspects of the hotel experience 
in  we launched hyatt house  a revitalized extended stay concept that was designed based on insights gained from guests who frequently utilize hotels in the extended stay segment 
our business strategy our goal is to be the most preferred brand in each customer segment that we serve for our associates  guests and owners 
in order to achieve this goal  we apply what we know about what our customers need and want and 
table of contents we deliver experiences that are valuable to them 
this understanding and focus informs our strategies for improving the performance of our existing hotels and expanding the presence of the hyatt brand in markets worldwide 
focus on improvement in the performance of existing hotels a key component of our strategy is to maximize revenues and manage costs at existing hotel properties 
we strive to enhance revenues by focusing on increasing our share of hotel stays by our existing guests and increasing the number of new guests we serve on a regular basis  with the ultimate goal of establishing and increasing guest loyalty to our brands 
we manage costs by setting performance goals for our hotel management teams that are tied to compensation  and granting our general managers operational autonomy 
we support these cost management efforts by assisting our general managers with tools and analytics provided by our regional and corporate offices and by compensating our hotel management teams based on property performance 
o emphasize associate engagement 
our brands are defined  in large part  by the authentic hospitality that our associates deliver to our guests 
we believe that while a great product is necessary for success  a service model that promotes genuine service for our guests and that is focused on their particular needs is the key to a sustainable long term advantage 
therefore  we strive to involve our associates in deciding how we serve our guests and identifying what we can do to improve guest satisfaction 
we rely on our hotel general managers to lead by example and foster associate engagement 
we believe that associate engagement results in higher levels of customer satisfaction and improves the performance of our properties 
to assist in this process  we aim to ensure that talented management teams are in place worldwide and reward those teams that achieve higher levels of employee engagement  guest satisfaction and hotel financial performance 
o increase share of hotel stays 
we intend to expand hyatt s share of hotel stays by continuously striving to provide genuine guest service and delivering value to our guests 
our existing customer base is diverse with different needs and preferences 
we aim to provide differentiated service and product offerings targeted at each customer segment within each of our brands  such as meeting planners and convention guests  leisure guests and business travelers  in order to satisfy our customers specific needs 
to provide our customers with the level of service and authentic hospitality that our customers have come to expect  we are committed to maintaining and renovating our properties over time 
our hyatt gold passport guest loyalty program is designed to attract new guests and to demonstrate our loyalty to our best guests 
in the year ended december   new membership enrollment in our hyatt gold passport program increased by compared to new members enrolled during gold passport members represented of total room nights for in the last two years  hyatt gold passport has been honored with the colloquy award for loyalty innovation in travel hospitality and with five awards from the frequent traveler awards  including best hotel elite program the americas and middle east asia oceania  and the loyalty leadership award 
in september  we and chase card services launched the hyatt card  a co branded visa credit card 
the hyatt card offers additional benefits to our guests by rewarding them with  among other benefits  two free nights at any hyatt hotel and hyatt gold passport points for hotel stays and other card purchases  and is another way to deepen our relationships with our guests and welcome new travelers to hyatt hotels 
o enhance operational efficiency 
we strive to align our staffing levels and expenses with demand without compromising our commitment to providing authentic hospitality and achieving high levels of guest satisfaction 
during periods of declining demand for hospitality products and services we adjust staffing  arrangements with third party service providers  vendor terms and arrangements and certain standards in order to reduce costs without significantly impacting quality 
as demand improves  we remain focused on actively managing expenses 
we incentivize and assist our hotel general managers as they proactively manage both the guest experience and the operating costs at their properties 

table of contents expanding our presence in attractive markets we intend to drive brand preference by expanding the presence of our brands in attractive markets worldwide 
we believe that the scale of our presence around the world is small relative to the recognition of our brands and our excellent reputation for service and  therefore  we have a unique opportunity to grow 
we believe that our mission  goal and values  together with the strength of our brands  the excellence of our people  our strong capital and asset base  and opportunities for expansion provide us with a platform for long term value creation 
o increase market presence 
we focus our expansion efforts on under penetrated markets where we already have an established presence and locations where our guests are traveling but where we do not have a presence 
we intend to expand our presence by increasing the number of hotels under hyatt brand affiliation  primarily by entering into new management and franchising agreements 
we believe our intense focus on each customer group that we serve and our understanding of how we can serve them in new locations will result in good growth 
we have made significant progress in expanding our presence through development of new hotels and conversion of existing hotels over the past few years 
in new york city for example  we opened two andaz properties in and we opened hyatt lex in with these three new hotels  the newly renovated grand hyatt new york and contract signings for additional properties in new york city  we expect to double our presence in new york city by with each property either newly built in the last two years or freshly renovated 
expansion in emerging markets like china and india is central to our international growth strategy as penetration into new secondary cities and resort destinations provides the company with the opportunity to drive preference for our brands 
as of december   there were approximately hyatt hotels open or under development in china in key markets such as beijing  hong kong  macau  shanghai and shenzhen 
continued expansion in india during brought the total number of hyatt hotels under development there to over properties 
o expand our select service presence 
we intend to establish and expand hyatt place and hyatt house  which we believe will support our overall growth and enhance the performance of all of our brands 
we intend to grow our select service presence through construction of new franchised properties by third party developers  conversion and renovation of existing non hyatt properties  and  in certain cases participation in the development of properties that would be managed by us 
during  we announced the acquisition of three woodfin suites hotels in california that will be rebranded as hyatt house hotels 
additionally  with the exception of one property that has been rebranded a hyatt hotel  all of the hotel sierra properties acquired from lodgeworks will be rebranded as hyatt house hotels 
these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our extended stay presence significantly in we have a dedicated select service development team  which as part of the lodgeworks transaction added key associates to provide added strength to future development 
we believe that the opportunity for properties that provide a select offering of services at a lower price point than full service hotel alternatives is particularly compelling in certain emerging markets  such as brazil  india  china and the middle east  where there is a large and growing middle class along with a meaningful number of local business travelers 
we have announced new management agreements for select service properties currently under development in china  costa rica  india  panama and saudi arabia 
o increase focus on franchising 
we intend to increase our franchised hotel presence  primarily in north america  for our select service brands and our hyatt and hyatt regency brands 
by increasing our focus on franchising  we believe that we will gain access to capital from developers and property owners that specifically target franchising business opportunities 
we have established an internal team dedicated to supporting our franchise owners and to driving the expansion of our franchised hotel presence 
we plan to expand existing relationships and develop new relationships with franchisees who demonstrate an ability to provide excellent customer service and maintain our brand standards 

table of contents o utilize our capital and asset base for targeted growth 
the combination of our significant liquidity and strong capital position coupled with our large  high quality asset base provides a unique platform to support our growth strategy 
we intend to use our liquidity and strong capital base along with the proceeds from selected asset dispositions to redeploy capital to opportunities that will allow us to strengthen our presence in key markets worldwide 
in order to maximize long term shareholder value we intend to selectively recycle hotel properties and use the proceeds to expand our presence in markets as described above under increase market presence and expand our select service presence 
the form of our capital deployment will vary depending on the opportunity  and we will assess and balance liquidity  value and strategic importance in each instance 
we also will continue to commit capital to fund the renovation of certain assets in our existing owned portfolio 
while we will selectively dispose of hotel properties  we expect to maintain significant ownership of hotel properties over time given our focus and expertise as an owner 
during  we acquired three woodfin suites properties and hotels and branding and management rights to an additional four hotels from lodgeworks 
in addition to these acquisitions  we continued to invest capital for development in  which saw the re opening of the hyatt regency new orleans  continued funding for the redevelopment of a resort in hawaii and an increase in our commitment in connection with the development of the park hyatt new york 
we also sold nine properties to newly formed hospitality ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we continue to manage or franchise each of these nine properties 
o pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances 
we expect to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of other brands or hospitality management or franchising companies as a part of our efforts to expand our presence 
these acquisitions may include hotel real estate 
we expect to focus on acquisitions that complement our ability to serve our existing customer base and enhance customer preference by providing a greater selection of locations  properties and services 
furthermore  we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties to strengthen our brand presence

this program generates substantial repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel nights and other rewards 
hyatt gold passport members earn points based on their spending at our properties or in connection with spending on the hyatt card 
hyatt gold passport points can be redeemed at all properties across our brands and can also be converted into airline miles with more than participating airlines 

table of contents the hyatt gold passport program is funded through a contribution from eligible revenues generated from hyatt gold passport members 
these funds are applied to reimburse hotels for room nights where guests redeem hyatt gold passport points and to pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives to support the program 
as of december   the hyatt gold passport program had over million members  and during  hyatt gold passport members represented of total room nights 
competition there is intense competition in all areas of the hospitality industry in which we operate 
competition exists for hotel guests  management agreements and franchise agreements and sales of vacation ownership properties and branded residential properties 
our principal competitors are other operators of full service  select service and extended stay properties  including other major hospitality chains with well established and recognized brands 
we also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators 
we compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation  location  customer satisfaction  room rates  quality of service  amenities  quality of accommodations  security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 
we compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services  our brand name recognition and reputation  our ability and willingness to invest our capital in third party owned or hospitality venture projects  the level of our management fees and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name 
we compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation  the room rate that can be realized and total revenues we can deliver to the properties 
other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements include relationships with property owners and investors  including institutional owners of multiple properties  marketing support  reservation and e commerce system capacity and efficiency and the ability to make investments that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements 
we compete for sales of our vacation ownership properties based principally on location  quality of accommodations  price  financing terms  quality of service  flexibility of usage  opportunity to exchange into other vacation properties and brand name recognition and reputation 
in addition to competing with other hotel and resort properties  our vacation ownership properties compete with national and independent vacation ownership club operators as well as with owners reselling their interests in these properties 
our ability to attract and retain purchasers of our vacation ownership properties depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our vacation ownership products and services from those offered by others 
the universe of branded lodging operators with a global reach and depth of product and offerings similar to us is limited 
we believe that our strong customer base  prominent brand recognition  strategic property locations and global development team will enable us to compete effectively 
for additional information  see part i  item a  risk factors risks related to our business because we operate in a highly competitive industry  our revenues  profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 
seasonality the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature 
the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property  depending principally upon location and the customer base served 
based upon historical results  our north american properties typically generate the highest revenues in the second quarter and our international properties generally generate the highest revenues during the fourth quarter of each year 
we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

table of contents cyclicality the hospitality industry is cyclical and generally follows  on a lagged basis  the general economy 
there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms  in occupancy levels and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles 
variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given categories of hotels 
the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties 
the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable 
because of this  in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues 
conversely  in an environment of increasing demand and room rates  the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues 
the vacation ownership business is also cyclical 
the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market 
intellectual property in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate  trademarks  service marks  trade names and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our hotels  residential and vacation ownership properties and services 
we have a significant number of trademarks  service marks  trade names  logos and pending registrations  and significant resources are expended each year on surveillance  registration and protection of our trademarks  service marks  trade names and logos  which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 
government regulation we are subject to numerous foreign  federal  state and local government laws and regulations  including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages  building and zoning requirements  data privacy and general business license and permit requirements  in the various jurisdictions in which we manage  franchise and own hotels 
our ability to develop new hotel properties and to remodel  refurbish or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities 
we are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions  hiring and firing  non discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics  work permits and benefit offerings 
federal  state and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration  disclosure statements  compliance with specific standards of conduct and other practices with respect to the franchising of hotels 
additionally  the vacation ownership properties we operate are subject to local  state and federal requirements regarding the licensing of sales agents  compliance of marketing materials and numerous other requirements regarding the sale and management of vacation ownership properties 
compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of properties managed  franchised or owned and of our vacation ownership business and could adversely affect our operations 
we believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels 
however  with the exception of the hyatt regency aruba resort and casino  third parties manage and operate the casinos 
we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casino located at the hyatt regency aruba resort and casino and employ third party compliance consultants and service providers 
as a result  our business operations at the hyatt regency aruba resort and casino are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the departamento pa asuntonan di casino dac  the regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in aruba 
the gaming operations at the hyatt regency aruba resort and casino have been regulated by the nevada gaming commission and the nevada state gaming control board because a former provider of services at the hyatt regency aruba resort and casino  whose agreement with us terminated in the third quarter of  also operates casinos in nevada 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately  employees at our corporate offices  divisional offices  owned and managed hotels and residential and vacation ownership properties 
approximately of those employees were either represented by a labor union or had terms of employment that were determined under a labor agreement 
some of our more than  associates are employed by certain third party owners and franchisees of our hotels and are not included in the  figure above because we do not directly employ them 
we believe relations with our employees and associates are good 
environmental matters in connection with our ownership and management of hotels and development of other real properties  we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection 
under some of these laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances or wastes on  under or in such real property  as well as third party sites where the owner or operator sent wastes for disposal 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew  or was at fault in connection with  the presence or release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
furthermore  a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another  or who transports such substance to or from such property  may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility 
although we are not aware of any current material obligations for investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes at our owned properties  the future discovery of substances or wastes at any of our owned properties  or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly  could adversely affect our ability to develop or sell such real estate  or to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
in addition  the costs of investigating or remediating contamination  at our properties or at properties where we sent substances or wastes for disposal  may be substantial 
we are also subject to various requirements  including those contained in environmental permits required for our operations  governing air emissions  effluent discharges  the use  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and health and safety 
from time to time  we may be required to manage  abate or remove mold  lead or asbestos containing materials at our properties 
we believe that our properties and operations are in compliance  in all material respects  with all foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and ordinances 
however  additional operating costs and capital expenditures could be incurred if additional or more stringent requirements are enacted in the future 
insurance our owned  managed and franchised hotels are insured under different insurance programs depending on participation in our insurance programs or participation in our owner or franchisee insurance programs 
hotels owned by the company have insurance coverage that we maintain under our insurance programs for liability  property  workers compensation and other risks with respect to our business 
our liability insurance provides coverage for most claims  including terrorism  resulting from our operations  goods and services and automobiles 
our property insurance provides coverage for all risks to our properties including fire  windstorm  flood  earthquake and terrorism 
property insurance also includes business interruption coverage 
our workers compensation insurance provides coverage for employee injuries in the course and scope of employment 
hotels managed by the company are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners 
the majority of our managed hotels participate in our insurance programs 
our management agreements require managed hotels that do not participate in our insurance programs to be insured at coverage levels generally consistent with the coverage levels under our insurance programs  including liability  property  business interruption  workers compensation and other insurance 
we are typically covered under these insurance policies to the extent necessary and reasonable 
our franchise agreements require our franchisees to maintain liability  property  business interruption  workers compensation and other insurance at our franchised hotels 
we 
table of contents are typically covered under these insurance policies to the extent necessary and reasonable 
we believe our insurance policies and those maintained by others related to our managed and franchised hotels that do not participate in our insurance programs are adequate for foreseeable losses and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary with solvent insurance carriers

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report  you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to the hospitality industry the hospitality industry is cyclical  and macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our hospitality products and services 
the hospitality industry is cyclical 
for example  the last two completed business cycles in the hospitality industry  which we define as the period starting with the first calendar year of negative revenue per available room revpar growth and ending with the last calendar year of positive revpar growth  took place from to and to during the declining stages of these two business cycles  revpar growth was negative for one calendar year and two calendar years and  respectively 
the declining stage of the current business cycle began in the fourth quarter of and continued until the second quarter of our revpar declines in the current business cycle were more severe than those of the last two business cycles  and have had a greater negative impact on our profitability 
see a worsening of global economic conditions could cause our revenues and profitability to decline and part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations principal factors affecting our results of operations revenue 

table of contents macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services  including demand for rooms at properties that we manage  franchise  own and develop and for sales of vacation ownership properties 
these factors include changes and volatility in general economic conditions  including the severity and duration of any downturn in the us  europe or global economy and financial markets  war  civil unrest cairo  egypt  terrorist activities such as the terrorist attacks in jakarta  indonesia and mumbai  india or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events  outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases  such as avian flu  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and hn swine flu  natural or man made disasters  such as earthquakes  tsunamis  tornados  hurricanes  floods  oil spills and nuclear incidents  changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers  decreased corporate budgets and spending and cancellations  deferrals or renegotiations of group business eg  industry conventions  low consumer confidence and high levels of unemployment  depressed housing prices  the financial condition of the airline  automotive and other transportation related industries and its impact on travel  decreased airline capacities and routes  travel related accidents  oil prices and travel costs  statements  actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel related activities  and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities  domestic and international political and geo political conditions  cyclical over building in the hotel and vacation ownership industries  and organized labor activities  which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of group business 
these factors can adversely affect  and from time to time have adversely affected  individual properties  particular regions or our business as a whole 
how we manage any one or more of these factors  or any crisis  could limit or reduce demand  or the rates our properties are able to charge for rooms or services or the prices at which we are able to sell our vacation ownership properties  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a worsening of global economic conditions could cause our revenues and profitability to decline 
consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels 
declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions  risks affecting or reducing travel patterns  lower consumer confidence and high unemployment or adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned properties and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties 
declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees  which is based on hotel profit measures 
outside of the united states  our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures  either through a single management fee that is based on a profitability measure  or because our two tier fee structure is more heavily 
table of contents weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee 
because revpar is a measure of achieved average daily rate adr and occupancy  declines in adr and occupancy relating to declines in consumer demand will lower revpar 
for additional information regarding revpar and adr  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations key business metrics evaluated by management 
our vacation ownership business is also linked to cycles in the general economy and consumer discretionary spending 
as a result  changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility 
global economic downturns have historically led to a significant decline in demand for hospitality products and services  lower occupancy levels and significantly reduced room rates  all of which has lowered our revenues and negatively affected our profitability 
for example  our revenues decreased by million driven by an decline in revpar at comparable systemwide properties in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations principal factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
the global economic downturn and the general uncertainty over the duration of such conditions in key global markets could continue to have a negative impact on the hospitality industry 
imminent improvements in demand for hospitality products and services in key global markets may not occur  and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if recovery stalls or conditions worsen 
while our and results reflect an increase in revpar levels at comparable systemwide properties  they have not increased at the same rate at which they declined 
uncertainty regarding the rate and pace of further recovery and the impact any such recovery may have on different regions of the world makes it difficult to predict further increases in revpar levels 
additionally  if economic weakness were to return to any of these regions of the world  it could have an adverse impact on our revenues and negatively affect our profitability 
we are subject to the business  financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry  any of which could reduce our profits and limit our opportunities for growth 
our business is subject to a number of business  financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry  including changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages  prices  interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs  the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations  the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs  the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and potential hotel owners to fund investments  capital expenditures and service debt obligations  delays in or cancellations of planned or future development projects  foreign exchange rate fluctuations or restructurings  changes in operating costs  including  but not limited to  energy  food  workers compensation  benefits  insurance and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events  significant increases in cost for healthcare coverage for employees and potential government regulation in respect of health coverage  shortages of labor or labor disruptions  shortages of desirable locations for development  the financial condition of third party property owners  franchisees  developers and hospitality venture partners  which may impact our ability to recover payments owed to us or such third parties ability to fund operational costs  perform under management  franchise  development and hospitality venture agreements or satisfy other contractual commitments and obligations that may impact us  
table of contents relationships with our third party property owners  franchisees and hospitality venture partners  and the ability of third party internet travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers 
any of these factors could limit or reduce the prices we charge for our hospitality products or services  including the rates our properties charge for rooms or the prices for which we are able to sell our vacation ownership properties 
these factors can also increase our costs or affect our ability to develop new properties or maintain and operate our existing properties 
as a result  any of these factors can reduce our profits and limit our opportunities for growth 
risks related to our business because we operate in a highly competitive industry  our revenues  profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 
the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition 
our principal competitors are other operators of full service and select service properties  including other major hospitality chains with well established and recognized brands 
we also compete against smaller hotel chains and independent and local hotel owners and operators 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our revenues or profits may decline or our ability to maintain or increase our market share may be diminished 
competition for guests we compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation  location  customer satisfaction  room rates  quality of service  amenities  quality of accommodations  security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points 
some of our competitors are larger than we are based on the number of properties or rooms they manage  franchise or own or based on the number of geographic locations where they operate 
some of our competitors also have significantly more members participating in their guest loyalty programs which may enable them to attract more customers and more effectively retain such guests 
our competitors may also have greater financial and marketing resources than we do  which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively 
in addition  industry consolidation may exacerbate these risks 
competition for management and franchise agreements we compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services  our brand name recognition and reputation  our ability and willingness to invest our capital in third party owned or hospitality venture projects  the level of our management fees  the terms of our management agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name 
we compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation  the room rate that can be realized and royalty fees charged 
other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements include relationships with property owners and investors  including institutional owners of multiple properties  marketing support  reservation and e commerce system capacity and efficiency and the ability to make investments that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements 
we believe that our ability to compete for management and franchise agreements primarily depends on the success of the properties that we currently manage or franchise 
the terms of any new management or franchise agreements that we obtain also depend on the terms that our competitors offer for those agreements 
in addition  if the availability of suitable locations for new properties decreases  planning or other local regulations change or the availability or affordability of financing is limited  the supply of suitable properties for us to manage or franchise could be diminished 
we may also be required to agree to limitations on the expansion of one or more of our brands in certain geographic areas in order to obtain a management or franchise agreement for a property under development 
we may be prohibited from managing  franchising or owning properties in areas where 
table of contents opportunities exist due to these restrictions 
if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors  if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited  our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 
competition for sales of vacation ownership properties we compete for sales of our vacation ownership properties based principally on location  quality of accommodations  price  financing terms  quality of service  terms of property use  opportunity to exchange into time at other vacation properties and brand name recognition and reputation 
in addition to competing with other hotel and resort properties  our vacation ownership properties compete with national and independent vacation ownership club operators as well as with owners reselling their interests in these properties 
our ability to attract and retain qualified purchasers of our vacation ownership properties depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our vacation ownership products and services from those offered by others 
if we are unable to do so  our ability to compete effectively for sales of vacation ownership properties could be adversely affected 
if third party property owners or franchisees of the properties we manage or franchise fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties  preference for our brands and our reputation could suffer or our management or franchise agreements with those parties could terminate 
we manage and franchise properties owned by third parties under the terms of management and franchise agreements 
substantially all of these agreements require third party property owners to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining our brand integrity and reputation 
we depend on third party property owners to comply with these requirements by maintaining and improving properties through investments  including investments in furniture  fixtures  amenities and personnel 
third party property owners or franchisees may be unable to access capital or unwilling to spend available capital when necessary  even if required by the terms of our management or franchise agreements 
if our third party property owners or franchisees fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties we manage or franchise  our brand preference and reputation could suffer 
moreover  third party owners or franchisees may be unwilling or unable to incur the cost of complying with brand standards for new and existing brands as such brands may evolve from time to time 
as a result  we may be forced to absorb such costs to ensure that brand standards come to market in a timely fashion 
in addition  if third party property owners or franchisees breach the terms of our agreements with them  we may elect to exercise our termination rights  which would eliminate our revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these relationships 
these risks become more pronounced during economic downturns 
if our management or franchise agreements terminate prematurely or we elect to make cure payments due to failures to meet performance tests  at the request of third parties or upon the occurrence of other stated events  our revenues could decrease and our costs could increase 
our management and franchise agreements may terminate prematurely in certain cases 
some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to owners of the hotels we manage upon the occurrence of a stated event  such as the sale of the hotel or our failure to meet a specified performance test 
generally  termination rights under performance tests are based upon the property s individual performance  its performance when compared to a specified set of competitive hotels branded by other hotel operators  or both 
some agreements require a failure of one test  and other agreements require a failure of more than one test  before termination rights are triggered 
these termination rights are usually triggered if we do not meet the performance tests over multiple years 
generally  we have the option to cure performance failures by making an agreed upon cure payment 
however  our cure rights may be limited in some cases and the failure to meet the performance tests may result in the termination of our management agreement 
in the past we have failed 
table of contents performance tests  received notices of termination and elected to make cure payments and failed performance tests and negotiated an alternative resolution 
when any termination notice is received  we evaluate all relevant facts and circumstances at the time in deciding whether to cure 
in addition  some of our management agreements give third party property owners the right to terminate upon payment of a termination fee to us after a certain period of time or upon sale of the property or another stated event 
our franchise agreements typically require franchisees to pay a fee to us before terminating 
in addition  if an owner files for bankruptcy  our management and franchise agreements may be terminable under applicable law 
if a management or franchise agreement terminates  we could lose the revenues we derive from that agreement or incur costs related to ending our relationship with the third party and exiting the property 
if we are unable to maintain good relationships with third party property owners and franchisees  our revenues could decrease and we may be unable to expand our presence 
we earn fees for managing and franchising hotels and other properties 
the viability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with third party property owners and franchisees 
third party developers  property owners and franchisees are focused on maximizing the value of their investment and working with a management company or franchisor that can help them be successful 
the effectiveness of our management  the value of our brands and the rapport that we maintain with our third party property owners and franchisees impact renewals and are all important factors for new third party property owners or franchisees considering doing business with us 
our relationships with these third parties generate additional property development opportunities that support our growth 
if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our third party property owners and franchisees  we may be unable to renew existing agreements or expand our relationships with these owners 
additionally  our opportunities for developing new relationships with additional third parties may be adversely impacted 
contractual and other disagreements with third party property owners or franchisees could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses  which could lower our profits 
our management and franchise agreements require us and third party property owners or franchisees to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements 
additionally  some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third party hotel properties such as us  which means  among other things  that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination 
in the event of any such termination  we may need to negotiate or enforce our right to damages that may not equal expected profitability over the term of the agreement 
we generally seek to resolve any disagreements with our third party property owners or franchisees amicably 
formal dispute resolution occurs through arbitration  if provided under the applicable management or franchise agreement  or through litigation 
we cannot predict the outcome of any such arbitration or litigation  the effect of any adverse judgment of a court or arbitrator against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party 
we are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate  which could increase our costs  reduce our profits  limit our ability to respond to market conditions or restrict our growth strategy 
our proportion of owned properties  as compared to the number of properties that we manage or franchise for third party owners  is larger than that of some of our competitors 
real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties  including governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership  
table of contents real estate  insurance  zoning  tax  environmental and eminent domain laws  the ongoing need for owner funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties  risks associated with mortgage debt  including the possibility of default  fluctuating interest rate levels and the availability of replacement financing  fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets  and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets 
the negative impact on profitability and cash flow generation from a decline in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we  as the owner  bear the risk of their high fixed cost structure 
the need to maintain and renovate owned properties can present challenges  especially when cash generated from operations has declined 
the effectiveness of any cost cutting efforts is limited by the fixed cost nature of our business 
as a result  we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting  which could further reduce our margins 
during times of economic distress  declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values 
in an unfavorable market  we may not be able to sell properties in the short term 
accordingly  we may not be able to adjust our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
in addition  because our strategy to use proceeds from sales of real property to support our growth depends in part on our ability to sell selected properties  any inability to do so could impair our growth strategy 
economic and other conditions may adversely impact the valuation of our assets resulting in impairment charges that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings 
we hold significant amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and equity method investments 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assets for impairment based on various triggers  including actual operating losses and trends of expected demand and profitability  as described in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
these evaluations have  in the past  resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets 
our operating results for the years ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of total net impairment charges attributable to hyatt hotels corporation  related primarily to our interests in unconsolidated hospitality ventures  vacation ownership properties and certain owned hotels 
we may incur additional impairment charges  which could be material and negatively affect our results of operations and earnings 
we have a limited ability to manage third party risks associated with our hospitality venture investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our costs  lower our profits and increase our liabilities 
we participate in hospitality ventures with third parties 
in the future  we may also buy and develop properties in hospitality ventures with the sellers of the properties  affiliates of the sellers  developers or other third parties 
our hospitality venture partners may have shared or majority control over the operations of our hospitality ventures 
as a result  our investments in hospitality ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in investing in real estate independently 
these risks include the possibility that our hospitality ventures or our partners go bankrupt or otherwise are unable to meet their capital contribution obligations  have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals  are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions  our requests  our policies  our objectives or applicable laws  
table of contents subject the property to liabilities exceeding those contemplated  take actions that reduce our return on investment  or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business 
for these and other reasons  it could be more difficult for us to sell our interest in any hospitality venture or to pursue the venture s activities  which could reduce our ability to address any problems we may have with those properties or respond to market conditions in the future and could lead to impairments of such ventures 
as a result  our investments in hospitality ventures could lead to impasses with our partners or situations that could harm the hospitality venture  which could reduce our revenues  increase our costs and lower our profits 
in addition  in conjunction with financing obtained for our unconsolidated hospitality ventures  we may provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss  liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the other hospitality venture owners 
if our hospitality ventures fail to provide information that is required to be included in our financial statements  we may be unable to accurately report our financial results 
preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of our hospitality ventures 
any deficiencies in our hospitality ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud 
such deficiencies could also result in restatements of  or other adjustments to  our previously reported or announced operating results  which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares 
additionally  if our hospitality ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines  we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports 
cash distributions from our hospitality ventures could be limited by factors outside our control that could reduce our return on investment and our ability to generate liquidity from these hospitality ventures 
although our hospitality ventures may generate positive cash flow  in some cases these hospitality ventures may be unable to distribute that cash to the hospitality venture partners 
additionally  in some cases our hospitality venture partners control distributions  and may choose to leave capital in the hospitality venture rather than distribute it 
because our ability to generate liquidity from our hospitality ventures depends on the hospitality ventures ability to distribute capital to us  tax restrictions or decisions of our hospitality venture partners could reduce our return on these investments 
we include our pro rata share of adjusted ebitda attributable to our unconsolidated hospitality ventures in our owned and leased hotels segment adjusted ebitda and our consolidated adjusted ebitda regardless of whether the cash flow of those ventures is  or can be  distributed to us 
we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties  or through alliances  and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets  any of which may be unsuccessful or divert our management s attention 
we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses  properties  brands or other assets 
furthermore  we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties 
in many cases  we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
acquisitions or investments in businesses  properties  brands or assets  as well as these alliances  are subject to risks that could affect our business  including risks related to issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  spending cash and incurring debt  
table of contents assuming contingent liabilities  contributing properties or related assets to hospitality ventures that could result in recognition of losses  or creating additional expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions  investments or alliances 
there may be high barriers to entry in many key markets and scarcity of available development and investment opportunities 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all  or that the ability to obtain financing will not be restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility or other indebtedness we may incur 
the success of any such acquisitions or investments will also depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 
we may experience difficulty with integrating acquired businesses  properties or other assets  including difficulties relating to coordinating sales  distribution and marketing functions  integrating technology information systems  and preserving the important licensing  distribution  marketing  customer  labor and other relationships of the acquired assets 
in  we acquired from lodgeworks hotels  branding and management rights to an additional four hotels and other assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired assets with our existing operations or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from this acquisition 
divestment of some of our properties or assets may yield returns below our investment criteria 
in some circumstances  sales of properties or other assets may result in losses 
in addition  any such acquisitions  investments  dispositions or alliances could demand significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for our regular business operations  which could harm our business 
we may not be successful in executing our strategy of disposing of selected assets  which could hinder our ability to expand our presence in markets that will enhance and expand our brand preference 
we regularly review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe are in markets or of a property type that may not benefit us as much as other markets or property types 
one of our strategies is to selectively dispose of hotel properties and use sale proceeds to fund our growth in markets that will enhance and expand our brand presence 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such sales on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such sales 
dispositions of real estate assets are particularly difficult in the current economic environment  as financing alternatives are limited for potential buyers 
the current economic environment and the credit crisis adversely affected the real estate market and caused a reduction in sales of hotel properties 
our inability to sell assets  or to sell such assets at attractive prices  could have an adverse impact on our ability to realize proceeds for reinvestment and hinder our ability to expand our business 
in addition  even if we are successful in consummating sales of selected properties  such dispositions may yield returns below our investment criteria and result in losses  which could negatively affect operating results for the period in which such sales occur 
moreover  from time to time  we may market and evaluate the potential sale of non strategic assets without committing to the consummation of such sale for various reasons  including a lack of acceptable purchasers  undesirable market conditions or other factors 
our affirmative decision not to proceed with any such sale transaction may be perceived as an inability to execute our strategy 

table of contents timing  budgeting and other risks could delay our efforts to develop  redevelop or renovate the properties that we own  or vacation ownership developments that we undertake  or make these activities more expensive  which could reduce our profits or impair our ability to compete effectively 
we must maintain and renovate the properties that we own in order to remain competitive  maintain the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we also selectively undertake ground up construction of properties and vacation ownership developments which may span multiple phases and often take years to complete 
often these projects include joint venture partners 
these efforts are subject to a number of risks  including construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials that may increase project costs  obtaining zoning  occupancy and other required permits or authorizations  changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns  governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development  force majeure events  including earthquakes  tornados  hurricanes  floods or tsunamis  and design defects that could increase costs 
developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before the properties can begin to operate 
if the cost of funding these developments or renovations exceeds budgeted amounts  profits could be reduced 
further  due to the lengthy development cycle  adverse economic conditions may alter or impede our development plans  thereby resulting in incremental costs to us or potential impairment charges 
moreover  during the early stages of operations  charges related to interest expense and depreciation may substantially detract from  or even outweigh  the profitability of certain new property investments 
similarly  the timing of capital improvements can affect property performance  including occupancy and average daily rate  particularly if we need to close a significant number of rooms or other facilities  such as ballrooms  meeting spaces or restaurants 
for example  we recently completed broad scope renovation projects at five owned properties 
the displacement caused by these renovations negatively impacted owned and leased segment results for the third and fourth quarter of  and the first  second and third quarters of moreover  the investments that we make may fail to improve the performance of the properties in the manner that we expect 
if we are not able to begin operating properties under development or renovation as scheduled  or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance  our ability to compete effectively could be diminished and our revenues could be reduced 
if our third party property owners  including our hospitality venture partners  are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties  our revenues  profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 
many of the properties that our third party property owners and our hospitality venture partners own are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into when such properties were purchased or refinanced 
if our third party property owners or our hospitality venture partners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all  the lenders could declare a default  accelerate the related debt and repossess the property 
in the current economic environment  a number of property owners are experiencing financial difficulties and the properties they own are vulnerable to financial stress 
debt defaults could lead third party property owners or our hospitality venture partners to sell the property on unfavorable terms or  in the case of secured debt  to convey the mortgaged property to the lender 
for example  during the second quarter of  
table of contents the consolidated venture that owned the hyatt regency princeton did not have sufficient cash flow to meet debt service requirements under its mortgage loan 
the assets and operations of the hyatt regency princeton secured this mortgage 
in september  the ownership interest in the hyatt regency princeton was transferred to its lender through a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction 
the hotel continues to be operated as a hyatt branded hotel 
any similar sales or repossessions could  in certain cases  result in the termination of our management agreements or eliminate any anticipated income and cash flows from  and  if applicable  our invested capital in  such property  which could harm our business 
if we or our third party owners  franchisees or development partners are unable to access the capital necessary to fund current operations or implement our plans for growth  our profits could be reduced and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished 
the hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant capital expenditures to develop  operate  maintain and renovate properties 
access to the capital that we or our third party owners  franchisees or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues 
the availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third party owners  franchisees or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level  cost and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues 
the most recent economic downturn caused credit markets to experience significant disruption severely reducing liquidity and credit availability 
such disruptions may diminish the ability and desire of existing and potential development partners to access capital necessary to develop properties 
our ability to access additional capital could also be limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility  which restricts our ability to incur debt under certain circumstances 
additionally  if one or more of the financial institutions that support our revolving credit facility fails  we may not be able to find a replacement  which would reduce the availability of funds that we can borrow under the facility 
if we are forced to spend larger amounts of cash from operating activities than anticipated to operate  maintain or renovate existing properties  then our ability to use cash for other purposes  including acquisition or development of properties  could be limited and our profits could be reduced 
similarly  if we cannot access the capital we need to fund our operations or implement our growth strategy  we may need to postpone or cancel planned renovations or developments  which could impair our ability to compete effectively and harm our business 
if we fail to meet performance standards under a contractual performance obligation  our profits could be reduced 
in connection with the acquisition of the amerisuites brand in  we assumed obligations under a management agreement with a third party owner of multiple properties to make payments based on specified thresholds for those properties 
as a result of the removal of rooms from inventory during renovation of the subject properties upon conversion to the hyatt place brand and due to the decline in demand for lodging products and services as a result of the economic downturn  we are obligated to make payments in certain circumstances under this agreement up to a maximum of million of which million has been paid over the life of the agreement through december  
these payments could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows 
if we become liable for losses related to loans we have provided or guaranteed to third parties  our profits could be reduced 
at times  we make loans for hotel development expenditures when we enter into management or franchise agreements with third parties  including hospitality ventures 
in certain circumstances we may also provide senior 
table of contents secured financing or subordinated forms of financing also referred to as mezzanine financing to third party owners 
for example  in  we made a million loan to an unconsolidated hospitality venture in order to finance its purchase of the hyatt regency waikiki beach resort and spa 
we could suffer losses if third party property owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide 
in we wrote off a million mezzanine loan that was fully reserved for in to secure financing for six of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures  we have provided to third party lenders financial guarantees related to the timely repayment of all or a portion of the associated debt 
the guarantees are limited to our share of the underlying obligation 
as of december   our maximum contingent liability was million 
if we are liable for losses related to loans we have provided or guaranteed to third parties  our costs could increase and our profits could fall 
in any particular period  our expenses may not decrease at the same rate that our revenues may decrease  which could have an adverse effect on our net cash flows  margins and profits 
many of the expenses associated with managing  franchising or owning hotels and residential and vacation ownership properties are relatively fixed 
these expenses include personnel costs  interest  rent  property taxes  insurance  and utilities 
if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases  the decline in our revenues could have a particularly adverse impact on our net cash flows and profits 
this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth  such as the recent economic recession 
economic downturns generally affect the results derived from owned property more significantly than those derived by managers and franchisors given the greater exposure that the owners have to the properties performance 
during the recent economic downturn  our revenues declined at a greater rate than our costs 
for example  during the year ended december   our consolidated revenues declined by while our direct and selling  general and administrative expenses declined by  compared to the same period in during the year ended december   the revenues of our owned and leased hotels declined by  while corresponding owned and leased hotel expenses declined by  compared to the same period in where cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues  we could experience a material decline in margins and potentially negative cash flows 
if we are unable to establish and maintain key distribution arrangements for our properties  the demand for our rooms and our revenues could fall 
some of the rooms at hotels and resorts that we manage  franchise or own are booked through third party internet travel intermediaries and online travel service providers 
we also engage third party intermediaries  including travel agencies and meeting and event management companies  who collect fees by charging our hotels and resorts a commission on room revenues 
a failure by our distributors to attract or retain their customer bases could lower demand for hotel rooms and  in turn  reduce our revenues 

table of contents if bookings by these third party intermediaries increase  these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or other significant contract concessions from us  increasing the overall cost of these third party distribution channels 
some of our distribution agreements are not exclusive  have a short term  are terminable at will  or are subject to early termination provisions 
the loss of distributors  increased distribution costs  or the renewal of distribution agreements on significantly less favorable terms could adversely impact our business 
if the volume of sales made through third party internet travel intermediaries increases significantly  consumer loyalty to our brand could decrease and our revenues could fall 
we expect to derive most of our business from traditional channels of distribution and our website 
however  consumers now use internet travel intermediaries regularly 
some of these intermediaries are attempting to increase the importance of generic quality indicators such as four star downtown hotel at the expense of brand identification 
these agencies hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservation system rather than to our brands 
if the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands  our business and revenues could be harmed 
in addition  we have recently co founded hotel jv services  llc  which does business as roomkey 
com  a third party website offering a metasearch engine for hotel rooms that allows customers to book rooms directly with a wide variety of suppliers 
we cannot assure you that this venture will either positively impact our business or effectively compete with third party internet travel intermediaries 
if we are not able to develop new initiatives  including new brands  successfully  our business and profitability could be harmed 
we often develop and launch new initiatives  including new brands or marketing programs  which can be a time consuming and expensive process 
for example  in we launched our andaz brand  and in we began rebranding our hyatt summerfield suites extended stay brand to hyatt house 
we have invested capital and resources in owned real estate  property development  brand development and brand promotion 
if such initiatives are not well received by our associates  guests and owners  they may not have the intended effect 
we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing andaz  launching hyatt house or other initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits  which could lower our profits 
labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce our profits 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain  train  manage and engage our associates 
our properties are staffed hours a day  seven days a week by thousands of associates around the world 
if we and our franchisees are unable to attract  retain  train and engage skilled associates  our ability to manage and staff our properties adequately could be impaired  which could reduce customer satisfaction 
staffing shortages could also hinder our ability to grow and expand our business 
because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our properties  a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase our labor costs  which could reduce our profits and the profits of our third party owners 
negotiations of collective bargaining agreements  attempts by labor organizations to organize additional groups of our associates or changes in labor laws could disrupt our operations  increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 
certain of our properties are subject to collective bargaining agreements  similar agreements or regulations enforced by governmental authorities 
if relationships with our associates  other field personnel or the unions that represent them become adverse  the properties we manage  franchise or own could experience labor disruptions such as strikes  lockouts and public demonstrations 
labor disruptions  which are generally more likely when 
table of contents collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated  could harm our relationship with our associates or cause us to lose guests 
further  adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services 
labor regulation could lead to higher wage and benefit costs  changes in work rules that raise operating expenses  legal costs  and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third party property owners and franchisees to take cost saving measures during economic downturns 
we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by third party property owners and franchisees 
we and our third party property owners and franchisees may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future 
potential changes in the federal regulatory scheme could make it easier for unions to organize groups of our associates 
if such changes take effect  more of our associates or other field personnel could be subject to increased organizational efforts  which could potentially lead to disruptions or require more of our management s time to address unionization issues 
these or similar agreements  legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations  hinder our ability to cross train and cross promote our associates due to prescribed work rules and job classifications  reduce our profitability  or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 
the loss of our senior executives or key field personnel  such as our general managers  could significantly harm our business 
our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior executives 
we have entered into employment letter agreements with certain of our senior executives 
however  we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us 
finding suitable replacements for our senior executives could be difficult 
we currently do not have a life insurance policy or key person insurance policy with respect to any of our senior executives 
losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect our strategic relationships  including relationships with our third party property owners  franchisees  hospitality venture partners and vendors  and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 
we also rely on the general managers at each of our owned and managed properties to run daily operations and oversee our associates 
these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide 
the failure to retain  train or successfully manage our general managers for our properties could negatively affect our operations 
because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states  the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues  increase our costs  reduce our profits or disrupt our business 
we currently manage  franchise or own hotels and resorts in countries around the world 
our operations outside the united states represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues 
as a result  we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states  including the laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations  as well as us laws affecting the activities of us companies abroad  limitations penalties on the repatriation of non us earnings  import and export licensing requirements and regulations  as well as unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  including imposition of tariffs or embargoes  export regulations and controls and other trade restrictions  political and economic instability  
table of contents the difficulty of managing an organization doing business in many jurisdictions  potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies and currency exchange rate fluctuations or currency restructurings  uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract clauses  and rapid changes in government  economic and political policies  political or civil unrest  acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us anti boycott legislation 
while these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict  any one or more of them could lower our revenues  increase our costs  reduce our profits or disrupt our business 
exchange rate fluctuations or currency restructurings could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses or lead to costs and risks related to exchange rate hedging activities 
conducting business in currencies other than us dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency restructurings that could have a negative impact on our financial results 
we translate the value of foreign currency denominated amounts into us dollars  and we report our consolidated financial results of operations in us dollars 
because the value of the us dollar fluctuates relative to other currencies  revenues that we generate or expenses that we incur in other currencies could significantly increase or decrease our revenues or expenses as reported in us dollars 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or currency restructurings will continue to grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the united states increases 
we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  referred to as hedging activities 
however  these hedging activities may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own  such as ongoing management time and expertise and external costs related to executing hedging activities 
if purchasers default on the loans we provide to finance their purchases of our vacation ownership properties  the revenues and profits we derive from our vacation ownership business could be reduced 
we provide secured financing to some of the purchasers of our vacation ownership properties in respect of which we are subject to the risk of purchaser default 
if a purchaser defaults under the financing we provide  we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the property 
if the property has declined in value  we may incur impairment charges or losses as a result 
in addition  we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price 
as of december   we had million of mortgage receivables  net of allowances associated with these activities 
in addition  if a purchaser of a vacation ownership property defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period  we may not have recovered the marketing  selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of such vacation ownership property 
if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser  or if our allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate  the profits we derive from our vacation ownership business could be reduced 
private resales of our vacation ownership interests could lower the demand or prices for our vacation ownership properties  which could reduce our revenues and our profits 
we develop  sell or manage vacation ownership properties in select locations as part of the hyatt residence club  which is changing its name from hyatt vacation club 
private resales by owners of these vacation ownership interests in the secondary market could reduce demand or prices for new vacation ownership interests  particularly if the owners sell their interests at a significant discount 
lower demand or prices for our vacation ownership interests could reduce our revenues and our profits 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs  reduce our profits or limit our growth 
our business  properties and associates are subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
generally  these laws and regulations address our sales and marketing efforts  our handling of privacy issues and customer data  our ability to obtain licenses for business operations such as sales of food and liquor  immigration matters  environmental  health and safety  gaming  competition and trade laws  among other things 
our franchising and vacation ownership businesses and our operations outside the united states are also subject to laws and regulations affecting those businesses 
franchising our franchising business is subject to various state laws  as well as to regulations enacted by the federal trade commission ftc 
a number of states require franchisors to register with the state or to make extensive disclosures to potential franchisees in connection with offers and sales in those states 
the ftc also regulates the manner and substance of our disclosures to prospective franchisees 
in addition  several states have franchise relationship laws or business opportunity laws that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of those agreements 
vacation ownership our vacation ownership properties are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the property is located and the states in which the property is marketed and sold 
our marketing for these properties is also subject to federal regulation of certain marketing practices  including federal telemarketing regulations 
in addition  the laws of most states in which we sell vacation ownership interests give the purchaser the right to rescind the purchase contract within a specified time period 
international operations our business operations in countries outside the united states are subject to a number of us federal laws and regulations  including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac and the commerce department 
the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials or parties and requires public companies in the united states to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies transactions 
ofac and the commerce department administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states  organizations and individuals 
if we  or our hospitality ventures  fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we could be exposed to claims for damages  financial penalties  reputational harm  incarceration of our employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties  including the termination of our management  franchise and ownership rights 
these restrictions could increase our costs of operations  reduce our profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support our growth 
the extensive environmental requirements to which we are subject could increase our environmental costs and liabilities  reduce our profits or limit our ability to run our business 
our operations and the properties we manage  own and develop are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations of various federal  state  local and foreign governments  including requirements addressing health and safety  the use  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  discharges of waste materials into the environment  such as refuse or sewage  and air emissions 

table of contents we could be subject to liability under some of these laws for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes on  under  or in real property we currently or formerly manage  own or develop  or third party sites where we sent hazardous substances or wastes for disposal 
we could be held liable under these laws regardless of whether we knew of  or were at fault in connection with  the presence or release of any such hazardous or toxic substances or wastes 
some of these laws make each covered person responsible for all of the costs involved  even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination 
furthermore  a person who arranges for hazardous substances or wastes to be transported  disposed of or treated offsite  such as at disposal or treatment facilities  may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation if those substances are released into the environment by third parties at such disposal or treatment facilities 
the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes  or the failure to properly clean up such materials  could cause us to incur significant costs  or jeopardize our ability to develop  use  sell or rent real property we own or operate or to borrow using such property as collateral 
other laws and regulations require us to manage  abate or remove materials containing hazardous substances such as mold  lead or asbestos during demolitions  renovations or remodeling at properties that we manage  own or develop or to obtain permits for certain of our equipment or operations 
the costs of such management  abatement  removal or permitting could be substantial 
complying with these laws and regulations  or addressing violations arising under them  could increase our environmental costs and liabilities  reduce our profits or limit our ability to run our business 
existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to global climate change  air quality  or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us 
the identification of new areas of contamination  a change in the extent or known scope of contamination or changes in cleanup requirements  or the adoption of new requirements governing our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations  financial condition and business 
if the insurance that we carry  our owners carry or our franchisees carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities involving properties that we own  manage or franchise  our profits could be reduced 
we carry  our owners carry and our franchisees carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary 
nevertheless  market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we  our owners or our franchisees can obtain or restrict our ability  our owners ability or our franchisees ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates 
in the event of a substantial loss  the insurance coverage that we carry  our owners carry or our franchisees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations  our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property loss 
because certain types of losses are significantly uncertain  they can be uninsurable or too expensive to insure 
in some cases  these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues  profits  management fees or incentive income from the property  we could remain obligated for performance guarantees in favor of third party property owners or for their debt or other financial obligations  suffer an uninsured or underinsured property loss and we may not have sufficient insurance to cover awards of damages resulting from our liabilities 
if the insurance that we carry  our owners carry or our franchisees carry does not sufficiently cover damages or other losses or liabilities  our profits could be adversely affected 
any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business 
the reputation and perception of our brands is critical to our success in the hospitality industry 
if our trademarks or intellectual property are copied or used without authorization  the value of our brands  their reputation  our competitive advantages and our goodwill could be harmed 
we regularly apply to register our trademarks in the united states and other countries 
however  we cannot assure you that those trademark 
table of contents registrations will be granted or that the steps we take to protect our trademarks or intellectual property in the united states and other countries will be adequate to prevent others  including third parties or former employees  from copying or using our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization 
our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries outside the united states  where we may not be adequately protected by local law 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
as we have in the past  we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
litigation of this type could be costly  force us to divert our resources  lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business 
any failure to maintain and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of our brands and harm our business 
third party claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 
third parties may make claims against us for infringing their intellectual property rights 
any such claims  even those without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  force us to stop providing products or services that use the intellectual property that is being challenged  force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services  divert our management s attention and resources  force us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property  or force us to pay significant damages 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify third party owners of the hotels we manage or franchisees for any losses they incur as a result of any such infringement claims 
any necessary royalty or licensing agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
any costs  lost revenues  changes to our business or management attention related to intellectual property claims against us  whether successful or not  could impact our business 
adverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business 
in the normal course of our business  we are often involved in various legal proceedings 
the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted 
if any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  we could become the subject of future claims by third parties  including current or former third party property owners  guests who use our properties  our employees  our investors or regulators 
any significant adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business 
further  we may incur costs related to claims for which we have appropriate third party indemnity  but such third parties fail to fulfill their contractual obligations 
information technology system failures  delays in the operation of our information technology systems or system enhancement failures could reduce our revenues and profits and harm the reputation of our brands and our business 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems 
for example  we depend on our central reservation system  which allows bookings by hotels directly  via 
table of contents telephone through our call centers  by travel agents  online through our website www 
hyatt 
com  and through our online reservations partners 
in addition  we depend on information technology to run our day to day operations  including  among others  hotel services and amenities such as guest check in and check out  housekeeping and room service and systems for tracking and reporting our financial results and the financial results of our hotels 
our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  floods  hurricanes  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  break ins and similar events 
the occurrence of any of these natural disasters or unanticipated problems at any of our information technology facilities or any of our call centers could cause interruptions or delays in our business or loss of data  or render us unable to process reservations 
in addition  if our information technology systems are unable to provide the information communications capacity that we need  or if our information technology systems suffer problems caused by installing system enhancements  we could experience similar failures or interruptions 
if our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures  or if our property and business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur  our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be harmed 
cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions  harm to our reputation or subject us to costs  fines or lawsuits 
we are required to collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data  including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information and our various information technology systems enter  process  summarize and report such data 
we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees 
the integrity and protection of our customer  employee and company data is critical to our business 
our customers expect that we will adequately protect their personal information  and the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding  both in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we operate 
we have developed and maintain controls to prevent  and we have a process to identify and mitigate  the theft  loss  fraudulent or unlawful use of customer  employee or company data 
we also have what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft  loss  fraudulent or unlawful use of customer  employee or company data 
a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional  inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft  loss  fraudulent or unlawful use of customer  employee or company data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs  fines or lawsuits and which could be in excess of any available insurance that we have procured 
if we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business  our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished 
sophisticated information technology and other systems are instrumental for the hospitality industry  including systems used for our central reservations  revenue management  property management and our hyatt gold passport program  as well as technology systems that we make available to our guests 
these information technology and other systems must be refined  updated  or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis 
developing and maintaining these systems may require significant capital 
if we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or need replacing  or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems  our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished 
we may be liable for proposed tax liabilities and the final amount of taxes paid may exceed the amount of applicable reserves  which could reduce our profits 
the internal revenue service the irs has completed its examinations of the originally filed consolidated federal income tax returns of hyatt hotels corporation  hyatt corporation  aic and h group for 
table of contents the taxable years ended december   and based on these examinations  we could be liable for up to million of additional taxes and penalties plus accrued interest 
we and our affiliates have filed protests with the irs appeals office contesting these proposed tax liabilities 
our consolidated federal income tax returns for the taxable years ended december   and and the amended return for the taxable year ended december  are currently under examination  and we are also subject to ongoing tax audits and disputes in various state  local and foreign jurisdictions 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for potential tax liabilities  but the final amount of taxes assessed and paid could exceed the amount of such reserves  which could reduce our profits 
changes in federal  state  local or foreign tax law  interpretations of existing tax law or agreements with tax authorities could affect our profitability and financial condition by increasing our tax costs 
we are subject to taxation at the federal  state or provincial and local levels in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions 
our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
from time to time the us federal  state  local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application thereof  which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretation and could adversely impact profitability 
state and local tax authorities have also increased their efforts to increase revenues through changes in tax law and audits 
such changes and proposals  if enacted  could increase our future effective income tax rates 
we are a party to certain agreements with foreign tax authorities that reduce or defer the amount of tax we pay 
the expiration of such agreements  or changes in circumstances or in interpretation of such agreements  could increase our tax costs 
the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes place restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries  reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks 
the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain covenants that place restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries 
the covenants under our revolving credit facility restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  due to a requirement that we satisfy a maximum leverage ratio test and a maximum secured funded debt ratio test  engage in other business activities or engage in certain transactions with affiliates  change our fiscal year or change our organizational documents  and make certain restricted payments 
similarly  the covenants under our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict  among other things  our ability to create any liens on certain assets to secure debt  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  or enter into mergers or consolidations  transfer all or substantially all of our assets or dissolve  liquidate or wind up our affairs 
failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not waived or cured  if applicable  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes 

table of contents an increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on our revolving credit facility and any variable rate debt we incur  which could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or acquire assets 
interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility are either libor based or based on an alternate base rate  with margins in each case based on our credit rating or  in certain circumstances  our credit rating and leverage ratio 
to the extent we borrow under the revolving credit facility  any increase in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings will reduce our cash flows available for other corporate purposes  including investments in our portfolio 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced 
we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging contracts 
while these agreements may lessen the impact of rising interest rates  they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets  thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy 
rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital 
the interest rate on borrowings and the facility fee under our revolving credit facility are determined by a pricing grid  which is dependent in part on our credit ratings by standard poor s rating group  a division of mcgraw hill  inc s p  and moody s investors service  inc moody s 
lower ratings result in a higher cost of funds 
therefore  subject to any adjustments to the interest rate based on our leverage ratio  if these independent rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings or if we no longer have a credit rating from either agency  the cost of our borrowing and the amount of the facility fee under our revolving credit facility will increase as specified in the pricing grid 
additionally  any future downgrade of our credit ratings by the rating agencies could reduce or limit our access to capital and increase our cost of capital 
we and a number of our competitors have had either a rating or outlook downgrade by the rating agencies as a result of the recent economic downturn and decreased demand for hospitality products and services 
given the cyclical nature of the hospitality industry and its dependence on the underlying health of the economy  we could be subject to frequent changes in our credit rating 
as the economic recovery is expected to be slow in the near term  there is a continuing risk of our credit ratings being revised downward 
we have a large amount of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and are exposed to counterparty risk with respect to these deposits 
all of our cash that is not required to fund our daily operating activities is invested in interest bearing investments with a greater focus placed on capital preservation than on investment return 
the majority of our cash balances are held on deposit with high quality financial institutions that hold long term ratings of at least bbb or baa from s p or moody s  respectively  and in aaa rated money market funds 
as such  we are exposed to counterparty risk on our million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  during we established an investment account for purposes of investing a portion of our cash resources 
in and continuing in  we began transferring cash and cash equivalent balances to the account for investment in corporate notes and bonds and us treasuries and agencies 
as such  we are exposed to counterparty risk on our million of short term investments as of december  as a result of becoming a public company  we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements  which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business 
as a public company  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company  including costs associated with public company reporting requirements 
we also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange  and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and 
table of contents corporate governance purposes have been increasing 
we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly  although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty 
these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as our executive officers 
furthermore  if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company  we could be subject to delisting of our class a common stock  fines  sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation 
risks related to share ownership and stockholder matters our stock price is likely to be volatile  and you may not be able to resell shares of your class a common stock at or above the price you paid 
the stock market in general  and hospitality companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the underlying businesses 
given that we are a relatively new public company  these fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock 
in addition  in the past few years the financial services industry experienced a period of significant disruption characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  which led to increased volatility in securities prices and a significant level of intervention from the us and other governments in securities markets 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our class a common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in addition to the risks described in this section  several factors that could cause the price of our class a common stock in the public market to fluctuate significantly include  among others  the following quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations  announcements of acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and properties or dispositions  announcements of new services or products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors  size of the public float  future conversions to and sales of our class a common stock by current holders of class b common stock in the public market  or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of class b common stock intend to sell shares  stock price performance of our competitors  fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes  default on our indebtedness or foreclosure of our properties  changes in senior management or key personnel  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  negative earnings or other announcements by us or other hospitality companies  downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors  issuances or repurchases of equity or debt securities  and global economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
volatility in the market price of our class a common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their class a common stock at or above the price at which you purchased the stock 
as a result  you may suffer a loss on your investment 

table of contents securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs  reduce our profits  divert our management s attention and resources and harm our business 
pritzker family business interests have substantial control over us and have the ability to control the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval  which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters or result in actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests 
our class b common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and our class a common stock is entitled to one vote per share 
pritzker family business interests beneficially own  in the aggregate   shares  or approximately  of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  consistent with the voting agreements contained in the amended and restated global hyatt agreement and the amended and restated foreign global hyatt agreement  pritzker family business interests will be able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction 
while the voting agreements are in effect  they may provide our board of directors with the effective control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
because of our dual class ownership structure  pritzker family business interests will continue to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over matters requiring stockholder approval  even if they own less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
this concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters  and the interests of pritzker family business interests may not coincide with our interests or your interests 
as a result  we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price

disputes among pritzker family members and among pritzker family members and the trustees of the pritzker family trusts may result in significant distractions to our management  disrupt our business  have a negative effect on the trading price of our class a common stock and or generate negative publicity about hyatt and the pritzker family 
in the past  disputes have arisen between and among certain pritzker family members  and between and among beneficiaries of the pritzker family trusts and the trustees of such trusts  with respect to  among other things  the ownership  operation  governance  and management of certain pritzker family business interests 
in connection with certain of these disputes  claims were alleged  and in certain cases  proceedings were initiated  against certain pritzker family members  including thomas j 
pritzker  our executive chairman  and other pritzker family members  some of whom have been or are our directors  and against the trustees  including thomas j 
pritzker in his capacity as a co trustee of the pritzker family us situs trusts 
such past allegations related to  among others  trust management and administration  and violations of certain trustee duties  including fiduciary duties 
some of these disputes led to significant negative publicity for the pritzker family 
these disputes have been resolved with no admissions or finding of any misconduct 
with respect to hyatt  disputes arose between and among certain pritzker family members and the trustees of trusts with respect to  among other things  our dual class structure  which became effective prior to the completion of our initial public offering 
in particular  certain beneficiaries of pritzker family trusts expressed 
table of contents concern that there could be a value differential between our class a and class b common stock based on the difference in voting rights between those two classes of stock 
additionally  certain beneficiaries of pritzker family trusts noted that the dual class structure had the effect of extending the duration of the voting and lock up restrictions under the global hyatt agreement and foreign global hyatt agreement due to the fact that the duration of those restrictions  as originally drafted  was based  in part  on voting power of the outstanding shares of our stock owned by pritzker family members and spouses including any us or us situs trusts for the current or future  direct or indirect  vested or contingent  benefit of any pritzker family members and spouses rather than on the percentage of the outstanding shares of our stock owned by them 
in connection with these disputes  the global hyatt agreement and the foreign global hyatt agreement were amended and restated in three important respects  as described under part i  item  business stockholder agreements 
first  the agreements were amended and restated to measure the duration of the voting and lock up restrictions under the global hyatt agreement and foreign global hyatt agreement on the percentage of outstanding shares  not voting power of shares  of our stock owned by pritzker family members and spouses including any us or us situs trusts for the current or future  direct or indirect  vested or contingent  benefit of any pritzker family members and spouses 
second  the agreements were amended and restated to permit pritzker family members and spouses including any us or us situs trusts for the current or future  direct or indirect  vested or contingent  benefit of any pritzker family members and spouses to sell up to of their aggregate holdings of our common stock  measured as of november  the date of effectiveness of our registration statement on form s file no 
relating to our initial public offering of our class a common stock  during each month period following the date of effectiveness of such registration statement without carry overs  rather than measured on a similar basis though shares sold in the initial public offering counted toward the first month period s limit 
additionally  the prohibition on selling shares to any aggregator ie  a person who is required to file a schedule d under the exchange act  disclosing an intent other than for investment was removed 
third  the amended and restated agreements provided for the distribution of hyatt stock from us or us situs trusts for the current or future  direct or indirect  vested or contingent  benefit of any pritzker family members and spouses in consultation with the adult beneficiaries of such trusts as soon as practicable following november   the date of effectiveness of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering of our class a common stock  subject to the amended and restated global hyatt agreement and the amended and restated foreign global hyatt agreement 
the distribution of hyatt stock from the pritzker family us and us situs trusts occurred on august  in connection with such distribution  the trustees of the recipient personal trusts became party to the amended and restated global hyatt agreement and amended and restated foreign global hyatt agreement  as applicable 
as a result of such changes to the agreements  pritzker family members and spouses including any us or us situs trusts for the current or future  direct or indirect  vested or contingent  benefit of any pritzker family members and spouses may now sell up to of their common stock over a shorter period of time 
see part i  item  business stockholder agreements and a significant number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of class b common stock could be sold into the market  which could depress our stock price even if our business is doing well 
as part of these discussions  we agreed to provide  in the registration rights agreement  for a shelf registration in order to facilitate sales of common stock by domestic and foreign pritzker stockholders 
disputes among pritzker family members  and between and among beneficiaries of the pritzker family trusts and the trustees of such trusts  including with respect to hyatt  may arise or continue in the future 
if such disputes occur  they may result in significant distractions to our management  disrupt our business  have a negative effect on the trading price of our class a common stock and or generate negative publicity about hyatt and pritzker family members  including pritzker family members involved with hyatt

these voting agreements expire on the later to occur of december  and the date that thomas j 
pritzker is no longer chairman of our board of directors 
see part i  item  business stockholder agreements 
while the voting agreements are in effect  they may provide our board of directors with effective control over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction 
this is because the number of our shares that are required by the voting agreements to be voted consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors will be sufficient to determine the outcome of the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval 
this will limit your ability to influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval  even if you do not believe those actions to be in our interests or your interests 
for instance  the voting agreements may have the effect of delaying or preventing a transaction that would result in a change of control  if our board of directors does not recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the transaction  even if you or some or all of our major stockholders believe that the transaction is in our interests or your interests 
on the other hand  the voting agreements may result in our stockholders approving a transaction that would result in a change of control  if our board of directors recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the transaction  even if you or some or all of our major stockholders believe that the transaction is not in our interests or your interests

reports published by securities or industry analysts  including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results  could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume 
securities research analysts have established and publish their own quarterly projections for our business

anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law  as well as agreements with our major stockholders  may discourage or prevent a change of control  even if a sale of hyatt would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as agreements with our major stockholders  contain provisions that may make it difficult to remove our board of directors and management and may discourage or delay change of control transactions that certain stockholders may view as beneficial or could involve the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our class a common stock 
these provisions include  among others our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class ownership structure  in which our class b common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and our class a common stock is 
table of contents entitled to one vote per share

our board of directors is divided into three classes  with each class serving for a staggered three year term  which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting 
our directors may be removed only for cause  which prevents stockholders from being able to remove directors without cause other than those directors who are being elected at an annual meeting 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors 
as a result  holders of our class b common stock will control the election of directors and the ability of holders of our class a common stock to elect director candidates will be limited

special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the chairman of the board or by our corporate secretary at the direction of our board of directors 
advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 
our board of directors may  without stockholder approval  issue series of preferred stock  or rights to acquire preferred stock  that could dilute the interest of  or impair the voting power of  holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change of control

overview we are a global hospitality company engaged in the management  franchising  ownership and development of hyatt branded hotels  resorts and residential and vacation ownership properties around the world 
as of december   our worldwide portfolio consisted of hyatt branded properties  rooms and units  including managed properties  rooms  all of which we operate under management agreements with third party property owners  franchised properties  rooms  all of which are owned by third parties that have franchise agreements with us and are operated by third parties  owned properties including consolidated hospitality ventures  rooms and leased properties  rooms  all of which we manage  managed properties and franchised properties owned or leased by unconsolidated hospitality ventures  rooms  vacation ownership properties units  all of which we manage  and residential properties  units  all of which we manage and some of which we own 
we have a business model that involves both ownership of properties and management and franchising of third party owned properties 
this allows us to pursue more diversified revenue and income streams that balance both the advantages and risks associated with these lines of business 
our expertise and experience in each of these areas gives us the flexibility to evaluate growth opportunities across these lines of business 
growth in the number of management and franchise agreements and earnings therefrom typically results in higher overall returns on invested capital because the capital investment under a typical management or franchise agreement is not significant 
the capital required to build and maintain hotels that we manage for third party owners  or franchise  is typically provided by the owner of the respective property with minimal capital required by us as the manager or franchisor 
during periods of increasing demand we do not share fully in the incremental profits of hotel operations for hotels that we manage for third party owners as our fee arrangements generally include a base amount calculated using the revenue from the subject hotel and an incentive fee that is  typically  a percentage of hotel profits that is usually less than  with the actual level depending on the structure and terms of the management agreement 
we do not share in the benefits of increases in profits from franchised properties because franchisees pay us an initial application fee and ongoing royalty fees that are calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues with no fees based on profits 
disputes or disruptions may arise with third party owners of hotels we manage or franchise and these disputes can result in termination of the relevant agreement 
with respect to property ownership  we believe that ownership of selected hotels in key markets enhances our ability to control our brand presence in these markets 
ownership of hotels allows us to capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand and room rates 
the cost structure of a typical hotel is more fixed than variable  so as demand and room rates increase over time  the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues 
hotel ownership is  
table of contents however  more capital intensive than managing hotels for third party owners  as we are responsible for the costs and all capital expenditures for our owned hotels 
the profits realized in our owned and leased hotel segment are generally more significantly affected by economic downturns and declines in revenues than the results of our management and franchising segments 
this is because we absorb the full impact of declining profits in our owned and leased hotels whereas our management and franchise fees do not have the same level of downside exposure to declining hotel profitability 
see also principal factors affecting our results of operations factors affecting our costs and expenses fixed nature of expenses and part i  item a  risk factors risks related to our business we are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate  which could increase our costs  reduce our profits  limit our ability to respond to market conditions or restrict our growth strategy 
for the years ended december   and    and of our revenues were derived from operations in the united states  respectively 
as of december  and  and of our long lived assets were located in the united states  respectively 
we report our consolidated operations in us dollars and manage our business within three reportable segments as described below owned and leased hotels  which consists of our owned and leased full service and select service hotels and  for purposes of segment adjusted ebitda  our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures  based on our ownership percentage of each venture 
north american management and franchising  which consists of our management and franchising of properties located in the united states  canada and the caribbean 
international management and franchising  which consists of our management and franchising of properties located outside of the united states  canada and the caribbean 
in addition to our three reportable segments  corporate and other includes the results of our vacation ownership business  the results of our co branded credit card launched in  and unallocated corporate expenses 
key business metrics evaluated by management revenues we primarily derive our revenues from hotel operations  management and franchise fees  other revenues from managed properties and vacation ownership properties 
management uses revenues to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends such as consumer demand  brand preference and competition 
for a detailed discussion of the factors that affect our revenues  see principal factors affecting our results of operations 
net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation represents the total earnings or profits generated by our business 
management uses net income to analyze the performance of our business on a consolidated basis 
adjusted ebitda we use the term adjusted ebitda throughout this annual report 
adjusted ebitda  as we define it  is a non gaap measure 
we define consolidated adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to hyatt hotels corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures adjusted ebitda based on our ownership percentage of each venture  adjusted to exclude the following items equity earnings losses from unconsolidated hospitality ventures  
table of contents gains losses on sales of real estate  asset impairments  other income loss  net  discontinued operations  net of tax  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and provision benefit for income taxes 
we calculate consolidated adjusted ebitda by adding the adjusted ebitda of each of our reportable segments to corporate and other adjusted ebitda 
see results of operations 
our board of directors and executive management team focus on adjusted ebitda as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis 
adjusted ebitda assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis 
our president and chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker  also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments  in significant part  by assessing the adjusted ebitda of each segment 
in addition  the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated adjusted ebitda  segment adjusted ebitda or some combination of both 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making selected compensation decisions 
adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for net income loss attributable to hyatt hotels corporation  income loss from continuing operations  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure prescribed by gaap 
there are limitations to using non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda 
although we believe that adjusted ebitda can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations  other companies in our industry may define adjusted ebitda differently than we do 
as a result  it may be difficult to use adjusted ebitda or similarly named non gaap measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
our management compensates for these limitations by reference to our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda supplementally 
see our consolidated statements of income loss and consolidated statements of cash flows in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

revenue per available room revpar revpar is the product of the average daily rate and the average daily occupancy percentage 
revpar does not include non room revenues  which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property  such as food and beverage  parking  telephone and other guest service revenues 
our management uses revpar to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis 
revpar is a commonly used performance measure in the industry 

table of contents revpar changes that are driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes that are driven predominately by changes in average room rates 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs  and could also result in increased ancillary revenues including food and beverage 
in contrast  changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs 
average daily rate adr adr represents hotel room revenues  divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period 
adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels 
adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry  and we use adr to assess the pricing levels that we are able to generate by customer group  as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy  as described above 
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels 
occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity 
management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period 
occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 
comparable hotels comparable systemwide hotels represents all properties we manage or franchise including owned and leased properties and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage  business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available 
we may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide north american full service or select service hotels or comparable systemwide international full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the north american and international management and franchising segments  respectively 
comparable operated hotels is defined the same as comparable systemwide hotels with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise 
comparable owned and leased hotels represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage  business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available 
comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in the industry 
non comparable systemwide hotels or non comparable owned and leased hotels represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of comparable as defined above 
principal factors affecting our results of operations revenues principal components we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources revenues from hotel operations 
represents revenues derived from hotel operations  including room rentals and food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues at our owned and leased properties 
revenues from the majority of our hotel operations depend heavily on demand from group and transient travelers  as discussed below 
revenues from our owned and leased hotels segment are primarily derived from hotel operations 

table of contents revenues from room rentals and ancillary revenues are primarily derived from three categories of customers transient  group and contract 
transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure 
our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve a minimum of rooms for meetings or social functions sponsored by associations  corporate  social  military  educational  religious or other organizations 
group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services  such as catering and banquet services 
our contract guests are traveling under a contract negotiated for a block of rooms for more than days in duration at agreed upon rates 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
management and franchise fees 
represents revenues derived from fees earned from hotels and residential properties managed worldwide usually under long term management agreements  franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands usually under long term franchise agreements  termination fees and the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement 
our management agreements typically provide for a two tiered fee structure that compensates us both for the volume of business we generate for the property as well as for the profitability of hotel operations 
in these two tier fee structures  our base compensation is a base fee that is usually an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations 
in addition  we are paid an incentive fee that is typically calculated as a percentage of a hotel profitability measure  as defined in the applicable agreement 
outside of the united states  our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures  either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure  or because our two tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee 
franchise fees generally consist of an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees calculated as a percentage of gross room revenues 
royalty fees for our full service brands also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and gross spa revenues  where applicable 
other revenues from managed properties 
represents revenues related primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer and are fully reimbursed by the third party property owner based on the costs incurred  with no added margin 
as a result  these revenues have no effect on our profit  although they do increase our total revenues and the corresponding costs increase our total expenses 
we record these revenues in other revenues from managed properties and the corresponding costs in other costs from managed properties in our consolidated statements of income loss 
intersegment eliminations 
we evaluate our reportable segments with intersegment revenues and expenses included in their results 
these intersegment revenues and expenses represent management fees earned by our north america and international management and franchising segments for managing our owned and leased hotels 
as presented throughout this annual report  the individual segment results for the management and franchising businesses include the intersegment fee revenues and our owned and leased hotels include the intersegment fee expenses 
both the intersegment fee revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation 
factors affecting our revenues the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 
for other factors affecting our revenues  see part i  item a  risk factors risks related to our business 
consumer demand and global economic conditions 
consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels 
declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions  risks affecting or reducing travel patterns  lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned hotel operations and the amount of management and franchising fee revenues we are 
table of contents able to generate from our managed and franchised properties 
also  declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly impact the incentive portion of our management fees  since it is based on hotel profit measures 
our vacation ownership business is also linked to cycles in the general economy and consumer discretionary spending 
as a result  changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatility 
see part i  item a  risk factors risks related to the hospitality industry 
during  the global economic recession and its negative effect on demand by transient business and leisure travelers and associations and other group customers depressed demand throughout the hospitality industry 
these conditions resulted in some of the most significant revpar declines we have experienced in recent history throughout this reduced demand resulted in decreases in occupancy levels and adr 
in  we started experiencing signs of recovery  which continued throughout each of the three operating segments experienced increased revpar in as compared to and this contributed to improved performance in our consolidated revenues and adjusted ebitda 
overall improvement in adr helped drive the revpar increases seen in each operating segment 
in north america  further recovery of transient business at our full service hotels helped drive our revenue growth in as compared to our international management and franchising business experienced significant revpar improvement driven by adr improvement in all regions 
while our north america full service and international results reflect signs of improvement  they are based on revpar that is still below our pre recession levels 
competition 
the global lodging industry is highly competitive 
during periods of decreased demand for hospitality products and services  as experienced in the recent economic recession  competition in the industry becomes increasingly fierce 
while we generally try to maintain rates under such circumstances whenever possible  the overall reduction in business travel during the recession placed significant pressure on occupancy levels at our properties as well as those of our competitors 
accordingly  in and to a lesser extent in we increased the number of promotional offers and expanded individual hotels use of internet distribution channels  which offer different customer price points  in an effort to expose more customers to our products and services and to attract guests 
internet distribution channels are online sites that sell hospitality related products and services of multiple brands 
while revpar levels have increased throughout and  they still remain lower than pre recession highs across the majority of our portfolio 
we believe that our brand strength and ability to manage our operations in an efficient manner will help us to compete successfully within the global hospitality industry 
agreements with third party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers 
we depend on our long term management and franchise agreements with third party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchising fee revenues 
the success and sustainability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchising agreements and maintain good relationships with third party owners and franchisees 
our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth 
we believe that we have good relationships with our third party owners  franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships 
these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners  franchisees and developers and are not heavily concentrated with any particular third party 
access to capital 
the hospitality industry is a capital intensive business that requires significant amounts of capital expenditures to develop  maintain and renovate properties 
third party owners are required to fund these capital expenditures for the properties they own in accordance with the terms of the applicable management or franchise agreement 
access to the capital that we or our third party owners  franchisees or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues 
the availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third party owners  franchisees or development partners can obtain capital can have a 
table of contents significant impact on the overall level and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues 
we believe that a continued normalization of credit markets as well as improvements in the global economy and overall business environment will be necessary before we see a material increase in development activity with third parties 
expenses principal components we primarily incur the following expenses owned and leased hotel expenses 
owned and leased hotel expenses comprise the largest portion of our total direct and selling  general and administrative expenses and reflect the expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels 
expenses to operate our hotels include room expense  food and beverage costs  other support costs and property expenses 
room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping  laundry and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry 
food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products 
other support expenses consist of costs associated with property level management including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts  utilities  sales and marketing  operating hotel spas  telephones  parking and other guest recreation  entertainment and services 
property expenses include property taxes  repairs and maintenance  rent and insurance 
depreciation and amortization expense 
these are non cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings  furniture  fixtures and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels 
amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of management agreement acquisition costs and franchise and brand intangibles  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  including deferred compensation plans for certain employees that are funded through contributions to rabbi trusts  for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments including divisional offices that support our management and franchising segments  professional fees including consulting  audit and legal fees  travel and entertainment expenses  bad debt expenses  contractual performance obligations and office administrative and related expenses 
other costs from managed properties 
represents costs related primarily to payroll expenses at managed properties where we are the employer 
these costs are reimbursed to us with no added margin 
as a result  these costs have no effect on our profit  although they do increase our total expenses and the corresponding reimbursements increase our total revenues 
we record these costs in other costs from managed properties and the corresponding revenues in other revenues from managed properties in our consolidated statements of income loss 
factors affecting our costs and expenses the following are several principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 
for other factors affecting our costs and expenses  see part i  item a  risk factors risks related to our business 
fixed nature of expenses 
many of the expenses associated with managing  franchising  owning and developing hotels and residential and vacation ownership properties are relatively fixed 
these expenses include personnel costs  rent  property taxes  insurance and utilities 
if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases  the resulting decline in our revenues can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flow  margins and profits 
this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 
economic downturns generally 
table of contents affect the results of our owned and leased hotel segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property 
the effectiveness of any cost cutting efforts is limited by the fixed cost nature of our business 
as a result  we may not always be able to offset reductions in revenue through cost cutting 
employees at some of our owned hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues 
in addition  efforts to reduce costs  or to defer or cancel capital improvements  could adversely affect the economic value of our properties and brands 
we intend to manage our cost structure at levels appropriate for the degree of demand and revenue generated at our hotels 
changes in depreciation expenses 
changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing properties  acquisition or development of new properties or the disposition of existing properties through sale or closure 
we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in businesses  properties or other assets 
if we consummate any asset acquisitions  we would likely add depreciable assets  which would result in an increase in depreciation expense 
demand for vacation ownership properties 
the economic downturn severely reduced consumer demand for vacation ownership properties 
a significant portion of our costs to support our vacation ownership business relates to direct sales and marketing at these properties 
accordingly  we reduced and continue to monitor these costs so they correspond to current levels of demand 
our vacation ownership business recorded total impairment charges of million in and million in the impairment charge was primarily a result of a change in management s assumptions regarding future sales volume and pricing of unsold vacation ownership intervals 
the impairment charge was due to a change in management s plans for future development of multi phase vacation ownership properties 
we may be required to take additional impairment charges in the future if demand levels fall further 
other items asset impairments we hold significant amounts of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and equity method investments 
we evaluate these assets on a quarterly basis for impairment as further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates 
these evaluations have  in the past  resulted in impairment charges for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding those assets 
we may be required to take additional impairment charges to reflect further declines in our asset and or investment values 
acquisitions  investments  divestitures and significant renovations we periodically acquire  divest ourselves of or undertake significant renovations in hotel properties 
the results of operations derived from these properties do not  therefore  meet the definition of comparable hotels as defined in key business metrics evaluated by management 
the results of operations from these properties  however  may have a material effect on changes in our results from period to period and are  therefore  discussed separately in our discussion on results of operations when material 
in  we entered into the following transactions acquired from lodgeworks hotels  branding and management rights to an additional four hotels  and other assets for a total purchase price of approximately million  sold six hyatt place and two hyatt summerfield suites properties to a new joint venture that an affiliate of the company formed with a third party

additionally  the ownership interest in the hyatt regency princeton was transferred to the lender through a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction 
effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations a significant portion of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar 
as a result  we are required to translate those results from the functional currency into us dollars at market based average exchange rates during the period reported 
when comparing our results of operations between periods  there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expense that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods

critical accounting policies and estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the following accounting policies are critical due to the fact 
table of contents that they involve a higher degree of judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as a result  these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
in addition  changes in the accounting estimates that we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values in a two step process 
we define a reporting unit at the individual property or business level 
we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist 
when determining fair value in step one  we utilize internally developed discounted future cash flow models  third party appraisals and  if appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers 
under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions  including projections of revenues based on assumed long term growth rates  estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the weighted average cost of capital 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions 
the weighted average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and long term debt 
our estimates of long term growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine  long term planning process 
we then compare the estimated fair value to our carrying value 
if the carrying value is in excess of the fair value  we must perform step two in order to determine our implied fair value of goodwill to measure if any impairment charge is necessary 
the determination of our implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the reporting unit s estimated fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if we had completed a business combination 
we perform the allocation based on our knowledge of the reporting unit  the market in which they operate  and our overall knowledge of the hospitality industry 
changes in our allocation approach could result in different measures of implied fair value and impact the final impairment charge  if any 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
we had million of goodwill as of december  and an adverse change to our fair value estimates could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our earnings 
the company has six reporting units on which we have a goodwill balance as of december  a change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows  discount rates  or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would result in an impairment charge of the entire million goodwill balance of one of our reporting units as of december  the company will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic environment on the goodwill of our reporting units 
goodwill is also reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
if a triggering event is determined to occur  we then apply the two step method described above 
determining whether or not a triggering event has occurred requires us to apply judgment 
the final determination of the occurrence of a triggering event is based on our knowledge of the hospitality industry  historical experience  location of the property  market conditions and property specific information available at the time of the assessment 
we realize  however  that the results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts and circumstances available at the time of the analysis 

table of contents long lived assets and definite lived intangibles we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and definite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets to the net book value of the assets when certain triggering events occur 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to earnings

unconsolidated hospitality ventures we record a loss in the value of an unconsolidated hospitality venture that is determined to be an other than temporary decline in our consolidated statements of income as an impairment loss 
we evaluate the carrying value of our unconsolidated hospitality ventures for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the venture to the book value when there is an indication that a loss in value has occurred 
if the fair value is less than the book value of the unconsolidated hospitality venture  we use our judgment to determine if the decline in value is temporary or other than temporary 
the factors we consider when making this determination include  but are not limited to length of time and extent of the decline  loss of value as a percentage of the cost of the unconsolidated hospitality venture  financial condition and near term financial projections of the unconsolidated hospitality venture  our intent and ability to retain the unconsolidated hospitality venture to allow for the recoverability of the lost value  and current economic conditions

stock compensation overview in february  we adopted the ltip as a means of attracting  retaining and incentivizing qualified executives  key employees and nonemployee directors to increase our value and continue our efforts to build and sustain growth 
as of december   we had authorized  shares of class a common stock to be issued under the ltip 
we are required to determine the fair value of the underlying common stock in order to determine the fair value of stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock units rsus  and performance share units psus granted under the ltip 
prior to november   the date our class a common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange  the stock value was determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors according to the ltip based on either an independent valuation or using the price paid for a share of common stock between a willing buyer and willing seller  excluding transactions between us and pritzker family business interests 
the compensation committee determined our per share price to be as follows for each of our award grants between january  and november  grant date common stock fair value may  september  may  october  in accordance with the ltip  we determined the fair value of our common stock as of december  based on an independent valuation performed contemporaneously with the grant date 
the valuation was reviewed and approved by the compensation committee 
in september  approximately four months following the may grant  we made a single grant in connection with the hiring of a new executive 
we continued to use the per share value for our september grant of rsus  as the total shares granted were immaterial and we did not have an updated valuation or an external transaction on which to base an updated share value  as stipulated by our ltip 
in may  we sold additional shares of our common stock to existing stockholders  including third party stockholders  at per share 
the price paid per share was between a willing buyer and seller 
as a result  and in accordance with the ltip  the compensation committee used the per share value as the basis for our may  grant 
the difference between the per share value at may  and the per share value at september  was caused by a combination of factors  but was primarily driven by the decline in our operating performance resulting from the ongoing economic recession and the other financial and economic disruptions that occurred over this period  which adversely affected demand and equity valuations in the hospitality industry 
in accordance with the ltip  we determined the fair value of our common stock based on an independent valuation performed contemporaneously with the grant date 
the valuation was prepared in july as of june  and was reviewed and approved by the compensation committee 

table of contents the following table summarizes by grant date the awards granted since january  under our ltip  as well as the fair value at the date of grant 
grant date award type number granted fair value may sars  may rsus  september rsus  may sars  may rsus  october sars  october rsus  december rsus  march rsus  march sars  may rsus  may sars  september rsus  march sars  march rsus  march psus  june rsus  september rsus  the majority of the awards are determined to be classified as equity awards with the fair value being determined on the grant date 
we have an insignificant portion of the awards which are expected to be settled in cash and therefore are classified as liabilities 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee  which generally equals the vesting period 
we currently have issued service condition awards and performance based awards 
we have elected to use the straight line method of expense attribution for the service condition awards 
the performance based awards were first granted in and vest based on satisfaction of certain performance targets 
the number of psus that will ultimately vest and be paid out in class a common stock will range from to of the target amount stated in each executive officer s award agreement based upon the performance of the company relative to the applicable performance target 
we use the best available estimate of the future achievement of the performance targets and are currently expensing the awards at target over the three year performance period 
the psus will vest at the end of the performance period only if the performance target is met  there is no interim performance metric 
we will continue to access the achievement of the performance targets and may adjust the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize related to the performance based awards 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions 
for sars grants  we use an estimated forfeiture rate of because only a small group of executives has historically received these awards and we have limited historical data on which to base these estimates 
beginning in  as the group of employees receiving rsus expanded  we applied a forfeiture rate to awards received by this larger group of employees 
we monitor the forfeiture activity to ensure that the current estimate continues to be appropriate 
any changes to this estimate will impact the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to any future grants 
we determine the fair value of our stock settled sars using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
under the bsm option pricing model  management is required to make certain assumptions  including assumptions relating to the following expected volatility 
because there is limited trading history for our common stock  we do not have sufficient information available on which to base a reasonable and supportable estimate of the expected volatility 
table of contents of our share price 
consequently  prior to november  the date our class a common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange the expected price volatility for our class a common stock was estimated using the average implied volatility of exchange traded options of our major publicly traded competitors 
we evaluated the five day trailing average implied volatility of exchange traded options with a minimum term of two years 
using the five day average  we applied linear interpolation to determine the implied volatility for an option with a strike price equal to the underlying stock s current trading level 
as of the fourth quarter of  the company changed its methodology for calculating expected volatility 
for the october grant and forward  we are using an average historical volatility of our peer group over a time period consistent with our expected term assumption 
our peer group was determined based upon companies in our industry with similar business models and is consistent with those used to benchmark our executive compensation 
expected term 
the expected term assumption is estimated using the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of each sar  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin topic  share based payment 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yields of us treasury instruments with similar expected lives 
dividend yield 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
generally  the expected volatility and expected term assumptions are the main drivers of value under the bsm option pricing model 
consequently  changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the resulting fair value 
due to the limited scope of these awards  a change in the expected volatility or the expected term assumption would result in an immaterial change to our overall compensation expense 
the fair value of our sars granted since january was estimated using the bsm option pricing model with the following assumptions march  grant may  grant march  grant october  grant may  grant may  grant expected volatility expected life in years risk free interest rate annual dividend yield if  in the future  we determine that another method is more reasonable  or  if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  and  therefore  should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term  the fair value calculated for our stock based compensation could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected term assumptions result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense affects our selling  general and administrative expense 
we expanded the pool of recipients of stock based compensation in and we expect our non cash compensation expense to increase over the next two years as this expanded pool of recipients is expected to receive future awards which will have overlapping vesting periods 
our total unearned compensation under our ltip program was million and million as of december  and  respectively  for sars  million and million as of december  and  respectively  for rsus  and million and as of december  and  respectively  for psus 
we will record these amounts to compensation expense primarily over the next four years with certain awards extending over the next ten years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in certain situations  we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objectives described above  and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we were a party to hedging transactions including the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed below 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes due to our borrowing activities 
our objective is to manage the risk of interest rate changes on the results of operations  cash flows  and the market value of our debt by creating an appropriate balance between our fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate derivative transactions  including interest rate swaps  are entered into to maintain a level of exposure to interest rates which the company deems acceptable 
in december  we entered into three million interest rate swap contracts  each of which expires on august   and effectively converts a total of million of the debt outstanding under our notes to floating rate debt based on three month libor plus a fixed rate component 
in february  we entered into one additional interest rate swap contract  which also expires on august  and effectively converts an additional million of the notes  for a total of million  to floating rate debt based on three month libor plus a fixed rate component 
during  we entered into four additional interest rate swap contracts  each of which expires on august  and  combined  effectively converts an additional million of the notes  for a total of million  to floating rate debt based on three month libor plus a fixed rate component 
the fixed rate component of each swap varies by contract  ranging from to 
the fixed to floating interest rate swaps were designated as a fair value hedge as their objective is to protect the notes against changes in fair value due to changes in the three month libor interest rate 
the swaps were designated as fair value hedges at inception and at december  and were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the fair value of the notes 
at december   the fixed to floating interest rate swaps were recorded within other assets at a value of million  offset by a fair value adjustment to long term debt of million 
at december   the fixed to floating interest rate swaps were recorded within other long term liabilities at a value of million  offset by a fair value adjustment to long term debt of million 
with the addition of the million of interest rate swaps  our fixed percentage of total debt is roughly 
this percentage relates purely to our gross debt balance and does not include the effect of our floating rate cash investments 
we will continue to evaluate our fixed debt as a percentage of total debt and it is possible that this percentage will decrease in the future 
the fair value of the million of interest rate swap contracts was million at december  these hedges were deemed to be highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the fair value of the notes and as such  the impact to our consolidated statements of income loss was insignificant 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in average market interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by million and million  respectively 
during  we entered into treasury lock derivative instruments with million of notional value to hedge a portion of the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with the notes see note  as changes in the benchmark interest rate would result in variability in cash flows related to such debt 
these derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges at inception and were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
changes in the fair value relating to the effective portion of the lock were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the corresponding fair value was included in prepaids and other assets 
we settled the treasury lock derivative instruments at the inception of the loan agreement in august the million loss on the settlement was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized over the remaining life of the notes 
as a result  for the year ended december   we recorded million in incremental interest expense 

table of contents foreign currency exposures and exchange rate instruments we conduct business in various foreign currencies and use foreign currency forward contracts to offset our exposure associated with the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions 
the us dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the forward contracts as of december  and was million and million  respectively  all of which expire within the next twelve months 
we intend to offset the gains and losses related to our intercompany loans and transactions with gains or losses on our foreign currency forward contracts such that there is a negligible effect to net income loss attributable to hyatt hotels corporation 
we expect to continue this practice relating to our intercompany loans and transactions  and may also begin to manage the risks associated with other transactional and translational foreign currency volatility within our business
