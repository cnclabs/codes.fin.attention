our dc dc converters include high density and low density brick converters that are generally used to control power on communications printed circuit boards and also include pol converters that power devices within a iba as well as in other applications 
additional products that include digital control products for motors and a variety of other application specific specialty power products 
critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts may be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  restructuring costs  goodwill impairment  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  sales returns and discounts  warranty costs  uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred tax assets  stock compensation  business combinations and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
other accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements under part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment or at the time of inventory consumption for customers on vendor managed inventory vmi programs because this is the point at which revenue is earned and realizable and the earnings process is complete 
for most shipments  title to shipped goods transfers at the shipping point  so the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer once the product leaves our warehouse 
for shipments in which title transfers at a later date  revenue recognition is delayed 
revenue is only recognized when collectability is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we may charge shipping and handling costs to customers  which are included in revenue 
we offer our distributors a standard agreement which includes payment terms  description of rights to return or exchange product  and price discounts 
under our standard agreement  payment is due within days of shipment of the product to a distributor 
the distributor has a right to return only if we discontinue a product that the distributor has on hand 
the distributor has a right to exchange up to of the dollar value of products purchased within the prior six month period  so long as the distributor is currently purchasing at least the equivalent dollar value in new product 
estimated product exchanges or returns are accrued for at the time of the sale based on historical information in accordance with asc revenue recognition products 
finally  we may give price discounts to a distributor at the time a purchase order is received from the distributor for product that it will sell to a specific customer 
the price discount is available for one year following issuance of the purchase order for items listed on the purchase order 
we accrue for the estimated price discount at the time revenue is recognized 

table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with the standards set forth in asc the standard sets the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party objective evidence tpoe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe or tpoe is available 
we offer remote monitoring services and related hardware to monitor the performance of its inverters  and recognize the related revenue as earned 
the adoption of asu for the fiscal year ending on january  did not materially impact our consolidated statement of operations 
we have a joint venture in china which  along with certain of our contract manufacturers  may purchase raw components and other goods from power one  and sell finished goods back to power one as well as to other third parties 
we record revenue on sales to the joint venture and contract manufacturers only when the components and goods are for sales to third parties 
when the joint venture or contract manufacturers purchase components that will be assembled and sold back to us  no revenue is recorded because the earnings process has not been completed 
warranties the company generally offers its customers a two year warranty on power products sold  although warranty periods may vary by product type and application 
the company offers five and ten year warranty on its renewable energy products and also offers customers extended warranty contracts with terms between five and ten years after the base warranty period expires 
the company accounts for such warranty contracts in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
based on warranty repair costs and the estimated rate of return  the company periodically reviews and adjusts its warranty accrual 
actual warranty repair costs are charged against the reserve balance as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in asc property  plant  and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  it is written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or other information available in the market  depending on the nature of the assets 
methodologies for determining fair value are inherently based on estimates that may change  such as the useful lives of assets and our cash flow forecasts associated with certain assets 
a change in these estimates may result in impairment charges  which would impact our operating results 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets using the methodology prescribed in asc intangibles goodwill and other 
asc requires that we not amortize goodwill  but instead subject it to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
these impairment tests are also dependent on management s forecasts  which frequently change 
a change in our forecasts may result in impairment charges 
asc requires the company to perform a two step impairment test 
under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we are required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and we do not perform the second step 
if the results of the first step impairment test indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit does not exceed its carrying amount  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each august fiscal month 
as a result of the continued decrease in our market capitalization during the first fiscal quarter of  we tested our goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was impaired 
as our carrying value exceeded our estimated fair value as of march   we applied the approach prescribed in asc for determining the impairment amount 
as a result of the interim test  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january  restructuring charges we record restructuring charges in accordance with asc exit or disposal cost obligations and asc compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  as applicable 
asc requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
in accordance with the guidance provided under asc  we accrue for severance expenses prior to notification for termination benefits that are contractual or required by regional labor laws or are pursuant to a substantive plan where the costs are deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
restructuring costs were related to the downsizing of operations and primarily consisted of specific charges that had been incurred or were to be incurred with no future economic benefit 
these charges included costs related to personnel severance  continuing lease obligations for vacant facilities  and certain contract termination penalties and other shutdown costs 
calculation of the restructuring reserves includes management s judgment regarding closed facilities  which include assumptions about the length of time it will take for facilities to be subleased as well as the likely sublease income amount 
changes in these estimates may impact our operating results 
income taxes we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where the company generates a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with asc  income taxes  when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we record uncertain tax positions under the provisions of asc we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the positions 
under these provisions  we must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and will have full knowledge of all relevant information 
for each income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we then assess the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
unrecognized tax positions  if ever recognized in the financial statements  are recorded in the statement of operations as part of the income tax provision 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventory are written down quarterly based on a comparison of on hand quantities to historical and projected usages 
additionally  reserves for non cancelable open purchase orders for components we are obligated to purchase in excess of projected usage  or for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price  are recorded as other accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
calculation of inventory write downs is based on management s assumptions regarding projected usage of each component  which are subject to changes in market demand 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method and also provide a reserve in the aggregate 
our estimates for calculating the aggregate reserve are based on historical information 
any changes to our assumptions or estimates may impact our operating results

the european market was affected by reductions in local government feed in tariffs and government subsidies which negatively influenced customer demand for our renewable energy products 
in addition  competitive pricing pressures negatively impacted the revenue and profitability of our renewable energy sbu 
net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to  million for the fiscal year ended january  from  million for the fiscal year ended january  demand for our renewable energy products increased as we continued to penetrate europe and expand into north america  asia and australia 
during fiscal  we shipped gw versus gw sold during the increased volume was offset by price declines as excess inventories and capacity in the inverter market increased competitive pressures 
feed in tariffs and other related government legislation will continue to drive the revenue levels of the renewable energy solutions business unit as we continue our expansion into high growth markets such as india and north america 
power revenue declined as macroeconomic pressures impacted our customer demand levels in the second half of

these included an aggressive pricing environment for pv inverters as compared to gross margin was also negatively impacted by increased factory overhead including start up costs associated with our new renewable energy factories in north america and china  increased costs related to the establishment of our renewable energy service organization  offset partially by reductions in material costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in selling and general administrative expense for fiscal was primarily related to our investment in the expansion of the renewable energy sbu into north america and asia including sales and marketing teams as well as incremental administrative costs to support the new markets 
in addition  selling expense increased as a result of increased advertising and trade shows in order to support our initiatives to grow market share and revenue 
research and development 
r d expense increased million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  r d expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in r d spending was primarily due to our investment in new product introductions and expansion of r d efforts during as compared with amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets increased by million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of intangible assets acquired upon the acquisition of two renewable energy software firms in order to provide increased value and support to our inverter customers 
restructuring costs and asset impairment 
no restructuring or asset impairment charges were recorded during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
these charges were recorded in accordance with asc exit or disposal cost obligations and asc compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  as applicable

net other income was million for fiscal  compared with net other expense of million for fiscal net other income during fiscal was related to gains on foreign currency transactions of approximately million predominately from fluctuations in the euro which weakened against the us dollar throughout our primary foreign currencies are the euro  the chinese rmb  and the british pound 
net other expense during fiscal was primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal as compared to million recorded during fiscal the provision for income taxes recorded during and are primarily related to taxes recorded at certain of our profitable european locations 
the effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result of the change in geographical mix of pre tax income at our foreign locations and also due to no tax expense recorded on the gain from liquidation of foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate varies significantly from period to period due to the level  mix and seasonality of earnings generated in the us and our various foreign jurisdictions 
under asc  interim reporting of income taxes  we are required to adjust our effective tax rate for each quarter to be consistent with the estimated annual effective tax rate 
jurisdictions with a projected loss where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the calculation of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
applying the provisions of asc could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter  based upon the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections 
although we record deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where we generate a loss for income tax purposes  we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  we may record no tax benefit in jurisdictions where we incur a loss  but record tax expense in jurisdictions where we record taxable income and have no nol carryforward 
as a result  few meaningful comparisons can be made on our consolidated tax rates between periods 
equity in earnings of joint venture

accordingly  all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted into million shares of our common stock on november  we currently anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of to million primarily for manufacturing equipment and process improvements  equipment related to r d and product development  additions and upgrades to our facilities and information technology infrastructure  and other administrative requirements 
however  the amount of these anticipated capital expenditures likely will change during the year based on changes in expected revenues  our financial condition and the general economic climate 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe our existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds that we expect to generate from our operations  will be 
table of contents sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
we will continue to evaluate our liquidity position  and when and if necessary explore alternatives to maximize our position and we may determine to raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities or incurrence of debt 
off balance sheet arrangements 
below we identify and disclose all of our significant off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions 
we do not utilize special purpose entities or have any known financial relationships with other companies special purpose entities 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases where the economic climate is favorable 
the liquidity impact of operating leases generally is not material 
purchase commitments 
we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business 
commitments to purchase inventory at above market prices have been reserved 
certain supply contracts may contain penalty provisions for early termination 
based on current expectations  we do not believe that we are reasonably likely to incur any material amount of penalties under these contracts 
other contractual obligations 
we do not have material financial guarantees that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity 
related parties 
we have entered into certain transactions  or have other arrangements with related parties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments 
as of january   we had not entered into any material non cancelable open purchase orders 
a summary of our future contractual payments related to lease obligations is as follows in millions year ending december  operating leases and thereafter total at january   we also had recorded a tax liability of million related to uncertain tax positions recorded under fin this amount has been excluded from the summary table of contractual obligations and commitments because we could not reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with our fin liabilities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates on outstanding financial debt instruments and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from financial debt instruments that we may enter into 
we may also enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to interest rate changes related to our indebtedness 
however  under no circumstances do we enter into derivative or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
at january  we had no debt borrowings 
foreign currency 
a significant portion of our business operations are conducted in various countries in europe and asia 
as a result  we have a certain degree of market risk with respect to our cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  including inter company transactions 
we may hedge these foreign currency exposures based on our assessment of their significance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in an effort to minimize our balance sheet exposure to cash balances denominated in euro  we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to sell million euro 
as a result of this forward contract which was settled during december  we recorded a foreign currency gain of approximately million in our consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended january  a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency translation rates would result in a reduction of reported net sales of approximately million and a reduction of reported net income before income taxes of approximately million in the fiscal year ended january  a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency translation rates would result in a reduction of reported total assets at january  of approximately million 
these estimates assume an adverse shift in all foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction  actual results may differ materially
