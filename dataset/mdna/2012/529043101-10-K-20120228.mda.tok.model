table of contents page overview liquidity capital resources results of operations off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations overview general 
we are a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the state of maryland 
we operate primarily in one segment  net leased real estate assets  and our primary business is the acquisition  ownership and management of portfolios of single tenanted office  industrial and retail properties  including build to suit transactions 
as of december   we had ownership interests in approximately consolidated real estate properties  located in states and encompassing approximately million square feet 
a majority of these properties are subject to triple net or similar leases  where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs and or cost increases for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and ordinary repairs 
our revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
as a result  growth in revenues and cash flows is directly correlated to our ability to acquire income producing real estate assets  re lease properties that are vacant  or may become vacant  at favorable rental rates and earn fee income 
although there have been signs of recovery in the overall economy  our business continues to be impacted in a number of ways by the uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets  including a need to preserve capital  generate additional liquidity and improve our overall financial flexibility  our ability to find attractive financing  challenges in acquiring suitable property investments and tenant uncertainty with respect to future space needs 
since  we have seen an increase in acquisition opportunities 
in and  we acquired and or engaged in build to suit projects encompassing an aggregate million square feet 
since  we have seen a slight strengthening in the availability of capital  however  it is difficult for us to predict when the economy will fully recover 
in an effort to diversify  we invest across the united states in properties leased to tenants in various industries  including finance insurance  automotive  energy  technology and consumer products 
however  industry declines  to the extent we have concentration  and general economic declines could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to corporate level borrowings  none of which matures in or as of the date of filing this annual report  we have consolidated property specific non recourse mortgage debt with an aggregate of million and million in balloon payments that are to be paid in and  respectively 
business strategy 
our current business strategy is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving our long term growth prospectus 
see business in part i  item of this annual report for a detailed description of our current business strategy 
we believe a positive impact is resulting from our business strategy 
in  and  we reduced our overall consolidated indebtedness by million  million and million  respectively  primarily by repurchasing our exchangeable guaranteed notes and through the sale  transfer or other disposition of properties to third parties and lenders 
we expect our business strategy will enable us to continue to improve our liquidity and strengthen our overall balance sheet 
we believe liquidity and a strong balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise  which will create meaningful shareholder value 
investment trends 
making investments in income producing single tenant real estate assets is one of our primary focuses 
the challenge we face is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising our real estate underwriting criteria 
we believe we have access to acquisition opportunities due to our relationships with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
when we acquire real estate assets  we look for general purpose office and industrial real estate assets subject to a long term net lease which have one or more of the following characteristics a credit worthy tenant  adaptability to a variety of users  including multi tenant use and an attractive geographic location 
during and  acquisition activity decreased as we focused on retiring senior debt and preferred securities 
in response to the compression in capitalization rates  we refocused our efforts into repurchasing our senior debt at what we believe were attractive and secure yields to maturity and disposing of real estate assets in compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to see an increase in our acquisition activity as evidenced by the acquisition of an office property in greenville  south carolina 
our acquisition volume for and consisted primarily of build to suit transactions whereby we engage in build to suit transactions  or provide capital to developers who are engaged in  build to suit transactions and or commit to purchase the property from developers upon completion 
we believe these arrangements offer developers and or tenants access to capital while simultaneously providing us with attractive risk adjusted projected yields 
we generally mitigate our cost exposure by requiring purchase agreements  development agreements and or loan agreements to specify a maximum price and or loan commitment amount prior to execution of the agreement 
cost overruns are generally the responsibility of the developer  or in some cases the prospective tenant 
we believe we perform stringent underwriting procedures to ensure that our investments are not subject to compromise such as  among other items  requiring payment and performance bonds and or completion guarantees from developers and or contractors  engaging third party construction managers and or engineers to monitor construction progress and quality  only hiring developers with a proven history of performance  requiring developers to provide financial statements and in some cases personal guarantees from principals  acquiring detailed plans and constructions budgets  requiring a long term tenant lease to be executed prior to funding  and leveling liens on the property to the extent of construction funding

joint venture investment 
acquired from nls 
deed in lieu of foreclosure 
we  through lender subsidiaries  invest in debt investments secured by real estate assets  which we feel comfortable owning for our investment should the borrower default for reasons other than an underlying tenant default or are necessary for an efficient deposition of our equity interest in the property 
during the first quarter of  through a lender subsidiary  we loaned million to the buyer in connection with the sale of a vacant industrial property for million 
the loan is secured by the property  bears interest at and matures in january in  we  through a lender subsidiary  made a million mezzanine loan secured by a pledge of all equity interests in the entities which own two  to be constructed distribution facilities 
the loan was scheduled to mature in june and had an interest rate of for the first year and for the second year 
the loan was fully satisfied in november for a payment of million which included accrued interest and yield maintenance 
during and  through a lender subsidiary  we made a mortgage loan on an office building in schaumburg  illinois  which matured in january but could have been extended one additional year by the borrower for a basis point fee 
the mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  the property is leased through december  for an average annual rent of million 
our lender subsidiary may be obligated to fund an additional million for tenant improvement costs 
the borrower is currently in default 
we believe the office building has an estimated fair value in excess of our investment and we have initiated foreclosure proceedings 
one of our lender subsidiaries also made a million loan secured by a combination of limited partner interests in entities that owned  and second mortgage liens or mortgage liens against  five medical facilities 
this loan was guaranteed by a parent entity and principal and initially matured in december and required payments of interest only at a rate of through february and thereafter 
the borrower prepaid an aggregate million in december and february in connection with the sale of certain collateral  and repaid the remaining million in december despite the current economic uncertainty  we have seen an increase in our acquisition pipeline  mostly consisting of build to suit transactions 
we have several commitments and letters of intent for future acquisitions as of the first quarter of  and we anticipate continued acquisition activity for however  we can provide no assurances that any of these transactions will be consummated 
leasing trends 
re leasing properties that are currently vacant or as leases expire at favorable effective rates is one of our primary asset management focuses 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are the period of time required to find a new tenant  whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  the significance of leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and the payment of capital expenditures and operating costs such as real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance with no offsetting revenue 
our property owner subsidiaries try to mitigate these risks by staying in close contact with our tenants during the lease term in order to assess their current and future occupancy needs  maintaining relationships with local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
however  no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
generally  a tenant in a single tenant office property commences lease extension discussions well in advance of lease expiration 
if the lease has a year or less remaining until expiration  there is a high likelihood that the tenant will not extend the lease 
if a property cannot be re let to a single user and the property can be adapted to multi tenant use  our property owner subsidiary determines whether the costs of adapting the property to multi tenant use outweigh the benefit of funding operating costs while searching for a single tenant 
certain of the long term leases on properties in which we have an ownership interest contain provisions that may mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling our property owner subsidiaries to receive scheduled fixed base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the leases on the single tenant properties in which we have an ownership interest require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the leases on single tenant properties in which we have an ownership interest are generally structured in a way that minimizes responsibility for capital improvements 
since  tenants have been more aggressive in lease and lease renewal negotiations with respect to rental rate  tenant improvement allowances and landlord responsibilities 
as a result  the obligations of our property owner subsidiaries on new leases and newly renewed or extended leases have generally increased 
we continue to monitor the credit of tenants of properties in which we have an interest 
under current bankruptcy law  a tenant can generally assume or reject a lease within a certain number of days of filing its bankruptcy petition 
if a tenant rejects the lease  a landlord s damages are generally limited to the greater of one year s rent and the rent for  of the remaining term of the lease not to exceed three years rent 
during  due to economic conditions  three of our property owner subsidiaries each conveyed a property to its lender and or to a bankruptcy estate as a result of the single tenant vacating its property and there being no viable leasing prospects 
although there were no such conveyances during and  one of our property owner subsidiaries conveyed a vacant property in tulsa  oklahoma to its lender in january our property owner subsidiaries may convey properties to lenders or the property owner subsidiary may declare bankruptcy in the future if a property owner subsidiary is unable to refinance  re let or sell its vacated property or if a tenant renews at a lower rent or a new tenant pays a lower rent 
impairment charges 
during  and  we incurred impairment charges on our assets  of million  million and million  respectively  due primarily to a deterioration in economic conditions since the acquisition of such assets 
impairments on real estate assets in discontinued operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively  as the assets were ultimately sold or foreclosed upon below their carrying value 
the assets that were sold were generally non core or non performing assets 
we used the net proceeds from these sales to primarily deleverage our balance sheet 
in addition  we incurred million and million of impairment charges on real estate assets classified in continuing operations in and  respectively 
these real estate assets were primarily non core assets including retail properties  under performing and multi tenant properties acquired in the newkirk merger 
in  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge on a non consolidated investment acquired in the newkirk merger due to a change in our estimate of net proceeds upon liquidation of the joint venture 
we recognized other than temporary impairments on two of our investments in non consolidated entities in of million  consisting of lex win concord and another joint venture 
concord experienced declines in the fair value of its loan securities consistent with liquidity concerns impacting the commercial bond and real estate markets and the overall economy beginning in concord recorded significant other than temporary impairment charges during and as a result of these charges and other factors  we recorded other than temporary impairments of million on our investment in lex win concord during  reducing the carrying value of our investment to zero 
in addition  during  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture acquired in the newkirk merger due to the expiration of the net lease on the hotel asset owned by the joint venture 
we subsequently sold our interest in this joint venture for a nominal amount to another partner in the joint venture 
we incurred loan losses on our loans receivable during and during  we recorded a million loan loss on a loan receivable as the tenant supporting the collateral declared bankruptcy and announced liquidation proceedings 
during the first quarter of  we agreed to the discounted payoffs of two loans receivable with an aggregate carrying value of million 
during  we wrote the loans receivable down to the aggregate agreed upon discounted payoff amount of million  which approximated fair value  and recognized a loan loss reserve of million 
in addition  investments in debt securities were sold for million during and we realized a loss of million 
the proceeds from these transactions were used to reduce corporate level debt 
given the continued uncertainty in general economic conditions  we cannot estimate if we will incur  or the amount of  future impairment charges on our assets

critical accounting policies 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which require our management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
a summary of our significant accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this annual report and incorporated herein 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies  which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting 
the financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our consolidated subsidiaries 
we consolidate our wholly owned subsidiaries  partnerships and joint ventures which we control through voting rights or similar rights or by means other than voting rights if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  which we refer to as a vie 
entities which we do not control and entities which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are generally accounted for by the equity method 
significant judgments and assumptions are made by us to determine whether an entity is a vie such as those regarding an entity s equity at risk  the entity s equity holders obligations to absorb anticipated losses and other factors 
in addition  the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie requires judgment to determine the party that has power over the significant activities of the vie and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
judgments and estimates 
our management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our management s best estimates and judgment 
our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions 
our management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate 
the most significant estimates made include the recoverability of accounts receivable  allocation of property purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the determination of vies and entities that should be consolidated  the determination of impairment of long lived assets  loans receivable and equity method investments  valuation and impairment of assets held by equity method investees  valuation of derivative financial instruments and the useful lives of long lived assets 
purchase accounting and acquisition of real estate 
the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of fair value adjustments for assumed mortgage debt related to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and improvements and fixtures and equipment is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building and improvements based on our management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by our management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  our management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
our management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and management s estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods and bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationship values  is measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property over the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationship values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationships is amortized to expense over the applicable lease term plus expected renewal periods 
acquisition  development and construction arrangements 
we evaluate loans receivable where we participate in residual profits through loan provisions or other contracts to ascertain whether we have the same risks and rewards as an owner or joint venture partner 
this evaluation takes significant judgment 
where we conclude that such arrangements are more appropriately treated as an investment in real estate  we record such loans receivable as an equity investment in real estate under construction 
revenue recognition 
we recognize lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent if the renewals are not reasonably assured 
in those instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when we determine that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
the lease incentive is recorded as a deferred expense and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight line basis over the respective lease term 
determining if a tenant allowance is a lease incentive requires significant judgment 
we recognize lease termination payments as a component of rental revenue in the period received  provided that there are no further obligations under the lease  otherwise the lease termination payment is amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining obligation period 
all above market lease assets  below market lease liabilities and deferred rent assets or liabilities for terminated leases are charged against or credited to rental revenue in the period the lease is terminated 
all other capitalized lease costs and lease intangibles are accelerated via amortization expense to the date of termination 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized based on the specific timing of the sale as measured against various criteria related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
to the extent we sell a property and retain a partial ownership interest in the property  we recognize gain to the extent of the third party ownership interest 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections from our tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that we have identified 
impairment of real estate 
we evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible real estate assets for possible impairment when an event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset 
if such cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
impairment of equity method investments 
we assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below its carrying value is other than temporary 
the assessment of impairment is highly subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about our intent and ability to recover our investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment  including the level of our involvement therein  among other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated value of the investment 
loans receivable 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether the loan is impaired 
a loan is considered to be impaired  when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
significant judgments are required in determining whether impairment has occurred 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable current market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
interest on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis 
fair value measurements 
we follow the guidance in fasb accounting standards codification  which we refer to as asc  topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which we refer to as topic  to determine the fair value of financial and non financial investments 
topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities  level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets  but corroborated by market data  and level unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs and the lowest priority to level inputs 
in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk  where applicable  in our assessment of fair value 
the accounting for these critical accounting policies and implementation of accounting guidance issued in the future involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
liquidity general 
since becoming a public company  our principal sources of liquidity have been undistributed cash flows generated from our investments  the public and private equity and debt markets  including issuances of op units  property specific debt  corporate level borrowings  commitments from co investment partners and proceeds from the sales of our investments 
our ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon our existing leverage  the value of the assets we are attempting to leverage and general economic and credit market conditions  which may be outside of management s control or influence 
cash flows 
we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our secured term loan and secured revolving credit facility  and our other principal sources of liquidity  will be available to provide the necessary capital required to fund our operations and allow us to grow 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows totaled million for  million for and million for the underlying drivers that impact working capital and therefore cash flows from operations are the timing of the collection of rents and tenant reimbursements  loan interest payments from borrowers  and advisory fees  and the payment of interest on mortgage debt and operating and general and administrative costs 
we believe the net lease structure of the leases encumbering a majority of the properties in which we have an interest enhances cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant 
collection and timing of tenant rents is closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program 
net cash provided by used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by investing activities related primarily to proceeds from the sale of properties  collection of loans receivable  distributions from non consolidated entities in excess of accumulated earnings  proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities and changes in escrow deposits and restricted cash 
cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties  co investment programs  loans receivable  an increase in deferred leasing costs  deposits and restricted cash 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common shares  net  exercise of employee common share options  contributions from noncontrolling interests  non recourse mortgages and corporate borrowings  offset by dividend and distribution payments  net  repurchases of equity interests  forward equity commitment payments  net  an increase in deferred financing costs and debt payments and repurchases 
public and private equity and debt markets 
we access the public and private equity and debt markets when we believe conditions are favorable and have a compelling use of proceeds 
during and  we issued approximately million and million common shares  respectively  raising net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively  in public common share offerings 
during  and  we issued approximately million  million and million common shares under our direct share purchase plan raising net proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we primarily used these proceeds to retire indebtedness 
during  we issued an aggregate million of exchangeable guaranteed notes due in since  we repurchased and retired million original principal amount of the notes for million in cash and million common shares having a value at issuance of million or per share 
the remaining notes were repurchased by us and retired in january pursuant to a holder repurchase option 
during  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible guaranteed notes 
the notes pay interest semi annually in arrears and mature in january the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes in january  january and january for cash equal to of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
we may not redeem any notes prior to january  except to preserve our reit status 
thereafter  we may redeem the notes for cash equal to of the principal of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
as of the date of filing this annual report  the notes have a conversion rate of common shares per  principal amount of the notes  representing a conversion price of approximately per common share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances for cash  common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at our election 
during  we repurchased and retired approximately million series b preferred shares and approximately million series c preferred shares at a discount to the respective liquidation preferences 
during  we converted approximately million shares of our series c preferred shares by issuing million common shares 
during  we entered into a forward equity commitment to purchase million of our common shares at a price of per share 
we prepaid million of the million purchase price during and  agreed to make floating payments during the term of the forward purchase at libor plus basis points per annum and we retained all cash dividend payments 
we settled the commitment in october for a cash payment of approximately million and retired approximately million common shares 
we may access these markets in the future to implement our business strategy including capital to fund future growth 
however  the continued general economic uncertainty and the volatility in these markets makes accessing these market challenging 
upreit structure 
our upreit structure permits us to effect acquisitions by issuing op units to a property owner as a form of consideration in exchange for the property 
substantially all outstanding op units are redeemable by the holder at certain times on a one op unit for approximately common shares or  at our election  with respect to certain op units  cash 
substantially all outstanding op units require us to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units equal to the dividends paid to our common shareholders on an as redeemed basis and the remaining op units have stated distributions in accordance with their respective partnership agreement 
to the extent that our dividend per share is less than a stated distribution per unit per the applicable partnership agreement  the stated distributions per unit are reduced by the percentage reduction in our dividend 
we are party to a funding agreements with our operating partnerships under which we may be required to fund distributions made on account of op units 
no op units have a liquidation preference 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests should be expected to decrease increase  as such op units are redeemed for our common shares 
as of december   there was a total of approximately million op units outstanding other than op units held by us 
of this total  approximately million are held by related parties 
as a result of the general deterioration in real estate values since  few sellers of real estate are seeking op units as a form of consideration 
property specific debt 
as of december   our property owner subsidiaries have related balloon payments of million and million to be paid during and  respectively 
with respect to mortgages encumbering properties where the expected lease rental revenues are sufficient to provide an estimated property value in excess of the mortgage balance  we believe our property owner subsidiaries have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet these obligations through future cash flow from operations  the credit markets and  if determined appropriate by us  a capital contribution from us from either cash on hand million at december   borrowing capacity on our new secured term loan currently million and our new secured revolving credit facility currently million 
in the event that the estimated property value is less than the mortgage balance  the mortgages encumbering the properties in which we have an interest are generally non recourse to us and the property owner subsidiaries  such that a property owner subsidiary may  if appropriate  satisfy a mortgage obligation by transferring title of the property to the lender or permitting a lender to foreclose 
we expect to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as we believe that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with the terms of a lease  our cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
however  the current economic environment has impacted the ability of our property owner subsidiaries to obtain property specific debt on favorable terms 
in  property specific mortgage lending nearly ceased 
since then  the number of lenders and available loan proceeds have diminished significantly 
in addition  the required loan to value ratios have decreased and the covenants  including required reserve amounts  have increased 
in  a property owner subsidiary  obtained a five year  million  interest only  non recourse mortgage loan on an industrial property in byhalia  mississippi 
during  one of our property owner subsidiaries obtained an million  fully amortizing  approximate nine year  non recourse mortgage loan on its north berwick  maine property and another one of our property owner subsidiaries obtained a million  interest only  non recourse mortgage loan on its greenville south carolina property  which matures in january in addition  one of our property owner subsidiaries obtained a million non recourse mortgage loan on its salt lake city  utah property 
the property was subsequently sold  and the loan was assumed by the buyer 
in august  one of our property owner subsidiaries refinanced a million  non recourse mortgage loan on a property in fishers  indiana which was scheduled to mature in april  with an million  non recourse mortgage loan which matures in august during  a property owner subsidiary  suspended debt service payments on a vacant office property in tulsa  oklahoma 
the property was conveyed to the lender in january during  one of our property owner subsidiaries suspended debt service payments on the mortgage encumbering its property leased to circuit city stores  inc in richmond  virginia following the lease being rejected in the tenant s bankruptcy and subsequent vacancy 
the non recourse loan had a balance of million at that time 
the property was conveyed to the lender in a foreclosure sale during the third quarter of during  one of our property owner subsidiaries suspended debt service payments on a vacant property in plymouth  michigan which had an outstanding mortgage balance of million 
the property was conveyed through a foreclosure sale to the lender in december in addition  one of our property owner subsidiaries did not make an million balloon payment on a property in houston  texas which was due in october the property owner subsidiary declared bankruptcy in december and the property and related debt were assumed by the bankruptcy estate 
there are significant risks associated with conveying properties to lenders through foreclosure which are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
corporate borrowings 
in january  we procured a million secured term loan from wells fargo bank  national association  as agent 
the secured term loan matures in january the secured term loan requires regular payments of interest only at an interest rate dependent on our leverage ratio  as defined  as follows plus libor if our leverage ratio is less than  plus libor if our leverage ratio is between and  plus libor if our leverage ratio is between and  and plus libor if our leverage ratio exceeds 
upon the date when we obtain an investment grade debt rating from at least two of standard poor s  moody s and fitch  the interest rate under the secured term loan will be dependent on our debt rating 
we may not prepay any outstanding borrowings under the secured term loan facility through january   but may prepay outstanding borrowings anytime thereafter  however at a premium for the next three years 
effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix libor at on million of borrowings under the secured term loan for seven years 
as of the date of filing of this annual report  million was outstanding and we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the secured term loan agreement 
in addition  in january  we refinanced our secured million revolving credit facility procured in january with keybank  as agent  with a million secured revolving credit facility 
the new secured revolving facility bears interest at plus libor if our leverage ratio  as defined  is less than  plus libor if our leverage ratio is between and  plus libor if our leverage ratio is between and and plus libor if the leverage ratio exceeds 
the new secured revolving credit facility matures in january  but can be extended to january at our option 
with the consent of the lenders  we can increase the size of the secured revolving credit facility by million  for a total facility size of million by adding properties to the borrowing base and admitting additional lenders 
the new revolving credit facility and new term loan are secured by ownership interest pledges and guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries that own interests in a borrowing base of properties 
as of the date of filing of this annual report  million was outstanding on the new secured revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the secured revolving credit facility agreement 
in march  we obtained million and million original principal amount secured term loans from keybank 
the loans were scheduled to mature in and required payments of interest only at libor plus basis points  however  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which fixed the interest rate at 
as of december   million and million were respectively outstanding on this secured term loan and we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in each loan document 
the loans and interest rate swap were fully satisfied in january with proceeds from the new secured term loan and the new secured revolving credit facility discussed above 
during  we issued million in trust preferred securities  which bear interest at a fixed rate of through april and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus basis points through maturity 
these securities are classified as debt  due in and redeemable by us commencing april as of december  and  there are million outstanding 
while property specific mortgages have become harder to obtain  corporate level borrowings have generally been available and we expect this to continue to be the case in the near future 
co investment programs 
we believe that entering into co investment programs and joint ventures with institutional investors and other real estate companies is a good way to access private capital while mitigating our risk in certain assets and increasing our return on equity to the extent we earn management or other fees 
however  investments in co investment programs and joint ventures limit our ability to make investment decisions unilaterally relating to the assets and limit our ability to deploy capital 
if we continue to grow  we expect to enter into co investment programs and joint ventures primarily with respect to assets that we ordinarily would not have invested in 
capital recycling 
part of our strategy to effectively manage our balance sheet involves pursuing and executing well on property dispositions and recycling of capital 
during  we monetized properties for a gross price of million 
these proceeds were used to retire indebtedness encumbering properties in which we have an interest and make investments 
liquidity needs 
our principal liquidity needs are the contractual obligations set forth under the heading contractual obligations  below  and the payment of dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of op units 
as of december   we and our property owner subsidiaries  in the aggregate  had approximately billion of indebtedness  consisting of mortgages and notes payable outstanding  convertible guaranteed notes  exchangeable guaranteed notes repurchased subsequent to year end pursuant to a holder option and trust preferred securities  with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the ability of a property owner subsidiary to make debt service payments depends upon the rental revenues of its property and its ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  or access capital from us or other sources 
a property owner subsidiary s ability to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  its equity in the mortgaged property  the financial condition and the operating history of the mortgaged property  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
if we are unable to satisfy our contractual obligations and other operating costs with our cash flow from operations  we intend to use borrowings under our new secured term loan and secured revolving credit facility and proceeds from issuances of equity or debt securities 
if a property owner subsidiary is unable to satisfy its contractual obligations and other operating costs  it may default on its obligations and lose its assets in foreclosure or through bankruptcy proceedings 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we expect to continue paying regular dividends to our shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  we generally intend to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio or we may issue common shares in lieu of cash dividends if permitted under the code  reserving such amounts as we consider necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in our portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as our board of trustees considers appropriate 
we paid approximately million in cash dividends to our common and preferred shareholders in although our property owner subsidiaries receive the majority of our base rental payments on a monthly basis  we intend to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by us in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
capital resources general 
due to the net lease structure  our property owner subsidiaries historically have not incurred significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties in which we have an interest 
however  particularly since  as leases have expired  our property owner subsidiaries have incurred costs in extending the existing tenant leases  re tenanting the properties with a single tenant  or converting the property to multi tenant use 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
single tenant properties 
we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures at the properties in which we have an interest that are subject to net leases since the tenants at these properties generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs 
however  at certain properties subject to net leases  our property owner subsidiaries are responsible for replacement and or repair of certain capital items 
at certain single tenant properties that are not subject to a net lease  our property owner subsidiaries have a level of property operating expense responsibility 
multi tenant properties 
primarily as a result of non renewals at single tenant net lease properties  we have interests in multi tenant properties in our consolidated portfolio 
while tenants are generally responsible for increases over base year expenses  our property owner subsidiaries are responsible for the base year expenses and capital expenditures at these properties 
vacant properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  our property owner subsidiary would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
if a property is vacant for an extended period of time  our property owner subsidiary may incur substantial capital expenditure costs to re tenant the property 
property expansions 
under certain leases  tenants have the right to expand the facility located on a property in which we have an interest 
in the past our property owner subsidiary has generally funded  and in the future our property owner subsidiary intends to generally fund  these property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which was  and will be  funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
ground leases 
the tenants of properties in which we have an interest generally pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to our property owner subsidiary as increased rent 
however  our property owner subsidiaries are responsible for these payments under certain leases and at vacant properties 
environmental matters 
based upon management s ongoing review of the properties in which we have an interest  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of these properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  changes in law  the conduct of tenants or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the properties in which we have an interest  will not expose us to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the tenants of properties in which we have an interest 
results of operations year ended december  compared with december  the increase in total gross revenues in of million is attributable to a million increase in rental revenue and a million increase in tenant reimbursements due to an increase in acquisitions and leasing activity and an increase of million in advisory and incentive fees relating to third party managed account return hurdles being met

in addition  we recognized a million impairment charge in on a property due to operational considerations with respect to the property and a million other than temporary impairment on a bond investment 
the change in the benefit provision for income taxes of million was primarily the result of the write off of a deferred tax liability relating to the transfer of certain assets from our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary to the reit itself in the increase in equity in earnings losses of non consolidated entities of million is primarily due to million earned from our investment in lw sofi llc  million earned on a new non consolidated entity  pemlex llc  prior to consolidation and cash distributions of million received from our investments in concord related entities 
discontinued operations represents properties sold or held for sale 
the total loss from discontinued operations increased million due to a decrease in gains on sale of properties of million and an increase in debt satisfaction charges  net of million  offset by a decrease in impairment charges of million and an increase in income from discontinued operations of million 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased million primarily due to an increase in impairment charges incurred on noncontrolling interest properties 
net loss attributable to common shareholders increased million primarily due to the items discussed above 
the increase in net income or decrease in net loss in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by us 
without acquisitions  the sources of growth in net income are limited to index adjusted rents such as the consumer price index  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and variable rate indebtedness and by controlling other variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates and tenant monetary defaults and the other risks described in this annual report

as of december   we had investments in various real estate entities with varying structures 
the real estate investments owned by these entities are generally financed with non recourse debt 
non recourse debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the assets collateralized by the debt 
the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the members or partners of the borrower  except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents 
these exceptions generally relate to bad boy acts  including breaches of material representations

concord debt holdings llc and cdh cdo llc 
concord and cdh cdo are two co investment programs with inland concord and winthrop  to acquire and originate loans secured  directly and indirectly  by real estate assets 
concord initially sought to produce a stable income stream from its investments in loan assets and loan securities by managing credit risk and interest rate risk 
however  the disruption in the capital and credit markets increased margin calls on concord s repurchase agreements 
furthermore  the ability to issue cdos and the availability of new financing has effectively been eliminated  making the execution of concord s strategy unfeasible at this time 
concord began experiencing declines in the fair value of its loan securities in the fourth quarter of consistent with liquidity concerns impacting the commercial bond and real estate markets and the overall economy 
as a result concord has recorded significant other than temporary impairment charges 
primarily due to the continued deterioration in the value of concord s loan and bond portfolio  a margin call received by concord and potential additional margin calls  the preferred member s failure to fund a requested concord capital call  an increase in concord borrower defaults  concord s debt covenant violations and the distressed sale of assets and potential sale of assets at distressed levels to satisfy margin calls and amendments to lender agreements  we determined during the first half of that our investment in concord had suffered a significant decrease in value and that ultimately our investment should be valued at zero 
as a result  we recorded an aggregate of million in other than temporary impairment charges during we have made no additional contributions and we recognize future income from concord and cdh cdo on the cash basis 
our investment in these ventures is valued at zero 
we are only obligated to fund capital calls for new investments to the extent of management fees we receive from concord and cdh cdo 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  s and thereafter total notes payable interest payable fixed rate operating lease obligations includes balloon payments 
amounts shown exclude debt discounts of   and  thereafter and exclude million in outstanding letters of credit 
includes ground lease payments and office rents 
amounts disclosed do not include rents that adjust to fair market value 
in addition certain ground lease payments due under bond leases allow for a right of offset between the lease obligation and the debt service and accordingly are not included 
in addition  we guarantee certain tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions on behalf of certain property owner subsidiaries when required by the related tenant or lender 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our variable rate debt and fixed rate debt 
as of december  and  we had no consolidated variable rate indebtedness not subject to an interest rate swap agreement 
during and  our variable rate indebtedness had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher  our interest expense for and would have been increased by approximately thousand and million  respectively 
as of december  and  our consolidated fixed rate debt  including discontinued operations  was approximately billion and billion  respectively  which represented of total long term indebtedness 
for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values 
the following fair values were determined using the interest rates that we believe our outstanding fixed rate debt would warrant as of december  and are indicative of the interest rate environment as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we estimate that the fair value of our fixed rate debt is billion as of december  our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of the date of filing this annual report  we have one interest rate swap agreement in our consolidated portfolio
