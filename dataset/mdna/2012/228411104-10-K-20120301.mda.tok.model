table of contents we currently and primarily use the websites www 
hallmarkchannel 
com and www 
hallmarkmoviechannel 
com to promote the two networks  their programming and to provide information to consumers 
these websites promote major programming events  such as original movie premieres and program acquisitions  as well as provide information regarding the networks regular programs 
further  the sites provide a venue for viewer participation in the networks sweepstakes  promotions and community areas 
the sites have advertiser imaging  including banner messages and video content 
we also promote our programming and promotion activities on social networking sites  such as facebook and twitter 
network operations our programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
our programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the marketing and creative services departments to create the distinctive appearance of our networks 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our networks begins with the acquisition of programming and original production 
our staff or third parties review all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
our employees are typically responsible for the creation of on air promotional segments  interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  but are occasionally outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the networks 
occasionally  these interstitials are sponsored by advertisers  resulting in additional advertising revenue 
our scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales  research  distribution and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the effectiveness of programming content and sequence 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be distributed to the subscribers of the networks 
network delivery we deliver the daily log  electronic files and digital tapes of hallmark channel and hallmark movie channel programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in los angeles  california  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed 
the networks are compiled in high definition hd and then the same versions of the networks are converted to standard definition sd 
the los angeles facility transmits the combined signals to a satellite transponder that covers the united states 
the transponder transmits the signal back to cable head end facilities  telcos and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our networks to their subscribers

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our networks compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television networks  broadcast television networks and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
our networks compete with other general entertainment programming from broadcast networks including  tnt  tcm  usa network  hgtv  tv land  lifetime  lifetime movie network  own  abc family and other similarly targeted networks 
we compete with these networks for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all networks for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more network capacity 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new networks on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  basic analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog network space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following programming 
we have established a track record of providing high quality family programming 
our programming includes high quality original movies  original lifestyle programming  as well as popular television series such as frasier and golden girls 

table of contents pay television networks branded with the well known hallmark name 
our networks are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn affects ratings and advertising revenue 
dual revenue stream 
we generate our revenue through subscriber fees under long term distribution agreements and robust advertising sales driven by our attractive audience demographic and trusted content and brand association 
broad distribution 
our networks are widely distributed throughout the united states  with hallmark channel reaching approximately of the united states pay television audience  which provides us with the necessary reach to attract advertisers 
experienced management 
members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating networks 
they have held senior positions at such companies as abc  fox family  discovery channel  mtv and twentieth television 
competitive risks we believe that our primary competitive risks include the following two networks distributed domestically 
we operate only two networks 
many of our competitors have more than two networks and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple networks 
entertainment programming 
our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising 
our ratings are a significant and generally positive factor 
nevertheless  our competitors include networks with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affect rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the networks to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our networks research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our networks market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
the performance of both our channels is tracked daily  weekly  monthly  and quarterly through internal tracking established in july of using the nielsen ratings service and a number of other services useful in obtaining information on viewers of our channels

risk factors risk factors and forward looking statements the discussion set forth in this form k contains statements concerning potential future events 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions by our management  as of the date of this form k  including  without limitation  assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by us 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes  or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
if any of management s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  our actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
we will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our common stock and publicly traded debt could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business incurred net losses from inception through september   and may incur losses in the future 
our business has a history of net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders equity of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain an operating profit or a positive cash flow 
if we are not able to do so  the trading price of our common stock and publicly traded debt may fall significantly 
to continue to be profitable before interest expense and to continue to generate a positive cash flow  we must maintain or increase the positive margin of our advertising and subscriber revenue over our i programming expenses  ii selling  general and administrative expenses and iii marketing expenses 
this will require  among other things  maintaining or increasing the distribution of our networks  attracting younger viewers to our networks  attracting more advertisers  increasing our ratings and maintaining or increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 

table of contents our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we and the guarantors of our notes may incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness 
as of december   we had total debt outstanding of approximately million  of which million was secured  and borrowing availability of approximately million under our senior secured credit facilities 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  such as limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs  acquisitions  capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes  limiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged  as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions  restricting us from making strategic acquisitions  developing properties or exploiting business opportunities  restricting the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness  including  in the case of certain indebtedness of subsidiaries  certain covenants that restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  exposing us to potential events of default if not cured or waived under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results  increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of our products  and limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry and in our customers industries 
in addition to our debt service obligations  our operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis 
our ability to make scheduled debt payments and to fund capital and non capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties  as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business  depends on our financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  competitive  legal and other factors 
subject to the restrictions in our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes  we and the guarantors may incur significant additional indebtedness  including additional secured indebtedness 
although the terms of our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant 
if new debt is added to our and the guarantors current debt levels  the risks described above could increase 
our liquidity could be dependent on external funds 
unanticipated significant expenses or any developments that hamper our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue may result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 

table of contents we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness  including the notes  and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon  among other things our future financial and operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  and our future ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facilities  the availability of which depends on  among other things  our complying with the covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under our senior secured credit facilities in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness  including the notes 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations  sell equity  and or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt  in order to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all 
our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes may restrict  or market or business conditions may limit  our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options 
furthermore  any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  make certain payments on debt that is subordinated or secured on a junior basis  make certain investments  sell certain assets  create liens on certain assets  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  and designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 

table of contents any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities 
any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes 
upon a default  unless waived  the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments  cease making further loans  foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation 
holders of the notes would also have the ability ultimately to force us into bankruptcy or liquidation  subject to the indenture governing the notes 
in addition  a default under either our senior secured credit facilities or the indenture governing the notes would trigger a cross default under our other agreements and could trigger a cross default under any agreements governing our future indebtedness 
our operating results may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements 
we depend on distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries to fulfill certain of our obligations  including our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities and notes 
the creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us 
substantially all of our assets are held through our subsidiaries 
we depend on these subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow 
the creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary s obligations to them  when due and payable  before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to us 
thus  our ability to service our debt obligations  including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes when due  depends on our subsidiaries ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligations  other than under the guarantee of the notes  to make any funds available to us 
if we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness  we may not be able to make payments on the notes 
any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  including a default under our senior secured credit facilities  that is not waived by the required holders of such indebtedness  could leave us unable to pay principal  premium  if any  or interest on the notes and could substantially decrease the market value of the notes 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest on such indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants  including financial and operating covenants  in the instruments governing our indebtedness  including our senior secured credit facilities  we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness 
in the event of such default  the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with any accrued and unpaid interest  the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments  cease making further loans  foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
if our operating performance declines  we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default 
if we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek waivers  we may not be able to obtain waivers from the required lenders thereunder 

table of contents most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
these clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees  launch support  local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial and other terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television network providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability or maintaining a positive cash flow and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and publicly traded debt 
in addition  our delivery of the networks continues to be impacted by industry developments 
one potentially significant factor is the continued growth of time shifting digital video recording devices dvrs 
dvrs heighten the impact of competition as viewers are able to increase their access to what they consider to be new  compelling content 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve improved results 
if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i a continued decline in viewer ratings mentioned above  ii the current economic environment that presents uncertainty regarding the condition of the advertising marketplace and the financial health of many industry segments and individual companies  including those which advertise on our networks  iii we may be unable to reduce our average viewer age to be within our target audience of viewers between the ages of and  iv we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  v our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  vi the advancement of technologies such as dvrs may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media 
table of contents in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and vii we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots to fulfill guaranteed delivery numbers which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our networks and our number of subscribers 
hallmark cards controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark cards  through hcc  its wholly owned subsidiary  owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
this control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of common stock and publicly traded debt 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and publicly traded debt could suffer  and our business could suffer 
in addition  the control that hallmark cards and or these specific wholly owned affiliates may exert over us  either directly or indirectly  could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark  which could harm our business 
pursuant to license agreements  we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  llc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our networks 
hallmark licensing  llc extended the term of the license agreements for an additional period that terminates on the earlier of i july  and ii the later of x the expiration or termination of the credit agreement and y the redemption of all of the notes  subject to any earlier termination of such license agreements pursuant to the respective terms of such license agreements 
we believe that the use of this trademark is important for our networks due to the substantial name recognition and favorable characteristics associated with the name in the united states 
despite hallmark licensing  llc s efforts to protect its trademark in the name hallmark  third parties may infringe or misappropriate the name hallmark  which could harm our business 
further  in the event of bankruptcy proceedings relating to hallmark licensing  llc or hallmark cards  a bankruptcy court could conclude that the license agreements are executory contracts and  subject to certain legal requirements  the bankruptcy trustee may either assume or reject the license agreements 
rejection of the license agreements could prevent us from continuing to use the hallmark name 
the loss of our license rights to use the name hallmark could substantially harm our business 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced outages  delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 

table of contents if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  including the following failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investors in any quarter  economic conditions that adversely affect our advertising rates or our number of subscribers  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  perceptions by the investing community or our customers with respect to the prospects of our company or our industry  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure by us to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding common stock  only million shares approximately  are held by non affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s common stock 
risks relating to our industry the recent change in the television rating system in the united states could reduce our networks revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies and ongoing changes in the us population 
nielsen is currently in the process of incorporating us census results into its sample 
this process will continue through spring summer as the us bureau of the census data releases extend through june as the impact of the changes continue to take effect  our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the nature of any changes to their measurement systems 
additionally  in may nielsen began to issue credit for extended screen ratings for television programming viewed on in home personal computers  which to date  has added virtually no additional viewing due to the nielsen s current commercial qualifiers 
we continue to factor the new rating information into our 
table of contents advertising rates as nielsen continues its process of incorporating us census results and modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our networks revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television networks and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television networks  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the entertainment industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one network and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv networks having lower viewership  such as our networks  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees or to allow carriage of the networks without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv networks  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our networks and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and operating results  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to distribute our content via new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 

table of contents moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry networks and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing networks  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position

current challenges the company faces numerous operating challenges 
among such challenges are increasing viewership ratings  maintaining and increasing advertising revenue  maintaining and expanding the distribution of the networks  broadening viewership demographics to meet our target audience  and controlling costs and expenses 
ratings ratings success plays a significant role in our ability to achieve our distribution and advertising goals 
we believe our ratings are affected by our ability to i acquire and produce series and original movies that appeal to our target demographic and ii develop a programming schedule that attracts a high number of viewers 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate hallmark channel s highest ratings 
in the past  the company has typically incurred additional marketing and promotional expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies to drive higher ratings 
certain acquired series delivered historically strong ratings  but recently they have been part of the decline experienced in viewer ratings 
we plan to continue or increase the number of our original productions and develop a programming schedule that attracts a greater number of viewers in our target demographic  all while controlling the costs and expenses relating to these actions 
advertising revenue the changes in the economy during fourth quarter of had a slightly negative impact on cable advertising rates 
in the fourth quarter of  our sales of inventory in the scatter market were at rates greater than the rates we realized for upfront sales and were generally at rates similar to those we realized in the scatter market  which was offset by the fact that our direct response rates were down by compared to that inventory sold in the same period of  with the addition of overnight and early morning inventory reducing the average 
in the upfront process relating to the sale of advertising for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  we entered into agreements with major advertising firms covering approximately of our advertising inventory 
in the upfront process relating to the sale of advertising for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  we entered into agreements with major advertising firms covering approximately of our advertising inventory 
the inventory was sold at cpms higher than the inventory sold in the upfront  including increases in rates related to our lifestyle programming block 
we sold additional general rate inventory for the broadcast season to advertisers that purchase upfront inventory on a calendar year basis  rather than an advertising year basis  and will sell the balance in the scatter marketplace 
additionally  we sold approximately of hallmark movie channel s available inventory in the upfront  as compared to in the upfront 
following the upfront period  sales of our general rate and direct response inventory are made closer to the timing of the actual advertisement 
advertisers with upfront contracts have an option to terminate their contracts  as well as an option to expand the amount of inventory purchased under the contracts 
no cancellation options were exercised during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents distribution agreements distribution agreements with multiple systems operators are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and the rates charged for advertising 
our long term distribution challenge will be obtaining favorable renewals of our major distribution agreements as they expire 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from june through december  inclusive of renewal options 
of these distribution agreements  agreements accounting for approximately of hallmark channel subscriber base and of hallmark movie channel subscriber base will expire or be the subject of renewal negotiations prior to december  the universe of cable and satellite tv subscribers in the united states is approximately million homes 
the top cable tv networks in the united states  measured by the number of subscribers  have million or more subscribers 
it is a mature market with relatively high penetration 
according to nielsen media research  hallmark channel had approximately million subscribers at december   and million subscribers at december   making it the th most widely distributed advertising supported cable network in the united states at each date 
as of december   hallmark movie channel was distributed to million subscribers 
demographics as pay television networks draw audience share  audience demographics ie  viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  gender and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products by advertising on networks which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we believe that the key demographics for hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to however  the average median age of a viewer of hallmark channel for the year was  and the total day average median age of viewers of hallmark channel and hallmark movie channel was and  respectively 
for the year  the average median viewing age was for hallmark channel and for hallmark movie channel 
in order to achieve our revenue goals  we need to draw in our target audience 
revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of advertising fees and subscriber fees 
for the years ended december   and revenue from the sale of advertising time on our networks was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the networks was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
information relating to advertising fees and subscriber fees is presented above in item business sources of revenue cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the amortization of program license fees  the cost of signal distribution and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
when necessary  we evaluate the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenue 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenue and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis blocks of time during the day as it pertains to programming licensed to a network 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenue are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
if the analysis were to indicate that the costs were in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs would immediately be recognized in the amount of the excess 
goodwill at december   we had a stockholders equity of million and a goodwill asset of million 
all of our goodwill relates to our network operations segment  which is also our only reporting unit 
in november we first assessed qualitatively whether it was necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we did not believe  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting period was less than its carrying amount  and  therefore  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test was not required 
in order to further support our qualitative assessment  we also performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
we note that if our fair value estimate was lower  we would still not have failed the initial test and no impairment charge would be taken 
revenue recognition advertising revenue  net of agency commissions  is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for the company s broadcasting operations 
customers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue or audience deficiency units 
subscriber revenue from pay television distributors is recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recorded net of amortization of subscriber acquisition costs 
audience deficiency unit liability audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for a program s failure to deliver its guaranteed audience 
an audience deficiency liability results when impressions delivered on guaranteed ratings are less than the impressions guaranteed to advertisers 
the liability is reduced when we air the advertisement during another program to make good on the under delivery of impressions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million and were invested in cash 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not used derivatives for speculative purposes 
if we use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates and equity investment prices  given a specified 
table of contents confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or of total assets  as of december  our material liability subject to interest rate risk consisted of our term loan 
the balance of this liability was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense for this liability is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor eurodollar interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities 
our variable rate term loan was subject to an interest rate floor from issuance on july  through december  accordingly  if the relevant market interest rate had been greater or lower  the effect on the term loan s effective interest rate and resulting interest expense for the period would have been negligible
