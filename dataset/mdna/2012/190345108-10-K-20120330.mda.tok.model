item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe that coast is one of the largest wholesale suppliers of replacement parts  supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles rvs and boats in north america 
we supply more than  products and serve more than  customers throughout the united states and canada  from regional distribution centers in the united states and regional distribution centers in canada 
our sales are made primarily to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers collectively  aftermarket customers 
factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products our sales are affected primarily by the usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom our aftermarket customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and their purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and purchases of new and used rvs and boats by consumer  because they often accessorize their rvs and boats at or shortly after the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers  their confidence about economic conditions and the availability and the costs to them of credit 
as a result  recessionary conditions and a tightening in the availability or increases in the costs of borrowings to consumers often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increases in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
finally  the usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore their need for and purchases of the products we sell are affected by weather conditions 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides information comparing our results of operations in the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operation in fiscal and fiscal dollars are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december  increase decrease vs 
increase decrease vs 
amount amount amount percent amount amount percent net sales costs of sales gross profits sg a expenses operating income loss interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted inclusive of distribution costs 

table of contents even though sales remained largely unchanged in  as compared to  as the above table indicates  in we incurred a loss from operations of  and a net loss of  or per diluted share  as compared to operating income of million and net earnings of  or per diluted share  in the loss from operations and the net loss incurred in were primarily attributable to a nearly million  or  decrease in gross profits in  as compared to that decrease was due primarily to i a change in the mix of products sold to a higher proportion of lower margin products  principally air conditioners  and ii price reductions on selected products in response to increased price competition in our markets in the face of continued weakness in consumer demand and rising gasoline prices that adversely affected the usage of rvs and boats particularly in the last four months of partially offsetting the effect of the decrease in gross profits on our results of operations in were a  reduction in interest and other expense and a  income tax benefit 
outlook for we are continuing to see fluctuations in consumer demand for rv and boating products due primarily to continued uncertainties about the strength and duration of the economic recovery and recent increases in the prices of gasoline 
as a result  we expect that conditions in the rv and boating markets will remain unstable and difficult until there is a more sustained economic recovery that leads to steady decreases in rates of unemployment and increases in the availability of credit to small businesses and consumers  and gasoline prices stabilize 
our strategic goals for are to achieve a return to profitability by i capturing additional market share and thereby increasing our sales  ii improving our gross margin  primarily by increasing our sales of higher margin proprietary products and iii continuing to monitor and  where practicable  implementing additional measures to reduce our sg a expenses 
however  we are not able to predict whether we will succeed in achieving our goals for  as this will depend in large measure on whether or not there is a meaningful improvement in economic conditions generally and in our markets in particular during critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including the assumptions and judgments we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance 
however  those assumptions and judgments are necessarily based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the prospects for realizing the values at which we had recorded these assets  pursuant to gaap we may be required to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves  an allowance for inventory obsolescence and a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to the extent necessary to reduce its carrying value to the amount of that asset that we believe we are likely to be able to use to reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
the amounts at which those allowances or reserves are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
we periodically increase or replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our allowances or reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic downturns  will be of short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  we make such estimates based upon the information available to us at that time and reevaluate and adjust the reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 

table of contents under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are included in revenue and our shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product for return 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we sometimes grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts receivable in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events or circumstances that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of customers to make payments to us on a timely basis  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory and reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
we are a wholesale distributor and not a manufacturer of products and  therefore  all of our inventory consists of finished goods 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines and estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and trends 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary for us to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which we operate  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were  or approximately of total inventories  at december   as compared to  or approximately of total inventories  at december  we were able to reduce our inventory reserve primarily as a result of sales and disposals of excess and obsolete inventory during 
table of contents deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce the amounts of our income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely  than not  that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us that it is more likely  than not  that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in their entirety prior to their expiration  then we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount that we believe we will be able to utilize 
that reduction would be implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that would be recorded in our statement of operations 
at december   the aggregate amount of our net deferred tax asset was approximately million  as compared to million at december  this increase was largely attributable to an increase in our nol carryforwards in long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our canadian and other foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of compensation paid in stock or other equity instruments as an expense in the calculation of net earnings loss 
the company recognizes stock based compensation expense in the period in which the employee is required to provide service  which is generally over the vesting period of the individual equity instruments 
stock options issued in lieu of cash to non employees for services performed are recorded at the fair value of the options at the time they are issued and are expensed as service is provided 
stock based compensation expense in the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
warranty costs 
we generally do not independently warrant the products that we distribute 
instead  in almost all cases  the manufacturers of the products that we distribute warrant the products and allow us to return defective products  including those that have been returned to us by our customers 
however  we sell a line of portable generators under a product supply arrangement which obligates us to provide warranty services for these products and to share the costs of providing those services with the manufacturer 
the duration of the warranty period for these products is months following the sale of the product to a retail customer 
we established warranty reserves for these products of  and  at december  and  respectively 
those amounts were determined on the basis of a number of factors  including our sales of the products that we warrant and our historical and expected future warranty claims experience 
in the event changes occur in the conditions or circumstances upon which those assumptions and estimates were made  it could become necessary for us to increase the reserve by means of a charge to our income 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements with the exception of those discussed below  there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended december   that we believe are of significance  or potential significance to the company based upon current operations 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  topic business combinations asu  to improve consistency in how the pro forma disclosures are calculated 
the amendment enhances the disclosure requirements and requires a description of the nature and amount of any material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination 
the amendment became effective for the company beginning on january  and is applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date 
the company will assess the impact of the amendment if and when future business combinations occur 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to disclosure requirements for common fair value measurement 
these amendments  effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   result in common definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
consequently  the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the implementation of this amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
although the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the company has adopted this new standard in fiscal year december  and our adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position at  or on our results of operations or cash flows in in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning january   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating this guidance  but do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated guidance on new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entity s rights of set off and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
under us gaap  certain derivative and repurchase agreement arrangements are granted exceptions from the general off setting model 
the new disclosure requirement will provide financial statements users information regarding both gross and net exposures 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim financial statements beginning on or after january  retrospective application is required 
we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this standard 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance indefinitely deferred certain provisions  including the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
we believe that our adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

dollars in the table are in thousands 
change vs 
change vs 
vs 
we believe that the decrease in net sales in as compared to was due to decreases in purchases and in the usage of rvs and boats  and  therefore in the purchases of the products we sell  primarily as a result of i continuing uncertainties about the strength of the economy and persistently high rates of unemployment  which adversely affected consumer confidence and the willingness of consumers to make discretionary expenditures involved in purchasing and using rvs and boats  and ii rising gasoline prices  particularly during the last four months of  which increased the costs and reduced the willingness of consumers to use their rvs and boats 
also contributing to the decline in the net sales during were unusually severe weather conditions in the northeastern us and canada in the first half of  which led to reductions in the usage of rvs and boats by consumers in those regions and  therefore  in their need for and purchase of the products we sell 
vs 
the increase in net sales in as compared to was due to a modest firming  in the first half of the year  in the demand for the products that we sell  as our customers replenished product inventories  and in the second half of the year  to an increase in sales of air conditioners that are installed on rvs 
that increase in our share of the rv air conditioner after market was primarily attributable to an unexpected withdrawal  from the rv market  of a manufacturer that had supplied air conditioners to some of the rv aftermarket distributors with which we compete  which led some of their after market customers to order air conditioners from us 
gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the costs of sales from net sales 
costs of sales consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  inbound freight charges  merchandise receiving  handling and storage costs  and out bound freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin 
table of contents vs 
the decrease in our gross profits and the resulting decrease in our gross margin in  as compared to  was primarily due to i a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of products  such as air conditioners  on which we realize lower margins than we do on sales of our other products  and ii selected price reductions that we implemented in response to increased price competition in our markets 
vs 
although gross profits increased modestly in  as compared to  our gross margin declined to in from in this decline was due to a combination of factors  consisting primarily of i a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of lower margin items  ii selected price reductions that we implemented in response to increased price competition in our markets  iii an increase in freight in costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  and administrative labor and other administrative expenses  professional fees  insurance and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred

the other component of other expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains or losses and gains or losses on disposal of assets 
vs 
interest expense decreased in by  or  in  as compared to  due primarily to a decrease in the average rate of interest charged on those borrowings which was due to declines in market rates of interest which determine the interest rates charged by the bank on those borrowings 

table of contents vs 
interest expense decreased in by  or  in  as compared to  due primarily to a reduction in our average outstanding credit line borrowings and a decrease in the average rate of interest charged on those borrowings 
that reduction in credit line borrowings was made possible by a modest reduction in average inventories primarily as a result of efficiencies realized in our distribution and warehouse operations and a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to our continued application of the more stringent credit standards adopted in in response to the economic recession 
the decrease in the average rate of interest charged on our credit line borrowings was due to declines in market rates of interest which determine the interest rates charged by the bank on those borrowings 
income tax provision benefit year ended december  income tax provision benefit effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected primarily by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  including stock based compensation expense  and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries  because tax rates in their respective countries vary  sometimes considerably  from income tax rates in the united states 
in addition  in years when our income or loss is marginal  state franchise and other taxes can lead to increases in our overall tax rate or decreases in our tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds 
see sources and uses of cash below 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with  day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  we sometimes provide our most creditworthy customers with payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and second quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
our revolving bank line of credit agreement permits us to borrow up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of the value of our eligible accounts receivable and up to of the value of our eligible inventory 
our borrowing base under our revolving credit line was  at december  as compared to  at december  interest is payable at the bank s prime rate at december  plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at the bank s libor rate at december  plus 
the maturity date of the revolving bank line of credit is july  as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial and other covenants under our bank line of credit agreement 
beginning march   we will be required to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to for rolling month periods ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter  and the bank has reduced the maximum amount of credit line borrowings that will be available to us by million until that covenant is achieved 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness that the company may incur 

table of contents sources and uses of cash we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
cash used in operations in and during  we used cash of million for our operations  primarily to fund our net loss of million and a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by million in depreciation and amortization expenses and million in stock based compensation expense 
by comparison  in  we used cash of million for our operations  which was comprised of a million increase in inventory and a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  million increase in accrued liabilities  net earnings of million  million in depreciation and amortization and in stock based compensation expense 
cash provided by financing activities in and during and  our financing activities provided us with million and million  respectively  of cash principally the result of net borrowings of long term debt under our revolving bank line of credit 
cash flows used in investing activities in and in  we used million of cash in investing activities principally to fund purchases of other assets and capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  office  and computer equipment 
in  we used cash of million in investing activities  primarily to fund the purchase of other assets and for capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  testing and design  and computer equipment 
contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately million 
the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments in thousands of dollars  as of december  year ending december  thereafter total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  maturities of contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations less than one year more than one and less than four years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations totals consists of borrowings under our bank credit facility  which matures in july 
table of contents our long term debt obligations consist primarily of borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit agreement 
it is not possible to calculate future estimated interest payments on those borrowing predictably  because the amounts of such borrowings fluctuate throughout the year depending on our liquidity needs  which can vary widely primarily due to the seasonality of our business and the effects of prevailing economic conditions on the demand for and the purchases of our products by customers 
also  the interest rate on those borrowings is determined by reference to the bank s prime rate or libor  which also can and often do fluctuate during the year 
additionally  the formulas for determining the specific interest rate that will apply to such borrowings can change from year to year 
set forth above  under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources working capital liquidity and cash flows are the formulas for determining the interest rates that will apply to those borrowings during the fiscal year ending december  dividend policy and dividend payments 
in  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders 
in november  our board of directors suspended the payment of cash dividends in order to preserve cash for operations in response to the worsening of the economic recession and the tightening of credit by banks and other lending institutions to businesses  as well as consumers 
in addition  our bank credit line agreement contains restrictions on our payment of cash dividends 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future 
expected uses and sources of funds we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range from  to  we expect that these expenditures will be of a recurring nature  for such purposes as the replacement and upgrading of warehouse  computer or office equipment in the ordinary course of our business 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures and our working capital requirements with borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds  assuming that there is not a further worsening of the economic recession in see item a of part i of this report above  entitled risk factors our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in part i of this report 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins by  among other things  establishing new product supply relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in asia  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 
there is no assurance  however  that  if required  we will be able to obtain bank borrowings for these purposes 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
we generate significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august  when usage of rvs and boats are at their peak  than we do during the remainder of the year when weather conditions are not optimal for outdoor activities 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we may incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when our sales are lower 

table of contents the following tables presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
march  june  september  december unaudited revenues gross profit net loss earnings net loss earnings per share diluted march  june  september  december unaudited revenues gross profit net loss earnings net loss earnings per share diluted inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit of million 
we have substantial sales operations in canada and as a result  our earnings  cash flows and financial position can be affected by movements in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
consequently  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
therefore  from time to time  we may hedge the net investment of our foreign operations in canada by purchasing foreign exchange derivatives  to mitigate the risk of changes in value of our net investment in our canadian subsidiary that can occur as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we held no foreign currency derivatives 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
