item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
also see forward looking statements discussion 
introduction and overview we are a national provider of comprehensive hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
we operate primarily in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
nature and economics of our business approximately of our revenues are earned on a project basis for installation of hvac systems in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of hvac systems in existing facilities 
customers hire us to ensure such systems deliver specified or generally expected heating  cooling  conditioning and circulation of air in a facility 
this entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units  or in the case of larger facilities  separate core components such as chillers  boilers  air handlers  and cooling towers 
we also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting 
our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications  which we frequently participate in establishing 
our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites  deploying labor to perform the work  and coordinating with other service providers on the project  including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work 
when competing for project business  we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project  and then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms 
our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer  the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate  the schedule on which we will be paid  the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project  and other costs that we incur more broadly to support our operations but which are not specific to the project 
typically customers will seek bids from competitors for a given project 
while the criteria on which customers select the winning bid vary widely and include factors such as quality  technical expertise  on time performance  post project support and service  and company history and financial strength  we believe that price is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing an hvac installation and service provider 
after a customer accepts our bid  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project  what our related responsibilities are  and how much and when we will be paid 
our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract  although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders 
project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project 
project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have 
table of contents completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
as of december   we had  projects in process 
our average project takes six to nine months to complete  with an average contract price of approximately  our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs 
customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms as discussed above generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
we have what we believe is a well diversified distribution of revenues across end use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector 
because of the integral nature of hvac and related controls systems to most buildings  we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems  except with respect to some government buildings 
the service work that we do  which is discussed further below  usually does not give rise to lien rights 
we also perform larger hvac projects 
as of december   we had projects in process with a contract price greater than million  projects between million and million  projects between million and million  and projects between million and million 
taken together  projects with contract prices of million or more totaled  million of aggregate contract value as of december   or approximately  out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of  million 
generally  projects closer in size to million will be completed in one year or less 
it is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length 
in addition to project work  approximately of our revenues represent maintenance and repair service on already installed hvac and controls systems 
this kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform 
prices to the customer are usually based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time 
we usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete  typically with payment terms of up to thirty days 
we also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts 
under these contracts  we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements 
these agreements typically cover periods ranging from one to three years with thirty to sixty day cancellation notice periods 
a relatively small portion of our revenues comes from national and regional account customers 
these customers typically have multiple sites  and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service 
these contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation 
we operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service 
we perform the majority of this work with our own employees  with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications 
we will also typically use proprietary information systems to maintain information on the customers sites and equipment  including performance and service records  and related cost data 
these systems track the status of ongoing service and installation work  and may also monitor system performance data 
under these contractual relationships  we usually provide consolidated billing and credit payment terms to the customer 

table of contents profile and management of our operations we manage our operating units based on a variety of factors 
financial measures we emphasize include profitability  and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost  billings and receivables 
we also monitor selling  general  administrative and indirect project support expense  backlog  workforce size and mix  growth in revenues and profits  variation of actual project cost from original estimate  and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts 
operational factors we emphasize include project selection  estimating  pricing  management and execution practices  labor utilization  safety  training  and the make up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued in terms of project size  technical application and facility type  end use customers and industries  and location of the work 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
economic and industry factors as an hvac and building controls services provider  we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector 
while we do not have operations in all major cities of the united states  we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector 
as a result  we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector  including trends in gross domestic product  interest rates  business investment  employment  demographics  and the general fiscal condition of federal  state and local governments 
spending decisions for building construction  renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis  usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed 
with larger amounts of capital  time  and discretion involved  spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty  particularly concerns about economic and financial conditions and trends 
we have experienced periods of time when economic weakness caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work 
operating environment and management emphasis nonresidential building construction and renovation activity  as reported by the federal government  declined over the three year period of to  expanded moderately during and  and was strong over the three year period from to we experienced significant industry activity declines over the three year period from to during the periods of decline  we responded to market challenges by pursuing work in sectors less affected by the downturn  such as government  educational  and health care facilities  and by establishing marketing initiatives that take advantage of our size and range of expertise 
we also responded to declining gross profits over those years by reducing our selling  general  and administrative expenses  and our indirect project and service overhead costs 
we believe our efforts in these areas partially offset the decline in our profitability over that period 
as a result of our continued strong emphasis on cash flow  our debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility is zero  and we have substantial uncommitted cash balances  as discussed further 
table of contents in liquidity and capital resources below 
we have a credit facility in place with considerably less restrictive terms than those of our previous facilities  this facility does not expire until september we have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs  and we believe our relationships with the surety markets are positive in light of our strong current results and financial position 
we have generated positive free cash flow in each of the last thirteen calendar years and will continue our emphasis in this area 
we believe that the relative size and strength of our balance sheet and surety support as compared to most companies in our industry represent competitive advantages for us 
as discussed at greater length in results of operations below  we have seen declining activity levels in our industry since late and we expect price competition to continue to be strong  as local and regional competitors respond cautiously to changing conditions 
we will continue our efforts to find the more active sectors in our markets  and to increase our regional and national account business 
our primary emphasis for will be on execution and cost control  and on maintaining activity levels that will permit us to earn reasonable profits while preserving our core workforce 
we have increased our focus on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
our most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage of completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities  valuation of deferred tax assets  accounting for acquisitions and the recoverability of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting approximately of our revenue was earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials exclusive of rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
these contract costs are included in our results of operations under the caption cost of services 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
labor costs are considered to be incurred as the work is performed 
subcontractor labor is recognized as the work is performed  but is generally subjected to approval as to milestones or other evidence of completion 
non labor project costs consist of purchased equipment  prefabricated materials and other materials 
purchased equipment on our projects is substantially produced to job specifications and is a value added element to our work 
the costs are considered to be incurred when title is transferred to us  which typically is upon delivery to the worksite 
prefabricated materials  such as ductwork and piping  are generally performed at our shops and recognized as contract costs when fabricated for the unique specifications of the job 
other materials costs are not significant and are generally recorded when delivered to the worksite 
this 
table of contents measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract  and these updates may include subjective assessments 
we generally do not incur significant costs prior to receiving a contract  and therefore  these costs are expensed as incurred 
in limited circumstances  when significant pre contract costs are incurred  they are deferred if the costs can be directly associated with a specific contract and if their recoverability from the contract is probable 
upon receiving the contract  these costs are included in contract costs 
deferred costs associated with unsuccessful contract bids are written off in the period that we are informed that we will not be awarded the contract 
project contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs 
the schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which costs are incurred 
as a result  contract revenue recognized in the statement of operations can and usually does differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
amounts by which cumulative contract revenue recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenue recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance  job conditions  and final contract settlements 
these factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenue 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments 
the effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 
when such revisions lead to a conclusion that a loss will be recognized on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period such conclusion is reached  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price 
revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer 
except in certain circumstances  we do not recognize revenue or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer 
the amount of revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims is currently immaterial 
variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results  depending on project size  and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectability of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivable amounts we believe we will not ultimately collect 
this requires us to make certain judgments and estimates involving  among others  the creditworthiness of our customers  prior collection history with our customers  ongoing relationships with our customers  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to the contract 
these estimates are evaluated and adjusted as needed when additional information is received 

table of contents accounting for self insurance liabilities we are substantially self insured for workers compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
loss estimates associated with the larger and longer developing risks workers compensation  auto liability and general liability are reviewed by a third party actuary quarterly 
we believe these accruals are adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that such experience becomes known 
accounting for deferred tax assets we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation quarterly 
estimations of required valuation allowances include estimates of future taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets becomes deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income is less than the estimates  we may not realize all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets 
acquisitions we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  including contingent assets and liabilities  based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition 
contingent consideration in certain acquisitions  we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain predetermined profitability targets 
beginning in  we have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition date fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized in income from operations 
for acquisitions prior to  these obligations are recognized as incurred and accounted for as an adjustment to the initial purchase price of the acquired assets 
contingent assets and liabilities assets and liabilities arising from contingencies are recognized at their acquisition date fair value when their respective fair values can be determined 
if the fair values of such contingencies cannot be determined  they are recognized at the acquisition date if the contingencies are probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
acquisition date fair value estimates are revised as necessary if  and when  additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
recoverability of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
we assess goodwill for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
when the carrying value of a given reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its 
table of contents carrying value 
if other reporting units have had increases in fair value  such increases may not be recorded 
accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other reporting units 
the requirements for assessing whether goodwill has been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessment 
we currently perform our annual impairment testing as of october and any impairment charges resulting from this process are reported in the fourth quarter 
we segregate our operations into reporting units based on the degree of operating and financial independence of each unit and our related management of them 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying value 
if  after completing such assessment  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then there is no need to perform any further testing 
if we conclude otherwise  then we perform the first step of a two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on two market approaches and an income approach  which utilizes discounted future cash flows 
assumptions critical to the fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow model include discount rates  cash flow projections  projected long term growth rates and the determination of terminal values 
the market approaches utilized market multiples of invested capital from comparable publicly traded companies public company approach and comparable transactions transaction approach 
the market multiples from invested capital include revenues  book equity plus debt and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
there are significant inherent uncertainties and management judgment involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible that a material change could occur 
if actual results are not consistent with our current estimates and assumptions  or the current economic downturn worsens or the projected recovery is significantly delayed beyond our projections  goodwill impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives 
changes in strategy and or market condition  may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances or their useful lives

the same store revenue increase stemmed primarily from increased activity in the nonresidential markets throughout the united states especially in the government sector approximately million 
we have seen increased activity  mainly in our maryland operation 

table of contents backlog reflects revenue still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work 
project work generally lasts less than one year 
service agreement revenue and service work and short duration projects which are generally billed as performed do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenue for any given future period  and it represents revenue that is likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog as of december  was million  a decrease from september  backlog of million and a increase from december  backlog of million 
sequential backlog decreased on a same store basis primarily related to our maryland and wisconsin operations  but was offset by a increase related to the acquisition of eas

we also recorded an intangible asset impairment of million during as a result of a decision in the fourth quarter of to curtail future operations at our operating location in delaware 
this 
table of contents impairment charge resulted from our estimation that the carrying value of such intangibles will not be fully recoverable 
the company expects that in a future reporting period the delaware operation will meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation 
the goodwill for this location was fully impaired in interest income interest income decreased million  or  in the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances in interest expense interest expense increased million  or  in the increase is due to the increase in notes to former owners and amortization on debt financing costs incurred on the senior credit facility we entered into during the year 
changes in the fair value of contingent earn out obligations changes in the fair value of contingent earn out obligations increased million in to million

other income other income increased million in compared to the increase is primarily related to a settlement of a legal matter that resulted in a million gain 
income tax expense our year to date effective tax rate for was  as compared to in the effective tax rate in the current year was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impact of a permanent difference related to the portion of the goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for tax purposes and an increase in valuation allowances related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
this was partially offset by permanent differences generated by acquisition related fair value adjustments 
adjustments to tax reserves are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such changes 
adjustments to tax reserves are a component of the effective tax rate

table of contents outlook we expect that weakness in the underlying environment for nonresidential activity has and will continue to affect activity levels in our industry compared to recent years 
our backlog  while still at solid levels by historical standards  has declined substantially in recent years 
our primary emphasis for will be on execution including a focus on cost discipline and efficient project and service performance 
based on our backlog and the weak economic conditions for our industry  we expect continued profitability during but we expect that the lower levels of profitability  similar to those that we experienced in  will continue in liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents free cash flow cash provided by operating activities taxes paid related to pre acquisition equity transactions of an acquired company purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow cash flow our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long term fixed assets 
the substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customer pays us 
customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year

additionally  we paid million of debt related to acquisitions 
free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities  less customary capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from asset sales and taxes paid related to pre acquisition equity transactions of an acquired company 
we believe free cash flow  by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle  is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency 
we have included free cash flow information here for this reason  and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating us 
however  free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results  and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income  net income  or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 
free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies 
marketable securities as of december   our marketable securities consisted of million of auction rate securities  which are variable rate debt instruments  having long term maturities with final maturities up to june 
we sold the entire million of these auction rate securities at face value during the first quarter of share repurchase program on march   our board of directors the board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to million shares of our outstanding stock

we repurchased million shares for approximately million and million shares for approximately million under our share repurchase program for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since the inception of the repurchase program in and as of december   we have repurchased a cumulative total of million shares for million  at an average price of per share 
debt credit facility on september   we amended our million senior credit facility the facility provided by a syndicate of banks 
the facility  which is available for borrowings and letters of credit  now expires in september and is secured by the capital stock of our current and future subsidiaries 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings  million in letters of credit outstanding and million of credit available 
there are two interest rate options for borrowings under the facility  the base rate loan option and the eurodollar rate loan option 
these rates are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets  meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time 
additional margins are then added to these two rates 
we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the facility would be approximately as of december  we have used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
our lenders issue such letters of credit through the facility for a fee 
we have never had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us and believe such claims are unlikely in the foreseeable future 
the letter of credit fees range from to per annum  based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to credit facility adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement 
commitment fees are payable on the portion of the revolving loan capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time 
these fees range from per annum  based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to credit facility adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement 
interest expense included the following primary elements in thousands year ended december  interest expense on notes to former owners interest expense on borrowings and unused commitment fees letter of credit fees amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs total the facility contains financial covenants defining various measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply 
covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end 
credit facility adjusted ebitda is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as net earnings for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  plus the corresponding amounts for a interest expense  b income taxes  c depreciation and amortization

fixed charge coverage ratio the facility requires that the ratio of credit facility adjusted ebitda  less non financed capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and amounts used to repurchase stock to the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments of indebtedness be at least  provided that the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio excludes stock repurchases and the payment of dividends at any time that the company s net leverage ratio does not exceed through december   through june  and through maturity 
capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and stock repurchase payments are defined under the facility for purposes of this covenant to be amounts for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date

other restrictions the facility permits acquisitions of up to million per transaction  provided that the aggregate purchase price of such an acquisition and of acquisitions in the preceding month period does not exceed million 
however  these limitations only apply when the company s net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than while the facility s financial covenants do not specifically govern capacity under the facility  if our debt level under the facility at a quarter end covenant compliance measurement date were to cause us to violate the facility s leverage ratio covenant  our borrowing capacity under the facility and the favorable terms that we currently enjoy could be negatively impacted by the lenders 
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of december  notes to former owners we issued subordinated notes to the former owners of acquired companies  as part of the consideration used to acquire these companies 
these notes had an outstanding balance of million  of which million is current  as of december  and bear interest  payable annually  at a weighted average interest rate of other debt in conjunction with our acquisition of colonialwebb  we acquired million of long term debt related to an industrial revenue bond associated with its office building and warehouse 
currently  million of this debt is outstanding 
we have included both the million current portion and the 
table of contents million long term portion on our balance sheet as of december  the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt as of december  was approximately 
outlook we have generated positive net free cash flow for the last thirteen calendar years  much of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions 
we also expect to have borrowing capacity under our credit facility and we maintain what we feel are reasonable cash balances 
we believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
we have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
the letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through the facility as described above 
a letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the lenders 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
absent a claim  there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit 
however  because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders  letters of credit are treated as a use of the facility s capacity just the same as actual borrowings 
claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
if we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur 
to date  we are not aware of any losses to our sureties in connection with bonds the sureties have posted on our behalf  and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently challenging as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately to 
table of contents of our business has required bonds 
while we have strong surety relationships to support our bonding needs  current market conditions as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
we would likely also encounter concerns from customers  suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness 
while we believe our general operating and financial characteristics  including a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet  would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  such an interruption would likely cause our revenues and profits to decline in the near term 
contractual obligations the following recaps the future maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total notes to former owners other debt interest payable operating lease obligations total as discussed in note income taxes  included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits may be concluded  we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
absent any significant commitments of capital for items such as capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases  it is reasonable to expect us to continue to maintain excess cash on our balance sheet 
therefore  we assumed that we would continue our current status of not using any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we also have million in letter of credit commitments  of which million will expire in and million will expire in the substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our workers compensation  auto liability and general liability insurance program 
these letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf  many of which develop over long periods of time  should we ever encounter financial duress 
posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self insurance programs through third party insurers as we do 
while most of these letter of credit commitments expire in  we expect nearly all of them  particularly those supporting our insurance programs  will be renewed annually 
other than the operating lease obligations noted above  we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
we are actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we have limited exposure to changes in interest rates under our revolving credit facility  the notes to former owners and the industrial revenue bond 
we have a debt facility under which we may borrow funds in the future 
we do not currently foresee any borrowing needs 
our debt with fixed interest rates consists of notes to former owners of acquired companies 
the following table presents principal amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  twelve months ended december  thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december  was approximately 
we measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
for the year ended december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and an intangible impairment charge of million 
we did not recognize any other impairments on those assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
the valuation of the company s contingent earn out payments is determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the purchase agreements eg  minimum and maximum payment  length of earn out periods  manner of calculating any amounts due  etc 
and utilizes assumptions with regard to future cash flows  probabilities of achieving such future cash flows and a discount rate
