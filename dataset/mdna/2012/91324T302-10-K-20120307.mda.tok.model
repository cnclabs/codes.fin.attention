we currently operate in two reportable segments fulfillment and engineering and construction 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible assets  reserves and accruals  impairment of assets  income taxes  insurance reserves and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions change or if certain key assumptions used in making these estimates ultimately prove to be materially incorrect 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and they require significant or complex judgment and estimates on the part of management 
refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies  for further description of the company s significant accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed frequently with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition fulfillment segment fulfillment services are generally performed under master or other services agreements and are billed on a contractually agreed price per unit  work order basis 
revenue and related costs for master and other service agreements billed on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are rendered 
under master service and similar type service agreements  we furnish specified units of service for a separate fixed price per unit of service 
we recognize revenue from fulfillment services net of equipment cost payable to the customer because we are acting as an agent 
engineering and construction segment the company enters into contracts that require the installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under these contracts  revenue is recognized at the contractually agreed price per unit as the units are completed 
unbilled revenues represent amounts earned and recognized in the period for which customer billings are issued in a subsequent period per the contract terms 
losses are recognized when such losses become known 
in the wireless portion of the engineering and construction segment  revenue for site acquisition and zoning services is based upon output measures using contract milestones as the basis 
revenue from infrastructure equipment construction and installation contracts  which are generally completed within days  is recorded under the percentage of completion method based on the percentage that total direct costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion 
losses are recognized when such losses become known 
all other revenue is recognized as the work is performed 
under this method of accounting  contracts in progress are valued at cost plus accrued profits less paid revenue and progress payments made on uncompleted projects 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised monthly by management as the work progresses  such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of revision 
adjustments are reflected for the fiscal period affected by such revisions 
as a result of the acquisition of pinnacle  certain customer contracts within our engineering and construction segment include multiple deliverables  typically involving the design  construction and implementation of public safety radio networks with a separate maintenance component for a specific period of time following implementation 
the maintenance component of these contracts is typically for a period of one to ten years 
we account for the maintenance component of these contracts as a separate unit of accounting with the revenue being recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance period 
the revenue for the remaining portion of the contract is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the value assigned to each unit of accounting is objectively determined and obtained primarily from sources such as the separate selling price for that item or a similar item or from competitor prices for similar items 
unbilled revenue represents revenue on uncompleted infrastructure equipment construction and installation contracts that are not yet billed or billable and revenue recognized on completed projects that are not yet billed  pursuant to contract terms 
deferred revenues principally represent the value of services to customers that have been billed as of the balance sheet date  but for which the requisite services have not yet been rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectability of accounts receivable based on the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  customer financial condition and credit reports  availability of mechanics and other liens  specific customer issues  existence of payment bonds and other sources of payment and current economic trends 
if our estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable change  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required  which could reduce our profitability 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level 
the assets of each acquired business and the related goodwill are assigned to the applicable reporting unit at the date of acquisition 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether businesses holding purchased assets  including goodwill  and related assumed liabilities have discrete financial information available 
our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the value of the reporting units goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
we performed our required annual goodwill impairment test as of october  while there were no impairments identified  one reporting unit had a decline in the excess of fair value as compared to carrying value due to the short term impact of lower revenue 
the current estimated fair value of the reporting unit is supported by projected growth in revenue from existing customers supported by overall predicted market spending 
should this growth in revenue not materialize as expected  the fair value could decline further and this reporting unit will be at a greater risk for a future impairment of goodwill 
the reporting unit s fair value exceeded the corresponding carrying value by less than 
the reporting unit s goodwill at december  is approximately million 
insurance reserves we presently maintain a high deductible liability insurance program  subject to per claim deductibles of million for our workers compensation policy with a million corridor policy effective july   million for our general liability policy and million for our automobile liability policy 
we have excess umbrella coverage up to million per claim and in the aggregate 
because most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under its insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
the company also has a self insured plan for medical and dental claims 
we determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect the undiscounted value of those liabilities in our balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
as of december  and  the liability for insurance reserves was million and million  respectively 
known amounts for claims that are in the process of being settled  but have been paid in periods subsequent to those being reported  are recorded in the subsequent reporting period 
our accruals are based upon known facts  historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses and we believe such accruals to be adequate 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using applicable tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be recovered 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets  such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
we consider future pretax income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the net realizable value of tax assets and the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is charged against income in the period such determination is made 
we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in based on our history of operating losses and our forecasts for future periods  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of contingent consideration we recognize the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree or assets of the acquiree in a business combination 
the contingent consideration is classified as either a liability or equity in accordance with asc accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
if classified as a liability  the liability is remeasured to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the contingency is resolved 
increases in fair value are recorded as losses on the statement of operations  while decreases are recorded as gains 
if classified as equity  contingent consideration is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity 
litigation and contingencies litigation and contingencies are reflected in our consolidated financial statements based on management s assessment of the expected outcome of such litigation or expected resolution of such contingency 
an accrual is made when the loss of such contingency is probable and reasonably estimable 
if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs significantly from our current expectations  such outcome could result in a charge to earnings
