item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and data derived therefrom 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a 
risk factors above 
overview we are a leading producer and distributor of milk powder  soybean milk powder  and related dairy products in the prc 
using proprietary processing techniques  we make products that are specially formulated for particular ages  dietary needs and health concerns 
we have over company owned milk collection stations  six production and distribution facilities with an aggregate raw milk processing capacity of approximately  tons per day  and an extensive distribution network that reaches over  retail outlets throughout china 
factors affecting our results of operations our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors dairy industry growth 
we believe the market for dairy products in china for the long term will be growing rapidly  driven by china s economic growth  increased penetration of infant formula  and a growing female working population 
despite the damage to the industry as a result of the melamine crisis in  we expect these factors to continue to drive industry growth 
we believe that economic growth in our primary markets has become an increasingly important driver of growth 
production capacity 
we believe much of the dairy market in china is still underserved  particularly with respect to infant formula 
in addition  since the melamine crisis in  which did not involve any of our products  we have at times operated our milk production facilities at maximum capacity 
accordingly  we believe that the ability to increase production of high quality dairy products will allow well positioned companies to significantly increase revenues and market share 
perceptions of product quality and safety 
we believe that rising consumer wealth in china has contributed to a greater demand for higher priced products with perceived quality advantages 
we believe many consumers in china tend to regard higher prices as indicative of higher quality and higher nutritional value  particularly in the areas of infant formula and nutritional products 
accordingly  we believe our reputation for quality and safety allows us to command higher average selling prices and generate higher gross margins than competitors who do not possess the same reputation 
conversely  any decrease in consumer perceptions of quality and safety could adversely impact us 
seasonality 
the dairy industry remains seasonal  with higher production in the summer season and greater demand in winter months 
this seasonality is offset by production of powder products with longer shelf lives 
raw material supply and prices 
the per unit costs of producing our infant formula are subject to the supply and price volatility of raw milk and other raw materials  which are affected by the prc and global markets 
for example  our raw milk prices decreased by approximately in  increased by approximately in and increased by approximately in we expect raw milk prices will continue to be affected by factors such as geographic location  rising feed prices  general economic conditions such as inflation and fuel prices  and fluctuations in production  rising production costs and competition  as well as increased competition abroad and currency fluctuations 
in  we sold the dairy farms  although we have milk supply arrangements with them described under business discontinued operations 
expenses associated with expansion and competition 
in implementing our plan to expand our business  we face corresponding increases in expenses  especially for sales and marketing expenses  in order to attract and retain qualified talent  monitor our sales by region and address potential cross territory selling activities by distributors  implement strategic advertising campaigns  and finance our expansion

sales increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of sales of milk powder and raw milk powder  offset by a decrease in sales of other products  which reflected our focus on sales of milk powder 
during  we focused on marketing our premium infant formula products and improving sales at existing sales points and  accordingly  our expansion into new market areas was less rapid

average price per kilogram percentage product change milk powder raw milk powder soybean powder rice cereal walnut products other total the average selling price per kilogram of milk powder increased by  from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our premium products  particularly our astro baby series and feifan series  which reflects our ongoing efforts to upgrade our product line 
the average selling price per kilogram for raw milk powder increased by  from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased demand and market prices of raw milk and raw milk powder 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consist primarily of direct and indirect manufacturing costs  including production overhead costs  and shipping and handling costs for the products we sell 
cost of goods sold increased approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to general increases in raw milk costs  costs of added nutrients and increase of labor costs 
operating expenses our total operating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  and goodwill and other intangible assets impairment 
our total operating expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and market promotion expenses  and other overhead expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million  or  in advertising expense and a decrease of approximately million  or  in salary of marketing staff  which was offset by an increase of approximately million  or  in salary of promoters 
also  our total promotion costs  which include expenses related to promotion activities and wages of certain sales personnel  decreased approximately million  or  in compared to during  we readjusted our advertisement plan and focused on our key regions  while decreasing other sales and marketing expenses in order to improved the effectiveness of our sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  travel expenses  entertainment expenses  benefits  share based compensation  and professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of million  an increase in corporate promotion expenses of million and an increase in miscellaneous tax expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as we continue to expand our production  sourcing capacity  and distribution capacity throughout china 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense 
we recognized a goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million or  from approximately million in other operating income loss  net other operating income loss  net increased by approximately million from a loss of approximately million in to an income of approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to fines we imposed on our distributors for impermissible cross territory sales activities 
operating income loss as a result of the foregoing  our income from continuing operations increased by approximately million from a loss of approximately million in to an income of approximately million in other income expenses our other income expenses consists primarily of interest and finance costs  loss on derivatives and government subsidies 
other income decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million  or  in government subsidies  which was mainly due to non recurring government subsidies granted during income tax benefits expenses we are subject to us federal and state income taxes  and our subsidiaries incorporated in the prc are subject to enterprise income taxes in the prc 
our income tax expenses were approximately million in  compared to an income tax benefit of approximately million in the increase in income tax expenses was primarily attributable to certain of our prc entities remaining profitable during net income from discontinued operations  net of tax in october we sold the dairy farms  and the operations relating to the dairy farms have been reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
our net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in comparison of years ended december  and sales sales decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to decrease of sales of milk powder  offset in part by an increase in sales of raw milk powder  which reflected the fact that there were new competitors entering into our industry and old competitors aggressively attempting to reclaim market share following the melamine crisis 
during  we focused on improving sales of existing sales points and  accordingly  our expansion into new market areas was less rapid 
while our full year sales decreased  our sales in the quarterly period ended december  increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  to approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  we believe this increase reflects our improved control of cross territory selling activities by distributors  as well as our sales of excess inventory as lower margin raw milk powder in an effort to manage inventory levels which occurred during the fourth quarter of our inventories increased approximately million  or  from approximately million as of december  to approximately million as of december   reflecting our increased production during our first and second fiscal quarters of to meet expected sales demand

total promotion costs include expenses related to promotion activities and wages of certain sales people 
during the year  we improved the effectiveness of sales and marketing expenses and our sales at existing sales points  rather than focusing on the expansion of our distribution network 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million  or  in staff salary and welfare contributions and an increase of approximately million  or in travelling and office administrative expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million  or  in professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as we continue to expand our production  sourcing capacity  and distribution capacity throughout china 
goodwill impairment expense 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  an increase of approximately million or  from approximately million in  related to shanxi feihe as a result of the stagnating growth of our walnut powder products 
as a result  goodwill related to shanxi feihe has been reduced to nil 
operating income loss as a result of the foregoing  our income from continuing operations decreased by approximately million from income of approximately million in to a loss of approximately million in other income expenses other income increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for the increase was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million  or  in interest and finance costs  an increase of approximately million  or  in government subsidies  a decrease of approximately million  or  in loss on derivatives  and offset by an increase of approximately million  or  in amortization of deferred charges 
loss on derivatives in was primarily attributable to change of the fair value of the derivatives relating to our redeemable common stock financing 
income tax benefits expenses our income tax benefits were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in income tax benefit was primarily due to the fact that certain prc entities of ours which were tax exempt in became subject to income taxes at a rate of in net loss from discontinued operations our net loss from discontinued operations increased from an income of approximately million in to a loss of approximately million in this loss primarily reflects our losses on the sale of under producing cows at the dairy farms we previously owned  which resulted in increased losses on disposal of biological assets of approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in also  net income from discontinued operations in reflects our income from discontinued operations of million associated with our former subsidiary heilongjiang moveup co  limited  which was disposed of in liquidity and capital resources overview in general  our primary uses of cash are for working capital purposes  which principally represent the purchase of inventory  servicing debt and other obligations and financing construction related to our expansion plans 
capital expenditures for continuing operations for the years ended december   and amounted approximately to million  million and million  respectively 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flows from operations  bank loans  proceeds from the sale of securities and borrowings under our line of credit 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
we had a working capital deficiency of approximately million as of december   compared to a working capital deficiency of million as of december  we have significant cash commitments in  including maturity of short term bank loans of million  current portion of long term bank loans of million and redemption of redeemable common stock of million 
however  we believe that we will be able to refinance our short term loans when they become due and we intend to do so 
in addition  we have also taken steps to reduce our operating expenses 
in the year ended december   we successfully refinanced our short term bank loans upon maturity 
accordingly  we believe that our existing cash  our cash generated from operations including cash savings from operating expenses resulting from our sale of the dairy farms  and our ability to draw down on unutilized credit lines will be sufficient to fund our expected cash flow requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the cash payments for the redemption common stock and planned capital expenditures 
cash flows as of december   we had retained earnings of approximately million  cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  total current assets of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
our summary cash flow information is as follows year ended december net cash provided by used in in thousands operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   net loss decreased by approximately million  while net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to the following changes decrease in cash flows from changes in accounts receivable of approximately million  reflecting increased receivables for sales of raw milk powder  primarily for sales in the fourth quarter  increase in cash flows from inventories of approximately million  reflecting our shift in product mix to high margin milk powder  and related sale of excess inventory at lower margins to stabilize our inventory level  increase in cash flows from accounts payable of approximately million  increase in cash flows from other payables of approximately million  increase in cash provided by discontinued operations of approximately million  increase in cash flows from due to related parties of million  and increase in cash flows from recoverable value added taxes of million 
for the year ended december  net income decreased by approximately million  while net cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in primarily due to the following changes in working capital items increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of approximately million  decrease in cash flows from inventories of approximately million reflecting our increased production in preparation to meet expected sales demand  decrease in cash flows of approximately million in notes payable primarily as a result of increased inventory purchases  increase in cash flows of approximately million in advances from customers for raw milk powder primarily attributable to increased sales of raw milk powder despite an overall decrease in sales  and decrease in cash provided by operating activities of million 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to our bank loans and expenditures associated with our construction and acquisition of new facilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million  from a net cash outflow of approximately million in to a net cash outflow of approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in proceeds from disposal of the dairy farms  offset by increase in investing cash outflows from our discontinued operations of million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased investing cash outflows from our discontinued operations of million and purchase of our longjiang feihe dairy operations for approximately million in  offset by proceeds of million from disposal of a subsidiary in  an increase in purchase of property and equipment of approximately million in  and increase in cash outflows from our restricted cash of million 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million  from a cash inflow of approximately million in to a cash outflow of approximately million in the increase in cash outflows was primarily attributable to an increase in net cash outflows of short term bank loans of approximately million  an increase net cash outflows of long term bank loans of approximately million  repayment for redeemable common stock of approximately million  payment of long term deposits of million in  and increase in financing cash outflows from our discontinued operations of million  which is partly offset by increases in proceeds from other long term loans of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in net cash outflows from long term bank loans of approximately million  a decrease in net cash inflows from short term bank loans of approximately million  decrease in financing cash outflows from our discontinued operations of approximately million  proceeds from issuance of redeemable common stock and warrant exercise of of million and million  respectively  in the decrease was offset by a repayment of short term debt of million in outstanding indebtedness redemption obligation in august  pursuant to a subscription agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to the purchasers  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
because we did not meet certain earnings per share targets for  we issued  additional shares to the purchasers pursuant to the subscription agreement 
in february  we entered into a redemption agreement with the purchasers to redeem and purchase from the purchasers the  shares issued pursuant to the subscription agreement in four equal installments within days of march   september   december  and march   for an aggregate payment on each such date of  together with interest accruing at the rate of per annum  compounded annually from august  until such date 
as of december   we had redeemed  shares for an aggregate consideration of million  and as of march  we had redeemed  shares for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
redemption of the remaining  shares must be completed within days of march  short and long term loans payable as of december   we had short term loans of approximately million and long term loans of approximately million from banks in the prc of which approximated million were subject to financial covenants

the maturity dates of the long term bank loans outstanding as of december  ranged from december  to december  the weighted average interest rate on short term bank loans and long term bank loans outstanding as of december  was and  respectively 
the loans were secured by pledges of certain fixed assets and land use rights held by our subsidiaries  guarantees of certain of our subsidiaries and personal guarantees of one of our directors 
our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness depends in part on the value of our assets  which depends  in turn  on the strength of our cash flows  results of operations  economic and market conditions and other factors 
line of credit we have a one year  unsecured line of credit with a bank of approximately million rmb million scheduled to expire in the forth fiscal quarter of the line of credit entitles us to draw demand loans for general corporate purposes

the loan accrued interest at the six month libor rate plus  with principal payable in equal semi annual installments and interest payable semi annually 
as of december   there was approximately million in principal payable under the loan  and the loan was fully repaid in june in november  we entered into a six year capital lease agreement for certain equipment under construction 
the terms of the lease required an initial payment of approximately  and a payment of rmb million approximately  on january th of each year after successful completion of production quality tests 
the equipment has been successfully installed and put into production in december   and was depreciated over an estimated productive life of years 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of equipment subject to the capital lease 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist mainly of payments related to long term debt and related interest  capital leases to purchase certain equipment  fin obligations  capital purchase of property  plant and equipment  and product purchase obligations

we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
we expect that our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of us and our subsidiaries 
all transactions and balances among us and our subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts and utilizing other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
estimates of allowances for bad debts we periodically review our receivables to determine if all are collectible or whether an allowance is required for possible uncollectible balances 
we perform this review quarterly  and in determining the allowances  a number of factors are considered  including the length of time the receivable is past due  past loss history  the counter party s current ability to pay and the general condition of the economy and industry 
as a result of this review and collection of older receivables  we have increased our estimated allowance for bad debts by  for the year ended december  and reduced it by  for the year ended december  and although our write offs of bad debts have been minimal in recent years and we had no write off in the year ended december   events and circumstances could occur that would require that we increase our allowance in the future 
estimate of the useful lives of property and equipment we estimate the useful lives and residual values of our property and equipment 
we also review property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recovered from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
we recognized no impairments in the years ended december  and inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
we determine the cost of inventories using the weighted average cost method and include any related production overhead costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition 
we determine whether we have any excessive  slow moving  obsolete or impaired inventory 
we perform this review quarterly  which requires management to estimate the future demand of our products and market conditions 
we make provisions on the value of inventories at period end equal to the difference between the cost and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions change  additional provisions may be required 
goodwill we test goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we currently have eight reporting units and only two reporting units carry assigned goodwill shanxi feihe and gannan feihe 
we perform annual impairment test on december on the two reporting units 
we recognize a goodwill impairment loss in our statements of operations when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which is based on their undiscounted cash flows 
these analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  expenses  and discount rates  which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict 
impairment of long lived assets we review and evaluate our long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the related carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the property is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
we perform the impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter each year 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership  which generally coincides with the time when the goods are shipped to customers and the title has passed 
revenue is shown net of sales returns  which amounted to less than of total sales in each of the years ended december   and  and net of sales discounts  which are determined based on our distributors sales volumes 
share based compensation share based compensation to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument as at the date of grant using the black scholes model  which requires assumptions for dividend yield  expected volatility and expected life of stock options 
the expected life of stock options is estimated by observing general option holder behavior 
the assumption of the expected volatility has been set by reference to the implied volatility of our shares in the open market and historical patterns of volatility 
performance and service vesting conditions attached to the options are included in assumptions about the number of shares that the option holder will ultimately receive 
on a regular basis we review the assumptions made and revise the estimates of the number of options expected to be settled  where necessary 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
we recognize the compensation costs net of a forfeiture rate and recognize the compensation costs for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
the estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the fair value of awards is amortized over the requisite service period  except for  options granted in may and  options granted in july that vest upon performance conditions 
for such performance based awards  we assess the probability of meeting such conditions in order to determine the compensation cost to be recognized 
redeemable common stock the value of redeemable common stock is measured at the fair value on the date of issuance 
when and if the redemption right expires  the common stock will be classified as permanent shareholders equity 
however  should the terms of the redemption change making it mandatory for us to redeem the common stock  such common stock will be reclassified to liabilities at its fair value with any differences between fair value and carrying value recognized in equity 
we assess the probability of redemption and accrue proper accretion on a quarterly basis 
until management determines it is probable that the common stock will become redeemable  the change in the redemption value is not accreted 
at issuance  we determined that the contractual arrangement pursuant to which we issued the redeemable common stock contained an embedded derivative whereby additional shares would be granted should we fail to meet certain performance targets  which was bifurcated from the host and recorded at fair value 
as of december   such performance targets were not attained and we recorded a loss of approximately million for the difference in the fair value of the additional shares as a result of the performance adjustment and the initial fair value of the embedded derivative 
on february   we entered into a redemption agreement committing us to redeem the common stock at a total price of million plus annual compounded interest  beginning from august  we agreed to consummate the redemption in four closings from march  through march  as of december    redeemable shares were outstanding for a total principal amount of million plus annual compounded interest

we adopted asc  income taxes previously financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin effective april  in accordance with asc  we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this guidance is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and international accounting standards board  or the iasb  to develop a single  converged fair value framework  including converged guidance on how not when to measure fair value and on what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements 
thus  there are few differences between this guidance and its international counterpart in ifrs 
while this guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
many of these amendments were made to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between us gaap and ifrss 
however  some could change how the fair value measurement guidance in us gaap is applied 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  for public entities 
the adoption of its guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides an entity the option of presenting total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the guidance eliminates the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we have not yet adopted this guidance and do not expect that its adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance is intended to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been made available for issuance 
we have not adopted this guidance and do not expect that its adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply the guidance for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by the guidance retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding comprehensive income 
the guidance allows the fasb time to re deliberate as to whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while the fasb is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect 
this guidance does not affect prior guidance on this topic  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents are placed primarily in demand deposits  with maturities of three months or less and short term investments are mutual funds 
except for borrowing of  which bear interest at a floating interest rates at rmb benchmark deposit interest rate  our borrowings bear fixed interest rates 
as of december   we had short term loans of approximately million and long term loans of approximately million from prc banks  and the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding short term bank loans and long term loans was and  respectively 
in addition  if we were to draw on our line of credit  interest would be a base rate established by the people s bank of china on the unpaid principal amount 
changes in interest rates would impact the interest expense on our borrowings bearing variable interest rates  and the interest income derived from our investments  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
foreign currency risk we conduct substantially all of our operations in the prc  and the renminbi is the national currency in which our operations are conducted 
we have not utilized any derivative financial instruments or any other financial instruments  nor do we utilize any derivative commodity instruments in our operations  nor any similar market sensitive instruments 
the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar is subject to the prc government s foreign currency conversion policies  which may change at any time 
the exchange rate at december  was approximately renminbi to us dollar 
the exchange rate at december  was approximately renminbi to us dollar 
the exchange rate is currently permitted to float within a very limited range 
however  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the us dollar 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
inflation in recent years  china has not experienced significant inflation  and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in  and  respectively
