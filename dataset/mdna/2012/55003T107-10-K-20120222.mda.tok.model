item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we believe lumber liquidators has achieved a reputation for offering great value  superior service and a broad selection of high quality hardwood flooring products 
we offer our premium hardwood flooring products under multiple 
table of contents proprietary brands through complementary channels  including store locations  our website  our catalog and a full service call center in toano  virginia 
at december   we operated store locations in states and seven store locations in ontario  canada 
our customer is primarily the existing homeowner  who we believe represents over of our customer count 
the wood flooring market for existing homeowners is dependent on home related  large ticket discretionary spending  which is influenced by a number of complex economic and demographic factors that may vary locally  regionally and nationally 
many of the economic indicators associated with the wood flooring market  and more generally associated with consumer discretionary spending  remain weak 
though we believe we have seen signs of stabilization at historically low levels  we expect the wood flooring market to remain in a weakened state throughout further  we believe a number of macroeconomic factors may result in volatile consumer demand for large ticket  discretionary improvements to the home in as pressures challenging large ticket purchasing decisions continue  we expect the consumer to remain cautious and price sensitive  responding primarily to specific promotions and calls to action 
our market is highly fragmented and includes both national and regional home improvement chains  smaller national specialty flooring chains and a large number of local and regional independent flooring retailers  including a large number of privately owned single site enterprises 
we compete on the basis of price  quality  selection and availability of the wood flooring that we offer our customers  as well as the level of customer service we can provide 
we position ourselves as hardwood flooring experts and believe our high level of customer service reflects this positioning 
substantially all of our proprietary products are purchased directly from mills or associated brokers with whom we have cultivated relationships to ensure a consistent supply of high quality product at the lowest prices 
we believe that our brands  value proposition and integrated multi channel approach are important competitive advantages 
we believe the number of independent retailers serving the homeowner based segment of the wood flooring market will continue to decline  however  presenting us with an opportunity for market share growth  primarily through store base expansion 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our store base in both new and existing markets  domestic and international 
we expect store base growth will drive market productivity and operational efficiencies 
we continue to invest in the infrastructure supporting our store growth and operations 
our focus has been product assortment  in stock inventory position  international and domestic logistics and store management training 
we expect to continue to focus in these areas 
our operations in and were impacted by the implementation of the initial phase of our integrated information technology solution in august this implementation included an enhanced point of sale solution across our entire store base  a warehouse management and inventory control system serving our entire distribution network  an integrated merchandising and product allocation system  and certain related management reporting functionality 
the implementation reduced productivity in our store and warehouse operations 
though we believe our productivity was restored across our operations by the end of the first quarter of  we believe our inconsistent servicing of consumer demand adversely impacted net sales through the first half of a comparison of our six month results in and  to the comparable prior year period  were as follows first six months of second six months of full year in millions  except percentages  number of stores and per share amounts net sales comparable store net sales increase decrease customers invoiced at comparable stores decrease average sale increase average retail price per unit sold increase number of stores opened in period gross margin operating margin net income net income per common share diluted 
table of contents first six months of second six months of full year in millions  except percentages  number of stores and per share amounts net sales comparable store net sales increase decrease customers invoiced at comparable stores increase decrease average sale increase decrease average retail price per unit sold decrease number of stores opened in period gross margin operating margin net income net income per common share diluted approximated by applying our average sale to total net sales at comparable stores average sale is calculated on a total company basis average retail price per unit sold is calculated on a total company basis and excludes certain service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery in the past two years  we have invested in our executive and operational management team  in our integrated information technology solution  and in our product sourcing  allocation and distribution 
during that same time  we aggressively grew our store base to take advantage of market share opportunities in a challenging demand environment for large ticket  discretionary home remodeling spend 
additional resources were required to implement and stabilize a number of these infrastructure initiatives  most notably our integrated information technology solution 
these expenditures  both capital and expense  contracted our efficiency as measured by our annual operating margin 
we believe infrastructure resources required in will be significantly less than and  and as a result  we expect to increase our operational efficiency 
highlights net sales 
our net sales increases in recent years have primarily been a result of our store base growth 
in general  we consider a store non comparable until the first day of the thirteenth month of operation  and comparable thereafter 
from to  our net sales have grown to million 
during those same three years  we opened of our total store locations  and our non comparable stores  as measured each year  drove our net sales increase while comparable store net sales were relatively flat 
during that same time period  catalina estimates that the wood flooring market contracted approximately 
in both and  our total net sales were significantly impacted by the initial implementation of our integrated information technology solution in august in  our net sales grew over  driven by the growth in our non comparable store net sales  which included a total net sales increase of in comparing the first six months of to  and a total net sales increase of in comparing the second six months of to net sales at comparable stores decreased as a result of a decrease in the first six months of compared to  and an increase of in comparing the second six months of to comparing the full year to  the decrease in net sales at comparable stores resulted from a increase in our average sale which was more than offset by a decrease in the number of customers invoiced at comparable stores 
our average sale increased to approximately  in  from approximately  in  primarily due to an increase in the average retail price per unit sold as customers continued to prefer premium products  including merchandise categories with lower than average retail price points 
we believe that the number of customers invoiced was weaker in than  primarily as a result of greater consumer caution with regard to large ticket  discretionary purchases and in the first half of  due to our reduced productivity in serving customer demand 
we have grown our store base rapidly  opening of our store locations in the last five years 
in  we opened locations  split evenly between new and existing markets 
because of the low capital investment to open our new stores 
table of contents and the attractive returns on investment our stores generate  we intend to continue to expand our store base 
we believe our existing primary and secondary metropolitan markets will benefit from additional stores  and certain smaller markets will benefit from our initial entry into the market 
in the coming year  we plan to significantly enhance our focus on optimizing market potential  utilizing both new store openings and a combination of existing store relocation  major remodeling and assortment expansion 
as a result  we expect to slow the growth of our overall new store count in in order to enhance the return on resources invested in a market 
our recent store opening activity is as follows number of stores at january new us stores new canadian stores number of stores at december net sales at our non comparable stores are generally lowest in the first few months after a location is opened  and increase with maturity 
overall  we expect a store s net sales to increase faster during its first three years of operation than in its later years 
store locations opened in existing markets tend to have higher net sales in the first year of operation than store locations opened in new markets  as a portion of those net sales come from more mature stores in the market 
we evaluate our net sales performance by market 
we segregate our markets into those where all stores are comparable and those which have at least one comparable store and one non comparable store  often referred to as cannibalized markets 
in cannibalized markets  we evaluate the total increase in the net sales of the market 
year ended december  dollars in millions total comparable store net sales decrease increase markets with all stores comparable no cannibalization comparable store net sales increase cannibalized markets comparable store net sales decrease percentage decrease non comparable store net sales increase net increase in net sales of cannibalized markets total increase in net sales of cannibalized markets as shown above  though our comparable store net sales were cannibalized million  or  by our opening of non comparable stores in existing markets  we increased the total net sales of those markets by million  or 
cost of sales 
in  and  our gross margin has been  and  respectively 
the key drivers of our gross margin are as follows driver description cost of product cost of acquiring the products we sell from our suppliers  including the impact of our sourcing initiatives  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in the average retail price per unit sold 
transportation international and domestic transportation costs  including the impact of international container rates  customs and duty charges  fuel and fuel surcharges  impact of vendor mill shipments received directly by our store locations  transportation charges from our distribution centers to our store locations  transportation charges between store locations and the cost of delivery to our customers revenue in net sales 
all other investments in our quality control procedures  warranty costs  changes in finishing costs to produce a unit of our proprietary brands  inventory shrink  net costs of producing samples 

table of contents the estimated expansion contraction of our gross margin from the prior year  by key driver  is as follows year ended december  in basis points cost of product transportation all other impact of integrated information technology solution implementation total change in gross margin from the prior year within our cost of product in  gross margin benefited from net sales mix shifts  including increased sales of moldings and accessories and a broadened assortment of engineered hardwoods  and the initial implementation of our sourcing initiatives as described below 
partially offsetting these benefits  additional promotions were required to call a price sensitive customer to action 
within our transportation costs in  gross margin was adversely impacted by higher inbound transportation costs capitalized into our unit cost and an increase in the average cost per mile  partially offset by an increase in direct shipments received by our stores 
within our other costs in  we increased our investment in quality control  sought optimization of in store inventory levels and eliminated certain products which would not be a part of our continuing assortment 
sourcing initiatives 
in  we began a process which will continually challenge the structure of our sourcing relationships with our vendor mill partners and ultimately strengthen our relationships with the best international and domestic partners  and eliminate weaker sources 
our sourcing initiatives play a key role in maintaining the best combination of quality and value in our product assortment and will continue to result in lower net product costs  enabling us to strengthen the value proposition to our customer 
these initiatives are segregated into three primary phases  implemented independently over a multi year time frame  which are as follows vendor mill partners participate to varying levels in a range of continuing programs  including specific promotions designed to create incremental customer traffic  volume based discounts and sharing of certain costs  including marketing  product samples and new store openings 
current and potential vendor mill partners participate in competitive line reviews of specific merchandise categories 
during these line reviews  management and vendor mill partners evaluate breadth of assortment  quality  logistics and product cost to broaden and diversify our supply base  increase product quality and reduce product cost 
through our own international sourcing operations and working directly with our vendor mill partners  we can better control product cost and quality  enhance forecasting and broaden our product assortment 
as aligned with our strategic long term goals  we utilize our balance sheet to control raw material costs through scale not available to our vendor mill partners 
liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   an increase of million from december   as operating activities provided million of net cash compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a reduced build in merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is our most significant asset  and is considered either available for sale or inbound in transit  based on whether we have physically received and inspected the products 
merchandise inventories and available inventory per store in operation on december were as follows in thousands inventory available for sale inventory inbound in transit total merchandise inventories available inventory per store 
table of contents available inventory per store at december  is lower than previous years primarily due to strengthened merchandising  product allocation and distribution initiatives  supported by better information from our integrated information technology solution  and our efforts to drive consumer traffic  particularly late in the fourth quarter 
available inventory per store was elevated at december  primarily due to reduced productivity as a result of the implementation of our integrated information technology solution 
sg a expenses 
labor costs and advertising expenses have historically been our most significant sg a expenses 
our total labor costs have increased as a percentage of net sales over the last three years due primarily to our store base growth and investments in support infrastructure 
our annual advertising costs have increased as we continue to promote our brand and implement direct sales generation programs in support of our growth  offset by national advertising leverage across a larger store base and greater resources committed to our most effective media channels 
our sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales have been  and in  and  respectively 
other external factors impacting our business antidumping and countervailing duties investigation 
in october  a conglomeration of domestic manufacturers of multilayered wood flooring filed a petitions seeking the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties with the united states department of commerce doc and the united states international trade commission itc against imports of multilayered wood flooring from china 
in december  the itc made a preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that imports of multilayered wood flooring from china have caused injury to the domestic suppliers and  as a result  the doc continued its investigation 
on march   the doc announced its preliminary determination in the countervailing duty cvd investigation that chinese producers have received subsidies ranging from zero to 
on may   the doc announced its preliminary determination in the antidumping duty ad investigation  which was subsequently amended on june   and dumping rates ranging from zero to were imposed 
on october   the doc announced its final determinations in both the cvd and ad investigations 
cvd subsidy rates ranged from zero to  and ad rates ranged from zero to 
on november   the itc made its final determination and concluded that imports of multilayered wood flooring from china materially injure  or threaten material injury to  the domestic industry 
thereafter  ad and cvd orders were issued at the final rates determined by the doc 
in  approximately of our net sales were products that fall within the scope of these orders and our current suppliers of the applicable products are subject to cvd rates of either zero or and to ad rates of either zero or 
a number of appeals have been filed by several parties  including us  challenging various aspects of the determinations made by both the itc and doc 
further  annual reviews of the ad and cvd rates will be conducted by the doc in late and such rates may be changed at that time and applied retroactively to the dates of the doc s preliminary rate determinations 
based on the final rates noted above and our current sourcing structure  this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales percentage increase comparable store net sales decrease increase 
table of contents net sales for increased million  or  over due to an increase of million in non comparable store net sales which was offset by a million decrease in comparable store net sales 
in addition to the items discussed in highlights  our net sales have been impacted by the following factors net sales benefited from more consistent in stock positions of certain key product lines  such as laminates  moldings and accessories 
these product lines are included within our never out of stock program through which we have strengthened our in stock commitment to our top selling products by region across all product lines 
these benefits were partially offset by decreased net sales in certain hardwood product lines 
net sales in the third and fourth quarters of were adversely impacted by our reduced productivity subsequent to the august implementation of our integrated information technology solution 
specifically  inconsistent servicing of new demand prior to a customer placing an order interrupted the normal sales cycle  resulting in either delayed or lost sales 
gross profit and gross margin 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin gross profit in increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin increased basis points in as compared to as discussed in highlights  this change was primarily due to the following sales mix shifts from increased sales of moldings and accessories and broadened assortment of engineered hardwoods expanded gross margin 
our sales mix of moldings and accessories increased to of total net sales in  from in as part of our sourcing initiatives in the current year  our vendors participated in a range of continuing programs and we completed several line reviews 
in september  we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of sequoia relating to sequoia s quality control and assurance  product development  claims management and logistics operations in china 
net transportation costs negatively impacted gross margin due primarily to higher inbound transportation costs capitalized into our unit cost and an increase in the average cost per mile 
our international container rates are impacted by negotiated container rates  our mix of shipments to the east coast and west coast of the us and our mix of and containers 
in  our negotiated international container rates were generally comparable to those in  however  certain other inbound transportation costs  primarily duties  continue to rise primarily due to changes in our sales mix toward asian products 
partially offsetting these higher costs was an increase in direct shipments received by our stores  either direct from the mill or through our china consolidation center 
in  of our unit purchases were received directly at the store  up from in transportation costs of moving our products from our warehouses to the final sales floor increased due to a per mile increase  primarily resulting from increases in fuel surcharges  partially offset by fewer road miles traveled 
increased investment in our quality control procedures  particularly those related to south american exotic hardwoods  increased certain product costs 
we significantly strengthened our inspection efforts over milling in the country of origin 
we believe that  over time  these efforts will benefit gross profit through a stronger customer value proposition 
in  primarily in the fourth quarter  we took steps to optimize inventory levels through regional assortment planning  eliminating certain product lines which would not be a part of continuing inventory and the implementation of stricter procedures to eliminate residual liquidation inventory

net sales were impacted by the following the loss of productivity following our system implementation in august weakened net sales at comparable stores in the second half of as a result  we reversed a trend in quarterly net sales  which had gradually strengthened each quarter since the beginning of in the first six months of  our net sales in comparable stores increased compared to the six months ended june  in contrast  when comparing the third and fourth quarters of to the same six months in  our net sales at comparable stores decreased 
on a quarterly basis  net sales at comparable stores decreased in comparing the third quarters of and  and increased when comparing the fourth quarters of and net sales for benefited from an increase in the number of customers invoiced in our comparable stores 
we believe the increases in the number of customers invoiced resulted from strengthening consumer demand for our expanded assortment of products  and the incremental traffic generated by certain promotional pricing 
the loss of productivity following the system implementation significantly impacted the number of customers invoiced compared to the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores in the first half of increased compared to the first half of however  in comparing the second half of the year  the number of customers invoiced decreased from to our monthly comparisons of customers invoiced in comparable stores were negative from august through november and returned positive in december  where increased over our average sale in declined in comparison to we believe the decrease in our average sale for the full year was a result of consumer demand shifting our mix of products sold  or sales mix  to certain key product lines which generally had a lower than average retail price per unit 
we believe we grew our market share in these product lines 
however  the average sale increased each quarter in  from a low of  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
in  the average sale had fallen each quarter  from  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter comparison of  in to  in represented the first year over year increase since the second quarter of the gradual strengthening of our average sale in was also a result of changes in our sales mix  including demand for our hardwood products 
net sales benefited from more consistent in stock positions of certain key product lines  including product lines customers expected to be in stock at a store location  such as laminates  moldings and accessories

table of contents gross profit in increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin decreased basis points in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to increased product costs resulting primarily from the following our loss of productivity subsequent to the system implementation resulted in less efficient unit flow  including expedited transportation  and reduced gross margin by approximately to basis points 
transportation costs of moving our products from our warehouses in virginia to the store locations  between store locations  and to the customer from our store locations are charged to cost of sales as incurred 
these costs increased due to both a per mile increase  primarily due to increases in fuel surcharges  and an increase in the number of miles driven  primarily due to a greater number of units shipped 
the increase in units shipped primarily resulted from a combination of our increase in sales volume  including the sales mix shift to a lower average retail price  and generally higher in store average inventory levels 
inbound transportation costs capitalized into the unit cost of products sold were generally higher in than in international container rates reached a low point against our historic norm in the second half of  rose to a peak well above our historic norm in the summer of and fell back to approximate our historic norm thereafter 
partially offsetting these transportation cost increases were increased direct shipments received by our stores  either through our china consolidation center or direct from the mill to the store 
in  of our unit purchases were received directly at the store  up from in in the second half of  these direct shipments represented of our unit purchases  up from in the second half of our efforts to expand and regionalize our assortment of bellawood products resulted in per unit finishing costs generally higher than those in  primarily due to greater demand for products which were less efficient to finish 
in aggregate  sales mix shifts were neutral to gross margin  including gross margin benefited from our continued efforts to broaden the assortment and strengthen the in stock positions of moldings and accessories  as well as laminates and certain engineered hardwoods  particularly the premium products 
these product lines generally carried a higher than average gross margin 
gross margin was adversely impacted by a strengthening in consumer demand for certain hardwoods  particularly those at the entry level  which generally carry higher than average retail price points  but lower than average gross margins

contractual commitments and contingencies our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period total less than year to years to years years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations included in this table is the base period or current renewal period for our operating leases 
the operating leases generally contain varying renewal provisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or other financing activities with special purpose entities 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements recognition of net sales we recognize net sales for products purchased at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
we recognize service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery  when the service has been rendered 
we report revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities 
net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical sales trends and experience 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in the assumptions underlying our allowance estimates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
in addition  customers who do not take immediate delivery of their purchases are generally required to leave a deposit of up to of the retail sales amount with the balance payable when the products are delivered 
these customer deposits benefit our cash flow and return on investment capital  because we receive partial payment for our customers purchases immediately 
we record these deposits as a liability on our balance sheet under the line item customer deposits and store credits until the customer takes possession of the merchandise 

table of contents merchandise inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of merchandise cost or market value 
we determine merchandise cost using the average cost method 
all of the hardwood flooring we purchase from suppliers is either prefinished or unfinished  and in immediate saleable form 
to the extent that we finish and box unfinished products  we include those costs in the average unit cost of related merchandise inventory 
in determining market value  we make judgments and estimates as to the market value of our products  based on factors such as historical results and current sales trends 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in those assumptions in the future may require us to record charges for losses or obsolescence against these assets  but would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
stock based compensation we currently maintain a single equity incentive plan under which we may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted shares and other equity awards to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize expense for our stock based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the service period of the related stock based compensation award 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes merton valuation model 
in order to determine the related stock based compensation expense  we used the following assumptions for stock options granted during expected life of years  expected stock price volatility of  risk free interest rates from to  and dividends are not expected to be paid in any year 
the expected stock price volatility range is based on the historical volatilities of companies included in a peer group that was selected by management whose shares or options are publicly available 
the volatilities are estimated for a period of time equal to the expected life of the related option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield of us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is determined by considering the contractual terms  vesting schedule and expectations of future employee behavior 
had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options  our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued guidance that revises the requirements around how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount  a quantitative calculation would not be needed 
we will adopt this guidance for our fiscal annual goodwill impairment test 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the guidance requires entities to report the components of comprehensive income in either a single  continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
we early adopted this guidance for our fiscal financial statements  and have presented the components of comprehensive income in a separate but consecutive statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less 
changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn  and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would be exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable rate of the facility 

table of contents we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
exchange rate risk 
the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar and chinese yuan 
we currently do not engage in any exchange rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
