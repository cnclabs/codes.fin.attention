recent events on november   amr corporation  the parent company of american airlines  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the airline announced that it and its regional affiliate american eagle would continue to operate as usual  fly their normal schedules  honor reservations and make exchanges and refunds 
we have outstanding receivables for spare parts owed by american airlines  for which we have adequately reserved 
in december of  we completed negotiations with employees represented by the speea wtpu 
the new contract that was ratified in december of is in effect until january  speea represents about  of our professional and technical non engineering employees in wichita 
on january   we successfully delivered the first composite center fuselage section for the airbus a xwb program 
the upper and lower shell section composite fuselage panels were joined in our saint nazaire  france  facility before being delivered to airbus 
on january   we drew down million from our revolving credit facility to fund short term working capital needs 
historically  cyclical cash flows dictate lower cash balances during the first quarter of the year 
on february   the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace speea filed two identical unfair labor practice ulp charges against the company  one on behalf of each of the two bargaining units it represents  the wichita engineering unit weu and the wichita technical and professionals unit wtpu 
the ulps claim that the company has modified working conditions related to a performance improvement process without negotiating with speea 
speea represents approximately employees in the wichita engineering unit and approximately  employees in the wichita technical and professional unit 
the company intends to vigorously defend its position and is evaluating the impact to its financial position  results of operations and liquidity position resulting from this matter 
overview we are one of the largest independent non oem original equipment manufacturer aircraft parts designers and manufacturers of commercial aerostructures in the world  based on annual revenues  as well as the largest independent supplier of aerostructures to boeing 
in addition  we are one of the largest independent suppliers of aerostructures to airbus 
boeing and airbus are the two largest aircraft oems in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial and military aircraft 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which includes forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which includes nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components  and wing systems  which includes wings  wing components  flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts 
all other activities fall within the all other 
table of contents segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other companies that have operations in wichita  kansas 
the fuselage systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita  kansas and kinston  north carolina  with an assembly plant in saint nazaire  france for the a xwb program 
the propulsion systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in wichita  kansas 
the wing systems segment manufactures products at our facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma  prestwick  scotland  subang  malaysia and kinston  north carolina 
fuselage systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and less than  respectively  of our net revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the global industry s revenue rebounded sharply in for both passenger air traffic and cargo freight  after significant contraction in and one key near term variable affecting the industry is fuel costs 
if fuel costs were to rise near the recent highs of  airlines might respond with canceled or deferred orders 
however  boeing and airbus have indicated that they do not anticipate any near term erosion to their backlogs 
both oem s have announced multiple production rate increases  which commenced in with the respective single aisle programs airbus a and boeing b 
demand for commercial aerostructures is highly correlated to demand for new aircraft 
from through  boeing and airbus experienced an unprecedented order intake and backlog growth 
in that period  the two manufacturers obtained combined total gross orders of approximately  aircraft 
their aggregate backlog increased from nearly  to over  aircraft 
an order slowdown in resulted in a decrease in aggregate backlog 
however  net orders for rebounded from the previous year 
commercial net orders were  in  resulting in a backlog increase of aircraft 
this trend continued in with net orders of  resulting in a backlog increase of  aircraft 
high backlog levels are expected to continue to drive increasing production and delivery forecasts in the near to mid term from both boeing and airbus 
the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through and delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced that it expects its deliveries to be approximately aircraft 
airbus announced that it expects its deliveries to be approximately in new program inventory inventory continues to grow in terms of absolute dollars and remains stable as a percentage of total assets 
inventory as a percentage of total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
this overall trend in inventory is driven primarily by our contractually required investments in new programs  which include the boeing b  b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for an increase in inventory from to of million  which is net of forward loss charges of million  million  million and million recorded in on our b  sikorsky ch k  g and a xwb non recurring wing contracts  respectively 
the increases in inventory for new programs in the last few years are a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting with regard to inventory and revenue recognition 
under this method  investments in new contracts  including contractual pre production costs and recurring production costs in excess of the projected average cost to manufacture all units in the contract block  initially accumulate in inventory for the related contract 
once production has reached a 
table of contents point where the cost to produce a ship set falls below such projected average cost  the inventory balance for such program will begin to decrease 
as many of our new programs are either in the pre production phase or the early stages of recurring production  we expect that inventory balances will continue to increase in deferred inventory costs are evaluated for recoverability through their inclusion in the total costs used in the calculation of each contract s estimated profit margin 
when the estimated total contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues  an inventory reserve is established 
new program performance we are currently performing work on several new programs  which are in various stages of development 
several of these programs entered flight testing in  including the gulfstream g and gulfstream g  which includes the rolls royce br the boeing b and boeing b have each received faa and jaa certifications  as well as easa certification for entry into service  and each program has made first aircraft deliveries to the final customer 
we are delivering revenue generating production units on all of these programs 
in  we delivered two revenue generating test articles on the sikorsky ch k helicopter program 
we expect to deliver the remaining test articles by the first quarter of these new programs continue to pose a risk of additional charges and or forward loss given the low margins that are currently forecasted and cost pressures that continued throughout this was a challenging year for some of our new programs as we experienced difficulties in achieving estimated cost targets 
as described in more detail below in results of operations  in the first quarter of  we recorded a forward loss charge of million on the sikorsky ch k helicopter program associated with the decision to proceed with a more traditional design and build approach to manufacture the remaining test units 
in the third quarter of  we recorded an additional forward loss charge of million associated with our decision to in source certain parts that were previously out sourced 
these forward loss charges were offset in the fourth quarter by a million pricing settlement with the customer as we achieved a positive outcome on outstanding pricing negotiations 
we expect performance on the sikorsky ch k program to improve as we move through the initial development phase 
cost growth continues to be a risk  but we are working closely with our manufacturing and assembly teams to implement plans to mitigate further losses 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a forward loss charge of million on our g wing program as a result of additional manufacturing cost growth and the inclusion of estimated costs related to our decision to move the manufacturing of wing components on that program to kinston  north carolina 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional forward loss charge of million associated with the new manufacturing plan and higher than forecasted assembly and supply chain costs 
recognition of an additional forward loss on these programs continues to be a significant risk and is dependent upon several factors  including our market forecast for these aircraft  our ability to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans  achievement of forecasted cost reductions as we enter into production and our ability to successfully resolve claims and assertions 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million forward loss charge on the b fuselage and a million forward loss charge on the b wing components  as that program has experienced manufacturing cost growth in the early production stage 
in  we lowered our estimated margin on the g program to near break even  as that program has experienced cost growth as it progresses through the development stage and moves towards faa certification 
our estimated margin on the initial rolls royce br contract is expected to remain at zero until we are able to realize important cost reduction opportunities 
on may   spirit and boeing entered into the b amendment  which settled certain claims and assertions associated with the development and production of the b airplane 
among other things  the b amendment settled a major portion of our b development claims and included an agreement by both parties for annual price adjustment reviews beginning in and revised change provisions and cost recovery plan 
as significant terms were included in the estimate process  the b amendment did not have a material impact on the contract profitability estimates as our contract accounting assumptions 
table of contents for those uncertainties were consistent with the ultimate agreement with boeing 
the b contract profitability will depend upon our ability to achieve cost reduction opportunities as we increase production levels in the coming months and years 
contract estimates are expected to remain at break even margins until we are able to realize these important cost reduction opportunities 
should we not realize these expected cost savings  future forward losses on this contract could be recognized 
we also continue to support the development of the a xwb fuselage and wing programs 
maintaining profit projections on these programs is dependent upon the program schedule 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a forward loss charge of million on the a xwb wing non recurring contract associated with increasing engineering change costs 
the a xwb program could experience significant cost growth if the program schedule experiences delays 
our contract estimates on the non recurring portion of the a xwb wing contract continues to reflect zero margins as we experienced cost growth in the next twelve to eighteen months will be a critical time for all of these development programs as we manufacture the initial units and establish baseline performance for the recurring cost structure 
recognition of additional forward losses in future periods continues to be a significant risk and will depend upon several factors including our market forecast  our ability to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans  achievement of forecasted cost reductions as we enter into production and our ability to successfully resolve claims and assertions with our customers and supply chain partners  see risk factors risk factors related to our business and industry 
basis of presentation the financial statements include spirit s financial statements and the financial statements of its majority owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
investments in business entities in which we do not have control  but have the ability to exercise influence over operating and financial policies  are accounted for by the equity method 
kansas industrial energy supply company kiesc  a tenancy in common with other wichita companies established to purchase natural gas  is fully consolidated as spirit owns of the entity s equity 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company s uk subsidiary uses local currency  the british pound  as its functional currency  the malaysian subsidiary uses the british pound and our singapore subsidiary uses the singapore dollar 
all other foreign subsidiaries and branches use the us dollar as their functional currency 
as part of the monthly consolidation process  the functional currency is translated to us dollars using the end of month currency translation rate for balance sheet accounts and average period currency translation rates for revenue and income accounts as defined by fasb authoritative guidance on foreign currency translation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of the company s revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
the company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
the units of delivery method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period and as the cost of earned revenue the costs allocable to the delivered units  costs allocable to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventory 
the method is used in circumstances in which an entity produces units of a basic product under production type contracts in a continuous or sequential production process to buyers specifications 
recurring long term production contracts are usually divided into contract blocks for this purpose  with each block treated as a separate contract for units of delivery production type contract accounting purposes 
the total quantity of production units to be delivered under a contract may be set as a single contract accounting block  or it can be split into multiple blocks 
unless the life of the contract is so long that it prevents reliable estimates  the entire contract quantity will typically be set as the contract accounting block quantity 
life of program  or requirements based contracts often lead to continuing sales of more than twenty years 
since this is much longer than can be reliably estimated  we use parameters based on the contract facts and circumstances to determine the length of the contract block 
this analysis includes considering the customer s firm orders  internal assessment of the market  reliabilities of cost estimates  potential segmentation of non recurring elements of the contract  and other factors 
contract block sizes may also be determined based on certain contractual terms such as pricing renegotiation dates such that certain contract blocks may use an approximate date instead of a defined unit quantity in order to increase the ability to estimate accurately given that the renegotiated pricing is unknown for the planning block 
shorter contract blocks for mature  ongoing programs are common due to the presence of recent cost history and probable forecast accuracy 
mature program contract blocks tend to be approximately two years in length 
initial contract blocks often require a longer time period and greater number of units in order to take into account the higher cost of early units due to a steeper experience curve and pre production design costs 
initial contract blocks on new programs can extend up to ten years 
as these programs mature and efficiencies are realized  subsequent contract block length shortens to take into account the steady state of the continuing production 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones or use of the cost to cost method  that are indicative of our progress toward completion depending on facts and circumstances 
we follow the requirements of fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impacts of revisions in estimates are recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs over a contract block 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the 
table of contents contract 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contract blocks span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
estimates of profit margins for contract accounting blocks are typically reviewed on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under the contract block are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract block 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract block as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised  which we refer to as cumulative catch up adjustments 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and total contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract  known as a forward loss charge  is recorded to cost of sales in the period in which it becomes evident 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenues earned from providing maintenance services including any contracted research and development are recognized when the service is complete or other contractual milestones are attained 
since boeing retained title to tooling assets obtained as part of the boeing acquisition and provides such tooling to the company at no cost  the company treats the amortization of boeing owned tooling as a reduction to revenues as required by fasb authoritative guidance on consideration given by a vendor to a customer  including resellers of the vendor s product 
these items are netted against revenues in calculating net revenues 
in  the company recognized no reductions to gross revenues for boeing tooling  as the tooling became fully amortized in under an agreement with airbus  certain payments that are also accounted for as consideration given by a vendor to a customer will be amortized as a reduction to net revenues beginning in a significant portion of the company s future revenues is expected to be derived from new programs  on which we may be contracted to provide design and engineering services  recurring production  or both 
there are several risks inherent to such new programs 
in the design and engineering phase  we may incur costs in excess of our forecasts due to several factors  including cost overruns  customer directed change orders and delays in the overall program 
we may also incur higher than expected recurring production costs  which may be caused by a variety of factors  including the future impact of engineering changes or other change orders or our inability to secure contracts with our suppliers at projected cost levels 
our ability to recover these excess costs from the customer will depend on several factors  including our rights under our contracts for the new programs 
in determining our profits and losses in accordance with the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  we are required to make significant assumptions regarding our future costs  as well as the estimated number of units to be manufactured under the contract and other variables 
we continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience 
if we make material changes to our assumptions  such as a reduction in the estimated number of units to be produced under the contract which could be caused by emerging market trends or other factors  an increase in future production costs or a change in the recoverability of increased design or production costs  we may experience negative cumulative catch up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized 
in some cases  we may recognize forward loss amounts 
for a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new programs  see risk factors risk factors related to our business and industry 

table of contents inventory raw materials are stated at lower of cost principally on an actual or average cost basis or market 
inventoried costs attributed to units delivered under long term contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the actual plus anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period the loss becomes known  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
costs in inventory include amounts relating to contracts with long production cycles  some of which are not expected to be realized within one year 
the company reviews its general stock materials and spare parts inventory each quarter to identify impaired inventory  including excess or obsolete inventory  based on historical sales trends and expected production usage 
impaired inventories are written off to work in process in the period identified 
work in process inventory includes deferred production costs for the excess of production costs over the estimated average cost per ship set  and credit balances for favorable variances on contracts between actual costs incurred and the estimated average cost per ship set for units delivered under the current production blocks 
recovery of excess over average deferred production costs is dependent on the number of ship sets ultimately sold and the ultimate selling prices and lower production costs associated with future production under these contract blocks 
work in process inventory also includes non recurring production costs 
non recurring production costs include design and engineering costs and test articles 
finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
capitalized pre production costs include certain contract costs  including applicable overhead  incurred before a product is manufactured on a recurring basis 
significant customer directed work changes can also cause pre production costs to be incurred 
these costs are typically recovered over a certain number of ship set deliveries 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized 
tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for tax credits 
under this method  tax credits reduce income tax expense 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on employers accounting for pensions  post retirement benefits other than pensions  defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans see note  pension and other post retirement benefits  for additional detail on these plans 

table of contents assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted fasb authoritative guidance which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours  which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans that include restricted share grants and restricted stock units

net revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with net revenues of  million for the prior year 
the increase in net revenues in as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of million of deferred revenue for non recurring work on b derivative and mission improvement dmi for pricing adjustments on prior and current year deliveries all resulting from the b amendment  which was finalized in may in addition  we recorded approximately million of higher production volume driven by customer delivery schedules and approximately million of

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in non recurring revenue 
net revenues generated from our business jet programs increased during as we delivered more production ship sets 
non recurring revenues  which includes design and development efforts  decreased during as we transitioned to full production on multiple platforms 
deliveries to boeing increased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year  as ship set deliveries increased across all boeing programs driven by customer delivery schedules 
deliveries to airbus increased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year due to increased deliveries across all airbus programs driven by customer delivery schedule

in  we recorded a favorable million cumulative catch up adjustment related to periods prior to driven by productivity improvements  recognition of favorable performance as we closed out b and b contract blocks in the fourth quarter  and a lower forecast for our short term incentive accrual  partially offset by increasing material costs in our wing systems segment 
in addition  we continue to record zero margins on the b program  for which deliveries have increased in the current year 
in comparison  in the same period of  we recorded million associated with the shares granted to eligible iam represented employees upon the ratification of a new ten year agreement  million in early retirement incentives also associated with the ten year iam agreement  and million associated with shares granted to eligible uaw represented employees at the ratification of a new ten year contract 
we updated our contract profitability estimates resulting in an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million driven by a million charge on our hawker xp contract related to the decision to exit the program  million unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment related to periods prior to on our sikorsky ch k contract as a result of additional costs required to meet test hardware schedules  and million recorded in the propulsion segment primarily due to a comprehensive analysis of our b contract in the fourth quarter of  during which we revised our contract estimates to reflect a break even margin  partially offset by favorable performance trends on mature programs 
we also recorded a million forward loss charge for tooling contracts for the g program in sg a  research and development 
combined sg a and research and development costs as a percentage of net revenues was for the twelve months ended  compared to in the prior year 
sg a expense increased million for the twelve months ended december   or  primarily due to increase in stock compensation expense of million related to grants awarded in  as compared to million during the prior year 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  were down million  or compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the b amendment  which resulted in a change in the treatment of advances for non recurring work previously recorded as research and development expense to inventory contract cost 
in addition  we had fewer research and development expense was lower due to planned delays of several technology development projects underway in versus operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december  was million  which was relatively flat compared to operating income of million for the prior year 
operating income in was favorably impacted by improved operating margins resulting from higher overall production and aftermarket volume  the impact related to the favorable cumulative catch up  and 
table of contents the favorable impact of the change in treatment of advances for non recurring work previously recorded as research and development expense to inventory contract costs caused by the b amendment 
this was partially offset by the forward loss charges on our g wing  sikorsky ch k helicopter  b and the a xwb non recurring wing contract  a charge to replenish the warranty and extraordinary rework reserve  costs associated with early retirement incentives  and higher stock compensation expense as discussed above 
the adjustments related to the b amendment did not contribute to overall operating income as profitability margins on that program are break even  however  they negatively impacted operating margins as a percentage of net revenues for interest expense and financing fee amortization 
interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended december  includes million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs  as compared to million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense associated with long term debt in was primarily driven by interest accrued on our notes and on our senior secured term loan as amended in the decrease in deferred financing costs was related to an adjustment recorded in to reflect the maturity dates of our term loan and revolving credit facilities over which deferred financing is amortized 
interest income 
interest income for the twelve months ended december  and december  was million 
other income expense 
other income expense for included income of million primarily due to income from the kdfa bonds  partially offset by losses due to foreign exchange rates on intercompany activity and borrowings  as compared to expense of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in other income was driven primarily by the comparatively favorable foreign exchange rates  in  on debt denominated in currencies other than the borrowing entities functional currency  as compared to the prior year  partially offset by bad debt expense and loss on the disposal of assets 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises

twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  million  an increase of million  or  compared with net revenues of  million for the prior year 
the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in ship set deliveries in for the boeing b as compared to  as the lingering effects of the iam strike at boeing impacted the first quarter deliveries 
in addition  deliveries for the boeing b also increased driven by customer delivery schedule 
non recurring revenues  which are derived primarily from engineering and design efforts  were million and million for each of the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
favorable volume based pricing adjustments of million were recorded in as a result of lower deliveries due to the iam strike at boeing as compared with million of such adjustments recorded during the same period of the strengthening dollar during resulted in an million decrease in the value of net revenues from spirit europe 
deliveries to boeing increased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year  mostly due to increases in b and b ship set deliveries  partially offset by a decrease in b ship set deliveries driven by customer delivery schedule 
deliveries to airbus decreased by to ship sets during compared to ship sets delivered in the prior year due to a customer delivery re phasing at spirit europe which reduced third quarter a deliveries 
we re aligned with customer a delivery levels in the fourth quarter of in total  ship set deliveries decreased to ship sets in compared to  ship sets for the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to reduced deliveries of hawker  a and a ship sets  which are not a significant source of revenue  partially offset by increased boeing ship set deliveries 
approximately of spirit s net revenues for came from our two largest customers  boeing and airbus 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues was for the twelve months ended december   as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in is primarily due to the absence of unusual charges recorded in  consisting of million related to a forward loss on our g contract and the cessna citation columbus program termination  as well as an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million in during  we recorded expenses of approximately million associated with the shares granted to eligible iam represented employees at the ratification of a new ten year agreement on june   million in early retirement incentives accepted by iam represented employees in the third quarter of also in accordance with the new ten year contract  and million associated with shares granted to eligible uaw represented employees at the ratification of a new ten year contract on december  we updated our contract profitability estimates resulting in an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million driven by a million charge on our hawker xp contract related to the decision to exit the program  million unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment related to periods prior to on our sikorsky ch k contract as a result of additional costs required to meet test hardware schedules  and million recorded in the propulsion segment primarily driven by the fourth quarter of comprehensive analysis of our contract  during which we revised our contract estimates to reflect a break even margin  partially offset by favorable performance trends on mature programs 
we also recorded a million forward loss charge for tooling contracts for the g program in in addition to these specific charges  we continue to experience lower profitability on follow on production blocks that began in the fourth quarter of in january  we adopted a change in accounting estimate which extended the useful lives of certain assets 
the effect of this change was a decrease in depreciation charges of million to inventory for  which will eventually flow through cost of sales following the process for contract accounting

in june  the company amended its credit facility which resulted in an increase in amortized deferred financing costs 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily driven by interest on the senior unsecured notes issued at the end of the third quarter in  partially offset by interest incurred on the drawn portion of the revolver in the increase in deferred financing fees was primarily the result of a full year discount amortization in on the notes issued in the third quarter of interest income 
interest income for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period in the prior year  which included million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable from boeing for capital expense reimbursement pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the boeing acquisition 
the last of these payments for capital reimbursement was made by boeing to the company in other income expense 
other income expense for included expense of million due to changes in foreign exchange rates on intercompany activity and borrowings  as compared to income of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in expense was driven primarily by the intercompany payable from spirit europe to spirit related to our a xwb program  as well as trade payables and borrowings 
should these balances increase  they will be more susceptible to changes in exchange rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity include cash on hand  cash flow from operations  which include advance payments and receivables from customers  borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our bond issuances 
our liquidity requirements are driven by our long cycle business model 
our business model is comprised of four to six year non recurring investment periods  which include design and development efforts  followed by ten to twenty years of recurring production 
the non recurring investment periods require significant outflows of cash as we design the product  build tooling  purchase equipment and build initial production inventories 
these activities are typically funded partially through customer advances and milestone payments  which are offset against revenue as production units are delivered in the case of customer advances  or recognized as revenue as milestones are achieved in the case of milestone payments 
the remaining funds needed to support non recurring programs come from predictable cash inflows from our mature programs that are in the recurring phase of the production cycle 
occasionally  we have utilized borrowings and other sources of cash to fund non recurring investments during periods where cash received from our customers is not adequate to fund our purchase commitments 
the non recurring investment period typically ends concurrently with initial deliveries of completed aircraft by our customers  which indicates that a program has entered into the recurring production phase 
when a program reaches steady recurring production  it typically results in long term generation of cash from operations 
as part of our business model  we continuously add new non recurring programs  which are supported by mature programs that are in the steady recurring phase of the production cycle to promote growth 
in  we had multiple programs in the non recurring investment phase requiring capital investment that was funded by cash from operations and cash from our senior notes issued in and during the year  several of these programs  including the b and b  moved into the production phase and began generating cash inflows in additional programs are expected to complete their non recurring phase and enter into the recurring production phase in as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  which is net of million in letters of credit 
we had no outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility at the end of on january   we drew down million from our revolving credit facility to fund short term working capital needs 
historically  cyclical cash flows dictate lower cash balances during the first quarter of the year 
based on our planned levels of operations and our strong liquidity position  we currently expect that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  inventory growth as discussed below  planned capital investments  research and development expenditures and scheduled debt service payments for at least the next twelve months

for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of million from operating activities  an increase in the use of cash of million  compared to a net cash inflow of million for the prior year 
operating cash consumption increased year over year by approximately million driven by continued growth in inventory to support engineering development and start up production costs for new programs as well as costs for ramp up activities for increasing build rates on several boeing programs 
in addition  we paid million in profit sharing in  which was included in inventory  compared to zero paid for cash receipts increased year over year by approximately million driven by additional revenue from unit deliveries and aftermarket volume 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a deferred revenue payment of million as part of the memorandum of agreement that led to the b amendment 
the million net cash outflow for the twelve months ended december  was largely the result of approximately billion in expenditures driven by continued growth in inventory to support engineering development and start up production costs for new programs  including the b  a xwb and gulfstream programs  and for ramp up activities for increasing build rates on the b and b programs  partially offset by cash receipts of approximately billion driven by revenue from unit deliveries  which increased across all boeing and airbus models  and aftermarket volume 
the million net cash inflow in was largely due to cash receipts of approximately billion driven by revenue from unit deliveries and the receipt of a deferred revenue payment of million in the fourth quarter of as part of the memorandum of agreement that led to the b amendment  partially offset by expenditures of approximately billion primarily for inventory 
the revenue we recognized upon delivery of b ship sets in the first nine months of and for the twelve months of did not result in cash receipts  resulting instead in the liquidation of customer advances 
cash payments for b units resumed in the third quarter of

for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash inflow of million from operating activities  an increase of million compared to a net cash outflow of million for the same period in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily driven by an increase in cash receipts from unit deliveries combined with a deferred revenue payment of million as part of the memorandum of agreement that led to the b amendment  partially offset by the slowing of new program inventory growth on programs other than b which is ramping up production 
this overall improvement was partially offset by a decrease in advance payments as increased deliveries of the b liquidated advances previously received  and a decline in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in in  we benefited from a change in accounts payable terms which occurred in the first quarter of our overall trend of inventory growth is driven primarily by our contractually required investments in new programs which include the boeing b  gulfstream g and g  airbus a xwb  sikorsky ch k and rolls royce br programs 
the contracts for these new programs accounted for an increase in inventory in of million  as compared to an increase of million in we expect these programs will continue to drive inventory growth as we incur additional up front costs to produce initial units  which traditionally have a higher cost

investing activities 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of million from investing activities  an increase in outflow of million  as compared to a net cash outflow of million for the same period in the prior year 
the primary driver in the increased use of cash between periods was the final payment of the long term receivable from boeing in december  which resulted in a cash benefit of million in with no corresponding benefit in during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  software and program tooling  which was million higher than during the same period in the prior year  as the result of set up of our facilities in kinston  north carolina and saint nazaire  france

tax incentive bonds 
both spirit and the predecessor utilized city of wichita issued industrial revenue bonds irbs to finance self constructed and purchased real and personal property at the wichita site 
the bonds issued in      and mature ten years from issuance while the bonds issued in through mature years after their issuance 
tax benefits associated with irbs include provisions for a ten year complete property tax abatement and a kansas department of revenue sales tax exemption on all irb funded purchases 
spirit and the predecessor purchased these irbs  so they are both bondholders and debtor lessee for the property purchased with the irb proceeds 
therefore  we offset the amounts invested and obligations for these bonds on a consolidated basis 
certain predecessor property that was subject to predecessor owned irbs continues to be subject to those irbs 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  the predecessor assigned its leasehold interest in irb funded assets and the related bonds to a special purpose trust beneficially owned by boeing which subleases these assets to spirit 
pursuant to the sublease terms  the special purpose trust will purchase the assets from the city of wichita  terminate the leases between the city and the predecessor  redeem the bonds  and transfer the assets to spirit when these assets cease to qualify for the ten year property tax abatement 
the face value for the bonds subleased from the special purpose trust is approximately million 
in addition  spirit obtained irbs in     and with a million aggregate principal amount 
spirit redeemed million of irbs issued in in we have an incentive agreement with the kansas department of commerce  pursuant to which the kansas development finance authority kdfa issued bonds and provided loans to finance eligible projects 
the program s purpose is to provide us with incentives to invest in the state of kansas 
to induce this investment  the kansas department of revenue will rebate certain payroll taxes until the bonds are redeemed or mature 
pursuant to offset provisions in the underlying debt instruments  there are no principal or interest cash payments associated with the bonds 
as debtor  spirit offsets the amount owed to its wholly owned subsidiary  spirit aerosystems finance  inc  as bondholder 
therefore  we may offset the amounts invested and obligations for these bonds on a consolidated basis 
the million in debt instruments will expire in december

this could significantly influence the interest rate of any future debt financings 
a debt security credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold a security 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings 
accordingly  each rating should be considered independent of other ratings

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases disclosed in the notes to our financial statements included in this annual report  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  tax we establish reserves in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited 
we recognize the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit s progress  case law developments  and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that with an million long term payable  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a non current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog as of december   our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft  regional jet  business jet  and military equipment deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  was approximately billion 
this is an increase of billion from our corresponding estimate as of the end of reflecting the fact that airbus and boeing new orders exceeded deliveries in backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing and airbus announced backlog on our supply agreements 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  our expected backlog as of december  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period 
foreign operations we engage in business in various non us markets 
as of december   we have a foreign subsidiary with one facility in the united kingdom  which serves as a production facility  an assembly facility in malaysia  a worldwide supplier base  and a repair center for the european and middle eastern regions 
we purchase certain components and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers  including airbus  or resold to foreign end users ie  foreign airlines and militaries 
in addition  we have built a new assembly facility in saint nazaire  france to receive and assemble center fuselage frame sections for the airbus a xwb commercial aircraft from the facility in kinston  north carolina before they are shipped to airbus 
the new facility began operations in spirit is party to a joint venture operation with russian based progresstech ltd

table of contents currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments countries 
furthermore  the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our net revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or  of total net revenues for the same period 
inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit s contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars 
spirit europe s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling or euros 
in some cases  our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
although the raw material industry is experiencing a softening in demand  some specific materials have yet to reflect a corresponding reduction in price 
we expect that raw material market pricing volatility will remain a factor that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities  we are exposed to various market risks that may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
these market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay on our variable rate debt 
other than the interest rate swaps described below  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  the funds in which our pension assets are invested  and trade accounts receivable 
accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers  amounts earned but unbilled  particular estimated contract changes  claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery  and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our net revenues were from sales to boeing 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 

table of contents we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in liquid short term money market funds 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 
commodity price risks some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing and airbus 
these collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from market volatility across the industry for certain specialized metallic and composite raw materials used in the aerospace industry 
although our supply agreements with boeing and airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing pricing increases for metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium despite softening market demand across the industry 
although the demand pressure has been somewhat eased for certain metallic and composite raw materials  the specialized nature of the materials used in the aerospace industry has prevented a corresponding decrease in prices 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we continue to review a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
interest rate risks after the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as compared to million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest that varies with libor 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve months of approximately million 

table of contents we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements periodically 
as of december   the interest swap agreements had notional amounts totaling million 
notional amount expires variable rate fixed rate effective fixed rate fair value  december  march month libor june month libor july month libor total the fixed rate represents the rate at which interest is paid by the company pursuant to the terms of its interest rate swap agreements 
the effective term b fixed interest rate represents the fixed rate of the derivative instrument plus the basis point margin on the pro rata share of term b and basis points margin on the pro rata share of term b above the variable libor borrowing rate we pay on the term b loan 
the purpose of entering into these swaps was to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fair value of the swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet as an asset  if positive  or a liability  if negative 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million at december  the company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of all estimated fair values 
the company has applied these valuation techniques at year end and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
the company attempts to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions which are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign exchange risks the company had foreign currency hedge transactions in place as of december  for the b and b programs 
the company did not enter into any new foreign currency hedge transactions during as a result of the bae acquisition  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in british pounds sterling 
spirit europe s functional currency is the british pound sterling 
however  sales of spirit europe s products to boeing and some procurement costs are denominated in us dollars and euros 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause net sales and our expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate british pound sterling denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly 
table of contents affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity

the mark to market values of these debt securities are recorded through the consolidated statement of operations on a monthly basis in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on investments debt and equity securities disclosures 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  the intercompany revolving credit facility with spirit europe is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the fluctuation in rates for resulted in a loss of million reflected in other income expense 
other than the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts  we have no other derivative financial instruments
