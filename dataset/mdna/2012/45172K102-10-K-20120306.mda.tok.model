while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same collection history that has occurred in the past 
the general payment terms are net days for domestic customers and net days for foreign customers 
a small percentage of the accounts receivable balance are denominated in a foreign currency with no concentration in any given country

micro machining is also in the process of being qualified for production by three major aerospace companies 
although the sales cycle with these customers is long  once specified as a process or component  the life of the business can be very long term 
the recognition by the industry of the company s unique ability to machine composite materials is coinciding with increasing demand for composite materials by the aerospace industry
