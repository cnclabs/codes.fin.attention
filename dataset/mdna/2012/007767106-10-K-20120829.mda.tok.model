we were founded in and have proprietary technology that is based on extensive know how and a long history of research and development focused on specialized technologies  often in collaboration with our customers 
the ipo transactions amendment to senior secured credit agreement on november   we amended our then existing senior secured credit facility  for which we paid a million fee to the lenders which was recorded as deferred financing costs and  of other costs that were expensed as incurred  which allowed us to  among other things increase the amount of cash we could spend for acquisitions of businesses  pay certain fees to affiliates of our sponsors upon the completion of our ipo 
these fees were paid on november   and consisted of a million transaction fee which was paid to affiliates of the sponsors under the advisory agreement with them for services directly attributable to the ipo transaction fee  which was recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital  and a million termination fee  to terminate the sponsor advisory agreement with them termination fee 
the termination fee  when combined with the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  amounted to an million expense which is reported in the statement of operations as termination of sponsor advisory agreement  and change the basis for calculating our interest rate margin above libor 
ipo in november  we consummated an ipo of our common stock in which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of million from the ipo  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  including the aforementioned million transaction fee 
in connection with the ipo  we repurchased an aggregate of million of our then existing senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans and paid million of tender premiums and expenses related thereto  paid a million termination fee to affiliates of the sponsors to terminate the advisory agreement with them  which  including the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  resulted in an million expense  and amended our then existing senior secured credit facility  for which a million fee was paid to the lenders 
debt repurchase in december  we repurchased million of our then existing senior unsecured notes and million of our then existing senior subordinated unsecured term loans with the net proceeds of our ipo 
this resulted in a million loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs  which was comprised of the following an premium paid on the debt repurchased  which amounted to million  the write off of the related deferred financing costs of million  and professional fees of  debt transactions debt refinancing on may   we entered into a new senior secured credit facility with various lenders  consisting of a senior secured term loan facility of million and a senior secured revolving credit facility of million  to refinance million of our then outstanding debt 
the new term loan facility provided for million quarterly principal repayments commencing september   with the remaining balance due at maturity on may  unless terminated earlier  the new revolving credit facility will expire on may  no amounts have been drawn under the revolving credit facility 
the outstanding borrowings under this senior secured credit facility bore interest  prior to the amendment  payable quarterly  at a rate per annum equal to either i the base rate as defined in the new secured credit facility  plus an applicable margin of basis points  or ii the adjusted libor rate  which has a floor of basis points as defined in the new senior secured credit facility  plus an applicable margin of basis points 
the million proceeds were used to refinance million of our then outstanding debt  as follows to repay the entire outstanding balance of million under our then existing senior secured credit facility  to repurchase all of our unsecured senior notes of million  and to prepay all of our senior subordinated unsecured term loans of million 
to pay a portion of the fees and expenses totaling million in connection with the refinancing 
debt amendment on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility  for which we paid a million fee to the lenders which was recorded as deferred financing costs and  of other costs that were expensed as incurred  which allowed us to increase the flexibility under the total leverage ratio covenant 
as a result of the amendment  the applicable libor interest margin increased from basis points to basis points 
factors and trends that affect our business in reading our consolidated financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our results 
revenue there are many factors that impact our sales 
some are outside of our direct control  such as changes in government spending on space  avionics and defense  the buying patterns of our customers  the uptake of new technologies  exchange rate fluctuations or general economic conditions 
for those factors outside of our direct control  we attempt to respond quickly to changes to minimize the risk of adverse consequences 
other factors are within our control  such as our pricing strategies and our product development focus 
we constantly reassess our markets and evaluate potential new end markets for our technologies 
due to our many years of experience in our markets  we often are part of our customers fundamental design strategies  which gives us greater visibility into potential new products and market demand 
we often design and develop platform specific and customized products for our customers 
our major customers often use our products in multiple systems or programs  sometimes developed by different business units within the customer s organization 
although our product offerings and customer base are broad and diverse  sales derived from our ten largest customers as a percentage of our net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal while the composition of our top ten customers varies from year to year  we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
no single customer exceeded of our net revenue in fiscal  or approximately of our sales in fiscal  of our sales for fiscal and of our sales for fiscal were to agencies of the united states government or to prime defense contractors or subcontractors of the united states government 
gross margin our gross margin in any period is significantly affected by product mix  that is  the percentage of our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or lower margin products and to a lesser extent  by pricing 
the impact of product mix is evident in both the fiscal and improvements experienced in our consolidated gross margin as the gross margins for wireless test equipment products and integrated circuits  which had increased sales in both fiscal and  are higher than the consolidated average gross margins 
likewise  the impact of product mix is evident in fiscal as decreased sales of wireless test products were the principal cause of the reduction in our consolidated gross margin 
additional factors affecting our gross margins include changes in the costs of materials and labor  changes in cost estimates for contracts for which revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis  variations in overhead absorption rates and other manufacturing efficiencies  and numerous other factors 
to continue to improve our gross margins  we seek to introduce products that are valued by our customers for the ability of those products to address technically challenging applications where performance and reliability are the highest priorities 
we also seek continuously to reduce our costs and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  such as with the restructuring activities we have taken during the last several years 
selling  general administrative costs our selling  general and administrative costs consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative overhead costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales have historically been modest as we have continually focused on controlling our costs 
on a gaap basis  our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales have increased from to over the last three fiscal years  due mainly to a reduction in sales 
to help reduce the adverse impact on profitability resulting from the worldwide economic downturn that began to affect our business in  we froze salaries at the beginning of fiscal at their fiscal levels and suspended the match to our k plan 
based upon our performance in fiscal  we reinstated the match to our k plan  albeit at a reduced level  and resumed salary increases in fiscal in response to our recent downturn in sales  we again froze salaries and suspended the match to our k plan in fiscal additionally  headcount reductions were carried out in both ams and ats to reduce costs in response to market conditions 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs related to direct product design  development and process engineering 
the level of research and development expense is related to the number of products in development  the state of the development process  the complexity of the underlying technology  the potential scale of the product upon successful commercialization  the level of our exploratory research and the extent to which product development and similar costs are recoverable under contractual arrangements 
we generally conduct such activities in collaboration with our customers  which provide better visibility into areas we believe will accelerate our longer term sales growth 
our basic technologies have been developed through a combination of internal development  acquisitions of businesses with technologies in similar or adjacent fields and  more recently  through licenses 
our recent acquisitions have been more of a tuck in nature  demonstrative of a business philosophy that is not hesitant to acquire a business when it is more cost efficient to buy technology than to develop it 
licenses have primarily been used to access technology geared to a commercial application that we can translate to a radiation hardened application for use in space 
on a consolidated basis  our research and development costs were million for the fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  acquisitions and restructurings during the three year period covered by the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we made the following acquisitions date acquisition description may willtek communications wireless test equipment june radiation assured devices radiation tolerant testing  screening and high reliability radiation tolerant components semiconductors august advanced control components rf and microwave components and assemblies in august  we were ourselves acquired and taken private 
the application of purchase accounting is  therefore  pervasive throughout our consolidated financial statements  most notably in the balance sheets amortizable and non amortizable intangible asset accounts and in the operating statements amortization of intangibles 
acquired businesses often require restructuring activities to better align their on going operations with those of our company and to improve their profitability 
the majority of the restructuring charges contained in our consolidated financial statements relate to activities taken to consolidate our acquired european manufacturing operations and consolidate certain of our acquired us components facilities 
for instance in the aeroflex microelectronic solutions ams segment  we implemented a plan in to move the resistor product line from our whippany  new jersey factory to our operations in ann arbor  michigan 
additionally  in fiscal we implemented a plan to move the integrated product line in our whippany factory to our then recently acquired facility in eatontown  new jersey 
these actions  which were completed in fiscal  better aligned our manufacturing operations and enabled us to close our whippany factory 
in the aeroflex test solutions ats segment  we reorganized and integrated willtek a company we acquired in may into our existing uk operations 
these activities began with the elimination of redundant personnel in fiscal and were completed in fiscal when willtek s manufacturing was moved from germany to our uk manufacturing facility 
additionally  in response to substantially lower than expected sales in fiscal  we reduced ats headcount by people including people in europe within our wireless test business 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of severance costs of million  facility closure costs of million and other non cash charges of million  primarily related to the continued integration of willtek into our european operations and the continued consolidation of one of our domestic components facilities located in whippany  new jersey into two of our other facilities 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of i severance costs of million and facility closure costs of million  primarily related to the integration of willtek into our european operations and the continued consolidation of one of our domestic components facilities located in whippany  new jersey into two of our other facilities  and ii a non cash building impairment charge of million  based on the fair value of the whippany  new jersey facility we intend to sell 
for the fiscal year ended june   restructuring charges consisted of severance costs of  offset by a reduction of  of facility closure costs previously accrued  related to continued consolidation and reorganization efforts in our european operations and the consolidation of one of our domestic components facilities located in whippany  new jersey into two of our other facilities 
interest expense in connection with the going private transaction  we incurred million of debt to finance the acquisition of aeroflex 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in december  we used the majority of the net proceeds from our ipo to repurchase an aggregate of million of our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans 
in may  we borrowed million  under the senior secured term loan of our new senior secured credit facility at the adjusted libor  which has a floor of  plus a margin of prior to amendment as described below  and repaid million of our then existing debt  including million of debt bearing interest at per annum 
on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility  which allowed us to increase the flexibility under the total leverage ratio covenant 
as a result of the amendment  the applicable libor interest margin increased from basis points to basis points 
these transactions  as well as the amount of debt repayments made in the normal course of business over the last few years  including approximately million of prepayments in fiscal  have significantly reduced the amount of debt outstanding to million at june  as discussed above  the rates at which we borrow have also changed as a result of the aforementioned transactions 
as a result  interest expense amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes as a multi national company  we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
as earnings from our foreign operations are repatriated to the us  we are subject to us income taxes on those amounts 
our tax provision may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to changes in jurisdictions where income is earned 
in addition  our tax provision may be impacted by an enacted change in tax rates and or availability of tax credits and incentives 
results of operations the following table sets forth our historical results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated below year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative costs research and development costs amortization of acquired intangibles termination of sponsor advisory agreement restructuring charges impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration liability loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiary total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs gain from a bargain purchase of a business other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss statements of operations management evaluates the operating results of our two segments based upon adjusted operating income  which is pre tax operating income before certain non cash  non recurring and other items

the comparative fiscal amount of million was a record 
the decrease was due in large part to the marketplace difficulties encountered by ats wireless test business 
to a lesser extent  the changes in us government related purchasing patterns have also negatively impacted our business this year 
our backlog was million at june  compared to million at june  we continued to feel the impact of the economic crisis in europe and conservative capital spending in asia geographies where the majority of our wireless test customers are located 
additionally  the rollout of the next generation wireless protocol  lte long term evolution  has been significantly slower than we initially anticipated 
we have maintained our strong position in the infrastructure market and continue to invest in our technology and customer relationships 
during the pause in this market  we have taken actions to combine certain operations and to right size others  and will be taking additional measures to make our operations more efficient 
for instance  we implemented a wage freeze and suspended the match to our k plan during fiscal we also initiated other cost saving measures by reducing personnel at various locations worldwide 
the headcount reductions were most notable in the uk  where our wireless test business is headquartered 
on a consolidated basis  headcount was reduced people 
ats implemented headcount reductions of and ams implemented headcount reductions of the ats reduction of included in europe contractors and employees 
additionally  in july  ats s wireless business implemented additional headcount reductions of employees and took further steps to right size its business 
the actions taken during fiscal and to be implemented in fiscal are expected to produce cost savings of approximately million 
due to the timing of those actions  approximately million of cost savings were achieved in fiscal the realization of the remaining cost savings in fiscal may be mitigated by a number of factors  such as to what extent i salary increases are given  ii the match to our k plan is reinstated  iii bonuses are achieved  and other costs subject to normal inflationary increases 
we have an experienced senior management team that has a demonstrated history of taking the actions necessary to manage our company through difficult business climates  such as those experienced in the early s when reductions took place in the levels of defense spending 
the actions taken in fiscal will enable us to more efficiently navigate the current business environment and are expected to return aeroflex to better profitability 
net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to a decline in the ats segment 
net sales of of fiscal year consolidated consolidated ended june  ams net sales ats net sales total net sales in the ams segment decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this sales decrease was primarily attributable to volume driven reductions in i sales of rf and microwave components primarily related to what we believe is a slowdown in the telecom broadband market  ii sales of hirel microelectronics semiconductors primarily due to program delays  combined with government budgetary constraints on defense and space programs  and iii sales of motion control products primarily due to a delay in funding which pushed back sales for various programs 
these reductions were offset by volume driven increases  the most significant of which was million of mixed signal digital application specific integrated circuits asics 
net sales in the ats segment decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was attributable to a million reduction in sales of wireless test equipment and a million reduction in sales of general purpose test equipment  primarily due to capital equipment freezes put in place by our customers in the latter part of calendar year coincident with a slower than anticipated roll out of g lte technology  particularly at certain of our larger handset customers and  to a lesser extent  pricing pressure 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by an increase in sales of radio test sets of million  which primarily relates to shipments of our grmats product 
gross profit 
gross profit equals net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes materials  direct labor  amortization of capitalized software development costs and overhead expenses such as engineering labor  fringe benefits  depreciation  allocable occupancy costs and manufacturing supplies 
on a consolidated basis  gross profit was million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million  or of net sales  for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit fiscal year of of of ended net net net june  ams sales ats sales total sales gross margins in the ams segment were for the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit decreased million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in gross margin is principally attributable to product mix and decreased sales of hirel microelectronics semiconductors which carry margins greater than the ams segment average 
gross margins in the ats segment were for the fiscal year ended june  and for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit decreased million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in gross margin was caused primarily by the reduction in wireless sales  which carry margins greater than the ats segment average  and the increased sales of the grmats products in the fiscal year ended june  which were sold at margins below the ats segment average 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs include office and management salaries  fringe benefits  commissions  insurance and professional fees 
on a consolidated basis  sg a costs were relatively flat when comparing fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of sales  however  sg a costs increased from to from the fiscal year ended june  to the fiscal year ended june   due to the million unanticipated reduction in sales 
on a percentage basis to sales  sg a costs increased in both the ams and ats segments as most of our costs are fixed in the short term 
as discussed above  actions have been taken to respond to the fiscal decline in sales 
concerning sg a  the impact of the salary freeze and suspension of the k match initiated at the beginning of fiscal  combined with the savings realized from the aforementioned headcount reductions  lower sales commissions and bonuses served to control and reduce costs by approximately million  however  the savings were offset by a number of items  most notably i a million increase in medical costs  ii a million increase in litigation and settlement costs related to several litigation matters  and iii a million increase in non cash compensation related to equity awards under the company s equity plan 
the majority of the previously discussed headcount reductions were initiated during the second half of fiscal when the manufacturing operations by an acquired wireless business willtek were integrated into our existing uk wireless manufacturing facility 
in july  our ats wireless business made further headcount reductions and took additional steps to right size its business 
selling  general and administrative costs fiscal year of of of ended net net net june  ams sales ats sales corporate total sales research and development costs 
research and development costs include materials  engineering labor and allocated overhead

research and development costs fiscal year of of of ended net net net june  ams sales ats sales total sales termination of sponsor advisory agreement 
in connection with the ipo  we paid a million fee to affiliates of the sponsors on november  to terminate the advisory agreement with them and eliminate all future payments to the sponsors under that agreement which  including the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  resulted in an million expense in the fiscal year ended june  there was no similar charge recorded for the fiscal year ended june  restructuring charges 
on a consolidated basis  restructuring charges were million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the ams segment incurred total restructuring costs of million for the fiscal year ended june  in comparison  in the fiscal year ended june   the ams segment incurred total restructuring costs of million 
in both periods  the costs related primarily to the consolidation of our components operations by relocating a portion of our whippany  new jersey facility s production to our ann arbor  michigan facility and a portion to our eatontown  new jersey facility 
in connection with this consolidation  in the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a million impairment charge based on the fair value of the whippany  new jersey facility we intend to sell 
the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily related to cost savings initiatives which resulted in reductions in personnel at various locations worldwide  most notably in connection with integration of willtek s manufacturing operations in germany into our uk facility 
in comparison  for the fiscal year ended june   the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of million  primarily related to the reduction of willtek s workforce in germany 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
in fiscal  due to a decline in ams s rfmw reporting unit s forecasted operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal and beyond  we recorded non cash impairment charges to goodwill and other long lived assets related to the rfmw reporting unit of million and million  respectively 
there were no similar impairment charges recorded in the fiscal year ended june  change in fair value of acquisition contingent liability 
in the fiscal year ended june  we recognized a net benefit of million related to the decrease in fair value of the acquisition contingent consideration liability due to the former owners of rad  acquired in june  due to slower than anticipated roll out of new products  which has changed the future projection of sales during the earn out period 
in the fiscal year ended june  we recognized an expense of million  primarily related to an increase in the contingent consideration liability 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense decreased as a result of the repurchase  in december  of million of our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans with the proceeds from our ipo  the refinancing in may of the then outstanding amounts due under the prior secured credit facility  senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loan with borrowings under a new senior secured credit facility at lower aggregate interest rates and repayments of million of our term loan and other debt in fiscal we expect the full impact to interest expense of the debt amendment completed in may will be reflected in fiscal when  based on current rates and giving effect to the million repaid in august interest expense will amount to approximately million in fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs 
during the fiscal year ended june  we incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs  which was comprised primarily of million in tender premiums paid on the debt repurchased and million for the write off of the related deferred financing costs 
during the fiscal year ended june   we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of million of debt 
gain from a bargain purchase of a business 
during the fiscal year ended june  we recognized a  gain on the willtek bargain purchase  acquired in june  related to the final working capital adjustment to the purchase price 
other income expense 
other income expense of million for the fiscal year ended june  consisted of  of foreign currency transaction losses and  of miscellaneous expense  net 
other income expense of  for the fiscal year ended june  consisted of a  other than temporary impairment recorded on our auction rate securities and  of foreign currency transactions losses offset by  of interest income and miscellaneous income  net 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit was million for the fiscal year ended june  on a pre tax loss of million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the reported tax benefit was less than anticipated due to a goodwill and intangible impairment charge of million in the us that was mostly non deductible 
another significant item impacting the effective tax rate for fiscal was the benefit from the reversal of the contingent consideration of million that was not taxable 
we recorded an income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  of million on a pre tax loss of million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in fiscal  we had a pre tax loss in the us and taxable income from foreign operations 
the us loss was primarily due to expenses associated with our debt interest expense  loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs and for the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement 
the effective tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes  including us income tax on certain foreign net income that we anticipate will be repatriated to the u 
s  the r d credit and non deductible and other non taxable items 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
based on the significant balance of deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets that are scheduled to reverse over the next several years  we did not record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated in fiscal with respect to our us net operating loss carryforwards 
although the company has a history of domestic pre tax losses in recent years  these losses are largely driven by amortization expense recorded in the financial statements relating to the us operations which are not deductible for us income tax purposes 
the amount of non deductible us book amortization expense recorded in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the company incurred unusual charges of million in connection with the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement and million in connection with the refinancing of its debt that resulted in a taxable loss for which a deferred tax asset was recorded for the net operating loss carryforwards 
the domestic loss reported in fiscal was largely the result of an impairment charge of million  of which million is non deductible 
in addition  the company repatriated million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary during the year for which us tax was previously provided 
the combination of non deductible amortization expense  the non deductible impairment charge and repatriated earnings resulted in the company generating sufficient us taxable income in to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforward from at june   we had provided us deferred taxes of million on the accumulated earnings of one foreign subsidiary based on the company s intent to repatriate these earnings 
part of these earnings were repatriated to the us during fiscal which was used to pay down principal on the company s outstanding debt 
during fiscal  we also provided us deferred taxes of million on the accumulated earnings of this subsidiary and two additional foreign subsidiaries for which the company intends to repatriate the earnings in the foreseeable future 
at june   the company has approximately million of us deferred taxes provided for the expectation of the repatriation of these earnings 
aside from these three subsidiaries  the company does not have any significant overseas earnings for which us taxes have not been provided 
during the three months ended september   we identified an overstatement of deferred income tax liabilities established in the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal related to us income taxes provided on unremitted foreign earnings 
after consideration of both the quantitative and qualitative factors  we determined the amounts were not material to any of those prior period financial statements or the fiscal estimated results and thus corrected the balance in the three months ended september  the adjustment resulted in a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities of million  with a corresponding increase in income tax benefit in the statement of operations for the three months ended september  the adjustment did not impact the statement of cash flows 
in the fiscal years ended june  and  we paid income taxes of million and million and received refunds of  and million  respectively related to federal  state and foreign income taxes

termination of sponsor advisory agreement 
in connection with the ipo  we paid a million termination fee to affiliates of the sponsors on november  to terminate the sponsor advisory agreement with them and eliminate all future payments to the sponsors under that agreement  which  including the related write off of prepaid advisory fees  resulted in an million expense 
there was no similar charge recorded for the fiscal year ended june  restructuring charges 
on a consolidated basis  restructuring charges were million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the ams segment incurred total restructuring costs of million for the fiscal year ended june  in comparison  in the fiscal year ended june   the ams segment incurred total restructuring costs of  in both periods  the costs related primarily to consolidation of our components operations by relocating a portion of our whippany  new jersey facility s production to our ann arbor  michigan facility and a portion to our eatontown  new jersey facility 
in connection with this consolidation  during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a million building impairment charge based on the fair value of the whippany  new jersey facility we intend to sell 
the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of million for the fiscal year ended june  in comparison  for the fiscal year ended june   the ats segment incurred restructuring costs of  in both periods  the costs related primarily to consolidation and reorganization efforts in our european operations with the increase in the fiscal year ended june  due to the integration of willtek 
change in fair value of acquisition contingent liability 
in the fiscal year ended june  we recognized an expense of million  related to the contingent earnout of the former shareholders of rad 
loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiary 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a million non cash loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 
there was no similar charge recorded for the fiscal year ended june  other income expense 
interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense decreased as a result of the repurchase  in december  of million of our senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans with the proceeds from the ipo and the refinancing in may of the then outstanding amounts due under the prior secured credit facility  senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loan with borrowings under a new senior secured credit facility at lower aggregate interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended june  we incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs  which was comprised primarily of million in tender premiums paid on the debt repurchased and million for the write off of the related deferred financing costs 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a million gain from a bargain purchase of the assets of willtek communications  acquired may the gain from a bargain purchase of willtek reflects the excess of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired less the liabilities assumed over the purchase price 
the purchase price was negotiated at such a level to be reflective of the cost of the restructuring efforts 
during the fiscal year ended june  we recognized an additional  gain on the willtek bargain purchase  related to the final working capital adjustment to the purchase price 
other income expense of  for the fiscal year ended june  consisted primarily of a  realized loss recorded on our auction rate securities and  of foreign currency transaction losses  partially offset by  of interest and miscellaneous income 
other income expense of  for the fiscal year ended june  consisted primarily of million of interest and miscellaneous income  partially offset by  of foreign currency transaction losses 
income taxes 
for fiscal  we had a pre tax loss in the us and taxable income from foreign operations 
the us loss was primarily due to expenses associated with our debt interest expense  loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs and for the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement 
we recorded an overall income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended june  on a pre tax loss of million  resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
we recorded an income tax provision for the fiscal year ended june  of  on a pre tax loss of million  resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the provisions were a combination of us tax benefits on domestic losses and foreign tax expense on foreign earnings 
the effective income tax rate for both periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to foreign  state and local income taxes  including us income tax on certain foreign net income that we anticipated would be repatriated to the us  the r d credit and non deductible items 
as a direct result of our ipo  and related repurchase of a portion of our debt in december  interest payments have decreased 
consequently  in the quarter ended december   we changed our intent as to the amount and method of repatriations of foreign earnings  which resulted in a million reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to us income taxes previously provided on unremitted foreign earnings 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  also reflects other discrete items  including an  income tax benefit for the retroactive reinstatement of the us r d credit and a reduction of  of net deferred tax liabilities due to a reduction in the united kingdom income tax rate 
at june   we had provided us deferred income taxes of million on the accumulated earnings of one foreign subsidiary which we intended to repatriate to the us during the three months ended september   we identified an overstatement of deferred income tax liabilities established in the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal related to us income taxes provided on unremitted foreign earnings 
after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors  we determined the amounts were not material to any of those prior period financial statements or the fiscal estimated results and thus corrected the balance in the three months ended september  the adjustment resulted in a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities of million  with a corresponding increase in income tax benefit in the statement of operations for the three months ended september  the adjustment did not impact the statement of cash flows and was not material to fiscal results 
the tax provision for the fiscal year ended june  was affected by the unfavorable impact of a million nondeductible loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary  and the favorable impact of a million loss for tax purposes on the write off of our investment in a foreign subsidiary in fiscal for financial statement purposes  the loss had been recognized in the prior periods  however  for tax purposes the loss was recognized at the time of divestiture  effective september the fiscal year ended june  provision also included us income taxes on a substantial portion of our foreign earnings that were to be repatriated to the us to partially fund interest and principal payments on our debt 
the impact of the above mentioned items significantly increased the effective income tax rate for fiscal in the fiscal year ended june  we paid income taxes of million and received tax refunds of million related to federal  state and foreign income taxes 
in the fiscal year ended june   we paid income taxes of million and received refunds of net loss 
our net loss was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the million unfavorable increase in net loss is comprised of the following a loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs of million in connection with the debt repurchase in december and debt refinancing in may  an increase in operating expenses of million  primarily due to increased sg a costs  r d spending and restructuring expenses  an expense related to the termination of the sponsor advisory agreement of million in connection with the ipo in november  and an unfavorable variance of a gain from a bargain purchase of the assets of willtek of million  partially offset by an increase of million in gross profit  primarily due to increased sales and increased margins  a decrease in the income tax provision of million  a favorable variance in other income expense of million  primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of million as a result of the debt repurchase in december and the debt refinancing in may  and a non cash loss on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and our current ratio was to  versus million  million and to  respectively  at june  our principal liquidity requirements are to service our debt and interest and meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
during fiscal  we repaid million of our senior secured term loan facility  including voluntary prepayments of million  with cash on hand at june  and cash generated from operations during fiscal that included significant reductions in accounts receivable and inventory 
the voluntary prepayments resulted in the write off of the related deferred financing costs of million 
these voluntary prepayments were first applied to the scheduled quarterly repayments beginning with the march  payment  and second  to the amount due at the end of the term of the loan 
therefore  we will not have any further required quarterly repayments and will be required to pay million on may  on may   we amended our senior secured credit facility  for which we paid a million fee to the lenders which was recorded as deferred financing costs and  of other costs that were expensed as incurred  which allowed us to increase the flexibility under the total leverage ratio covenant 
additionally  at june   we were able to borrow million under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility  of which none was outstanding 
as of june   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our debt agreement 
certain loan covenants are based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda net income loss before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to add back or subtract certain non cash  non recurring and other items  as required by various covenants in our debt agreement 
our use of the term adjusted ebitda may vary from others in our industry 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of operating income loss  performance or liquidity under us gaap and are subject to important limitations 
a reconciliation of net income loss  which is a us gaap measure of our operating results  to adjusted ebitda  as defined in our debt agreement  is as follows year ended june  in thousands unaudited net income loss    interest expense    provision benefit for income taxes   depreciation and amortization    ebitda    non cash purchase accounting adjustments  change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration liability   merger related expenses   restructuring costs and related pro forma savings a  share based compensation    termination of sponsor advisory agreement  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  loss on liquidation of foreign subsidiary  loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs   gain from a bargain purchase of a business other defined items b    adjusted ebitda    a primarily reflects costs associated with the reorganization of our european operations and consolidation of certain of our us component facilities 
pro forma savings reflect the costs that we estimate would have been eliminated during the fiscal year in which a restructuring occurred had the restructuring occurred as of the first day of that fiscal year 
pro forma savings were estimated to be million for the year ended june  b reflects other adjustments required in calculating our debt covenant compliance 
these other defined items include legal fees related to litigation  business acquisition costs and pro forma ebitda for periods prior to the acquisition dates for companies acquired during our fiscal year 
financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility include a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less up to million of unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda  as defined in our senior secured credit facility 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted for the fiscal year ended june  was  whereas our actual leverage ratio was 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted periodically decreases as follows effective as of maximum the twelve months permitted ending leverage ratio march  september  march  june  september  december  march  we believe we will continue to be in compliance with the leverage ratio for the fiscal year ending june  our senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on our activities  including but not limited to covenants that restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries  as defined in our senior secured credit facility  from incurring additional indebtedness and issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock  making certain investments or other restricted payments  paying dividends and making other distributions with respect to capital stock  or repurchasing  redeeming or retiring capital stock or subordinated debt  selling or otherwise disposing of assets  under certain circumstances  issuing or selling equity interests  creating liens on our assets  consolidating or merging with  or acquiring in excess of specified annual limitations  another business  or selling or disposing of all or substantially all of our assets  and entering into certain transactions with our affiliates 
if for any reason we fail to comply with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility  we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding debt 
if such a default were to occur  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable  and the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds to us 
if the amounts outstanding under these debt agreements are accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed 
we expect that cash generated from operating activities and availability under the revolving portion of our new senior secured credit facility will be our principal sources of liquidity 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  to the extent we have consolidated excess cash flows  as defined in the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facility  we must use specified portions of the excess cash flows to prepay the senior secured credit facility 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or those future borrowings will be available under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness at maturity or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
cash flows for fiscal  our cash flow provided by operations was million  which included cash generated by reductions in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million due to concerted efforts made to better manage these items in fiscal our investing activities used cash of million  primarily for capital expenditures of million and earn out payments of million related to acquired businesses 
our financing activities used cash of million  primarily for debt repayments of million that included million of voluntary prepayments 
for fiscal  our cash flow used by operations was million  which included cash used to increase inventory by million in support of higher sales  to address longer lead times from suppliers and to reduce product delivery times to customers 
our investing activities used cash of million  primarily for payments for the purchase of businesses of million and for capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million 
our financing activities provided cash of million million of proceeds from term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and million from the ipo of our common stock  partially offset by the repurchase of senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured term loans  including premiums and fees  of million  debt repayments of million and debt financing costs of million 
for fiscal  our cash flow provided by operations was million 
our investing activities used cash of million  primarily for payments for the purchase of businesses of million  net of cash acquired  and for capital expenditures of million 
these investing activities were offset by million received from the redemption of auction rate securities 
our financing activities used cash of million to repay indebtedness 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily consist of equipment replacements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and other obligations as of june  payments due by period in millions beyond total year years years years senior secured credit facility interest payments operating leases employment agreements total we do not expect any future minimum sub lease rentals associated with operating lease commitments shown in the above table 
as of june  we were unable to reliably estimate when cash settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities may occur with our unrecognized tax benefits of million  therefore  such amounts are not included in the table above 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
we do not expect that these commitments  as of june   will have a material adverse affect on our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have material current or future effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap 
we consolidate our subsidiaries  all of which  except for test evolution corporation  are wholly owned 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires that management of the company make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the more significant estimates included in our consolidated financial statements are revenue and cost recognition under long term contracts  the valuation of accounts receivable  inventories  investments and deferred tax assets  the depreciable lives of fixed assets and useful lives of amortizable intangible assets  the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  the recoverability of long lived amortizable intangible assets  tradenames and goodwill  share based compensation  restructuring charges  asset retirement obligations  fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities and certain accrued expenses and contingencies 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in the business climate  therefore  actual results may differ from those estimates 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other when estimating contingent liabilities  the low end of the range is accrued 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant them 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of trade discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred or the services have been performed  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of microelectronic products and test and measurement equipment 
for arrangements other than certain long term contracts  revenue including shipping and handling fees is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer 
if title does not pass until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  recognition of the revenue is deferred until that time 
certain of our sales are to distributors  which have a right to return some portion of product within specified periods from delivery 
we generally recognize revenue on these sales at the time of shipment to the distributor  as the returns under these arrangements have historically been insignificant and can be reasonably estimated 
a provision for such estimated returns is recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
for transactions that include customer specified acceptance criteria  including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
long term contracts are accounted for by determining estimated contract profit rates and use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenues and associated costs as work progresses 
we measure the extent of progress toward completion generally based upon one of the following methods based upon an assessment of which method most closely aligns to the underlying earnings process i the units of delivery method  ii the cost to cost method using the ratio of contract costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs at contract completion based upon engineering and production estimates  or iii the achievement of contractual milestones 
provisions for anticipated losses or revisions in estimated profits on contracts in process are recorded in the period in which such anticipated losses or revisions become evident 
where an arrangement includes only a software license  revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title has been transferred to the customer or  in the case of electronic delivery of software  when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs 
we also evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection of the receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist for which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element 
when a customer purchases software together with post contract support  we allocate a portion of the fee to the post contract support for its fair value based on the contractual renewal rate 
post contract support fees are deferred in advance payments by customers and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets  and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
service revenue is derived from extended warranty  customer support and training 
service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual term or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
for example  revenue from customer support contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual term  while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer 
in addition  the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  verifiable objective evidence of selling price  such as third party selling prices  or estimated selling price  in that order  to allocate non software revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements 
revenue is recognized on only those elements that meet the four criteria described above 
advance payments by customers and deferred revenue was comprised of i advance payments by customers primarily for the purchase of materials  ii deferred service and software support revenue  iii deferred warranty revenue and iv deferred revenue related to multiple deliverable arrangements 
we generally sell non software service and extended warranty contracts on a standalone basis 
acquisition accounting we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations  whereby the total purchase price of an acquisition  including contingent consideration  is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
a gain is recorded if the purchase price is less than the fair value of net assets and liabilities 
the allocation of the purchase price is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies  which contain estimates and assumptions 
effective with acquisitions consummated after june   costs related to our acquisitions are expensed as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of tradenames 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
we assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available that segment management regularly reviews to assess operating results 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i we determine if there is an impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its net identifiable assets with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
as of june   plainview ats had goodwill of million and an enterprise carrying value of million 
we determined if there was an impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its enterprise carrying value 
based on our current analysis of the discounted estimated cash flows of this unit  we have estimated that the fair value of this unit was approximately million at june  and that the goodwill has not been impaired 
however  should actual results differ from our forecasts of cash flows and our estimated enterprise fair value decreases below the carrying value  then an impairment may occur and we would need to calculate the amount of the write down of goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its net identifiable assets with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and assumptions 
the assumptions made will impact the outcome and ultimate results of the testing 
we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and  in certain instances  we engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in estimating fair values 
to determine fair value of the reporting unit  we use an income approach 
we use a market approach to assess the reasonableness of the results of the income approach 
under the income approach  we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow method  estimating future cash flows of each reporting unit  as well as terminal value  and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows 
the key estimates and factors used in the income approach include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates and profit margins based on historical results and internal forecasts  terminal value and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the compound annual growth rate of sales for the first years of our projections ranged between and as of june  the compound annual growth rate of sales for the first to years of our projections ranged between and as of june  the terminal growth rates were projected at after years as of june  as compared to after to years as of june   which reflects our estimate of long term market and gross domestic product growth 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows ranged from to as of june  and future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill 
changes in the valuation assumptions from those used in the prior year primarily reflect the impact of the current economic environment  including our stock performance on the reporting units and their projected future results of operations 
the impairment test for other intangible assets with indefinite lives encompasses determining a fair value and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is recorded 
to determine the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we use an income approach  the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset 
the fair value other intangible assets with indefinite lives require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
long lived assets we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value  which is determined by discounting future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of plant and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  on a straight line basis 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease  including anticipated renewals  or the estimated life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization 
where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against such asset 
the company has adopted the provisions of asc formerly fin and records uncertain tax position liabilities for federal  state  local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the calculation of these tax liabilities require judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and are a subjective critical estimate 
the company classifies interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes 
share based compensation the fair value of share based payments is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting periods 
share based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest and has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of the grant  with subsequent revisions for the differences between actual and the estimated forfeiture rates see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its authoritative guidance related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing their indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing further impairment testing 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  a quantitative test is required 
this new guidance will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this new guidance will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance also requires entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
this new guidance will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal and is to be applied retrospectively 
we have not yet determined which presentation method we will adopt 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
we currently do not have interest rate swap agreements hedging this debt 
as of june   there was million outstanding at adjusted libor plus under the term loan portion of the senior secured credit facility  all of which is subject to variable interest rates 
the adjusted libor  as defined in the senior secured credit facility  has a floor of on the term loan 
based on libor at june   an increase of in interest rates would result in a increase  due to the floor  or a million increase in our annual interest expense 
any increase in interest rates above the floor would result in a million increase in our annual interest expense 
a change in interest rates would result in a  change in our annual interest expense on the revolving loan borrowings  assuming the entire million was outstanding 
any debt we incur in the future may also bear interest at floating rates 
foreign currency risk 
foreign currency contracts are used to protect us from exchange rate fluctuation from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until such currency is exchanged for us dollars 
we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts  which are not designated as hedges  and the change in the fair value is included in income currently within other income expense 
as of june   we had million of notional value foreign currency forward contracts maturing through july  notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts 
the fair value of these contracts at june  was an asset of  if foreign currency exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro change by from the levels at june   the effect on our comprehensive income would be approximately million 
inflation risk 
inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition during the preceding three years
