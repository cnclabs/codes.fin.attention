overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and securities  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges fees and commissions  which include service charges on deposit accounts  brokerage fee income and other loan fees including loan brokerage fees and late charges  income from bank owned life insurance and income from loan sales and servicing 
in addition  we recognize income or losses from the sale of securities available for sale in years that we have such sales 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to cover the inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
expenses 
the non interest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  data processing expenses and various other miscellaneous expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for loan losses requires the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the probable loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
qualitative factors  or risks considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for all loan classes include historical loss experience  levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  impaired loans and net charge offs  the character and size of the loan portfolio  effects of any changes in underwriting policies  experience of management and staff  current economic conditions and their effect on borrowers  effects of changes in credit concentrations  and management s estimation of probable losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard  or special mention 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
loans considered for impairment include all loan classes of commercial and residential  as well as home equity loans 
the classes are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment evaluation  except for home equity loans 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  our banking regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for mortgage servicing rights relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as a component of non interest expense 
other than temporary impairment 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain benefits  and noncurrent marketable equity securities  require companies to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
a review of other than temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline  its effect on the financial statements and the probability  extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company s intent and ability to hold the security 
pursuant to these requirements  we assess valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial condition  business prospects or other factors or market related factors  such as interest rates or equity market declines 
declines in the fair value of securities below their costs that are deemed to be other than temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses 
for declines in the fair value of individual debt securities available for sale below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  where the company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the other than temporary decline in the fair value of the debt security related to credit loss is recognized in earnings and other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income or loss 
credit loss is determined to exist if the present value of expected future cash flows using the effective rate at acquisition is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
for individual debt securities where the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost  the other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the security s cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method 
operating strategy our mission is to operate and grow a profitable community oriented financial institution serving primarily retail customers and businesses in our market areas 
we plan to continue our strategy of increasing our commercial relationships in our expanding market area  increasing our deposit market share in our expanding market area  increasing our sale of non deposit investment products  improving operating efficiency and cost control  and applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio 
continuing to increase our commercial relationships in our expanding market area 
we have diversified our loan portfolio beyond residential loans by increasing our commercial relationships 
our commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial and industrial loan portfolio has increased million  or  from million  or of the total loan portfolio  at december  to million  or of the total loan portfolio  at december  business deposit accounts have increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  in order to support the growth in the commercial loan portfolio  we have also increased the number of commercial lenders and commercial lending administrative staff 
increasing our deposit market share in our expanding market area 
retail deposits are our primary source of funds for investing and lending 
by offering a variety of deposit products  special and tiered pricing  and superior customer service  we will seek to retain and expand existing customer relationships as well as attract new deposit customers 
personalized service and flexibility with regard to customer needs will continue to be augmented with a full array of delivery channels to maximize customer convenience 
these include drive up banking  atms  internet banking  automated bill payment  remote capture  and telephone banking 
through our continued focus on these deposit gathering efforts in existing branch locations  couple with our plans for geographic expansion  we expect to increase the overall level of deposits and our market share in the markets we serve 
in addition  historically  one of our primary competitors for retail deposits in the chicopee market area has been credit unions 
credit unions are formidable competitors since  as tax exempt organizations  they are able to offer higher rates on retail deposits than banks 
by expanding our market area beyond the immediate chicopee market area  and beyond the market areas of our larger credit union competitors  we intend to increase our overall deposit market share of hampden county 
increasing our sale of non deposit investment products 
our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in order to decrease our reliance on interest rate spread income we have pursued initiatives to increase non interest income 
we offer non deposit investment products  including mutual funds  annuities  pension plans  life insurance  long term care and college savings plans through a third party registered broker dealer  linsco private ledger 
this initiative generated   and  of non interest income during the years ended december    and  respectively 
in connection with our expanding branch network  we intend to continue to increase our sale of non deposit investment products by engaging one additional retail investment employee to serve customers of our anticipated branch expansion 
improving operating efficiency and cost control 
non interest expense increased  or  from million  or of average total assets  at december  to million  or of average total assets  at december  the increase in expenses was largely due to the increase in salaries and benefits of  or  and an increase in fdic insurance premium fees of  or 
in  despite the increase in non interest expense  we were able to decrease the non interest expense ratio as a percentage of average assets from at december  to at december  due to the increase in average assets 
we recognize that our growth strategies have required greater investments in personnel  marketing  premises and equipment which have had a negative impact on our expense ratio over the short term 
our non interest expenses are also impacted as a result of the financial  accounting  legal and compliance and other additional expenses usually associated with operating as a public company 
we will also recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses stemming from our employee stock ownership plan and options and restricted stock granted to employees and executives 
these additional expenses adversely affect our profitability 
we recognize expenses for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants accounts and recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients pursuant to our equity incentive plan 
applying disciplined underwriting practices to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio 
we believe that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to grow and diversify the loan portfolio  while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk  using underwriting standards that we believe are conservative and diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
at december   our ratio of nonperforming loans loans which are or more days delinquent to total loans was of our total loan portfolio 
although we intend to continue our efforts to originate commercial real estate  commercial business and construction loans  we intend to continue our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through our conservative approach to lending

explanation of use of non gaap financial measurements 
we believe that it is common practice in the banking industry to present interest income and related yield information on tax exempt securities on a tax equivalent basis and that such information is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons among financial institutions 
however  the adjustment of interest income and yields on tax exempt securities to a tax equivalent amount may be considered to include non gaap financial information

risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  and technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
management performs a monthly review of all delinquent loans 
the actions taken with respect to delinquency vary depending upon the nature of the delinquent loans and the period of delinquency 
a late charge is normally assessed on loans where the scheduled payment remains unpaid after a day grace period 
after mailing delinquency notices  the company s collection department calls the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency and the repayment status 
through continued heightened account monitoring  collection  and workout efforts  the company attempts to work out a payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure 
if these actions do not result in a satisfactory resolution  the company refers the loan to legal counsel and counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
the company is committed to assist the homeowners to remain in their homes 
management reports to the executive committee monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent 
all loans that are delinquent greater than days  loans that are in foreclosure  and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own are reported in greater detail to the executive committee monthly 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets  loans that are days or more past due  and other loans which have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal to be nonperforming assets 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become days delinquent  at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned oreo until it is sold 
when property is acquired and placed into oreo  it is recorded at the fair price  less estimated selling expenses 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
as of december  and  the company had  and  classified as oreo  respectively

regulators have adopted various regulations and practices regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
under such regulations  federal and state examiners have authority to identify problem assets during examinations and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
we perform an internal analysis of our loan portfolio and assets to classify such loans and assets similar to the manner in which such loans and assets are classified by the federal banking regulators 
in addition  we regularly analyze the probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and our nonperforming loans to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
there are four classifications for problem assets special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
non accruing loans are normally classified as substandard 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is normally fully charged off 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified loans at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands special mention loans substandard loans doubtful loans loss loans total classified loans at december   special mention loans consisted of million in commercial loans  million in commercial construction loans  and million in commercial real estate loans 
substandard loans consisted of million in commercial loans   in commercial constructions loans  million in commercial real estate loans and million in residential real estate loans 
the decrease in classified loans was due to a decrease in nonperforming loans

analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount that management considers appropriate to cover inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified problem loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowance required for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified problem loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not delinquent to recognize the probable losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning percentages to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors include levels and historical trends in delinquencies  impaired loans  nonaccrual loans  charge offs  recoveries  and classified assets  trends in the volume and terms of loans  effects of any change in underwriting  policies  procedures  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  trends and conditions in the industries in which borrowers operate  effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan or a shortfall in collateral value would result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loan that was impaired 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased slightly from million at december  to million at december   due to a provision for loan losses of  partially offset by net charge offs of  the provision for loan losses in the year ended december  reflects management s assessment of several factors 
in particular  nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at december  from million at december  also  net charge offs decreased  from december  in addition  management assessed the continued growth of the loan portfolio  particularly the increases in commercial real estate loans  construction loans and commercial business loans  as well as the weakening of the local and national economy

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that our banking regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
our banking regulators may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

nonperforming loans consist of all loans days or more past due and other loans which have been identified by the company as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal 
interest rate risk management 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration  increasing our focus on shorter term  adjustable rate commercial and residential investment lending  selling fixed rate mortgage loans  and periodically selling available for sale securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management and one member of the board of directors  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee reports to the board of directors of the bank quarterly and establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
net interest income simulation analysis 
we use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
this model reports the net interest income at risk under seven primary different interest rate environments 
specifically  net interest income is measured in one scenario that assumes no change in interest rates  and six scenarios where interest rates increase basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates  and basis point increase over a month horizon  and a and basis point increase over a month time horizon and a decrease of basis points  from current rates over the one year time period following the current consolidated financial statements 
the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates reflect the rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the interest income from an adjustable rate loan is likely to increase depending on its repricing characteristics while the interest income from a fixed rate loan would not increase until the funds were repaid and loaned out at a higher interest rate 
the following table reflects changes in estimated net interest income for the company at december  through december  changes in interest rates basis points net interest income dollar change in estimated net interest income over twelve months percentage change in estimated net interest income over twelve months up months up months up months up months up instantaneous base down months as indicated in the table above  a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates and a basis point decrease in interest rates is estimated to decrease net interest income by and  respectively 
a and basis point increase over a month horizon  when compared to the flat rate scenario is projected to increase net interest income by and  respectively 
a and basis point increase in interest rates over a month period is estimated to increase net interest income by and in the first months 
the repricing and or new rates of assets and liabilities moved in tandem with market rates 
however  in certain deposit products  the use of data from a historical analysis indicated that the rates on these products would move only a fraction of the rate change amount 
pertinent data from each loan account  deposit account and investment security was used to calculate future cash flows 
the data included such items as maturity date  payment amount  next repricing date  repricing frequency  repricing index and spread 
prepayment speed assumptions were based upon the difference between the account rate and the current market rate 
the income simulation analysis was based upon a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions include but are not limited to asset mix  prepayment speeds  the timing and level of interest rates  and the shape of the yield curve 
as market conditions vary from the assumptions in the income simulation analysis  actual results will differ 
as a result  the income simulation analysis does not serve as a forecast of net interest income  nor do the calculations represent any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in all simulations  the lowest possible interest rate would be zero 
there are inherent shortcomings in any income simulation  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis 
the assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and the volume of other deposit flows 
although the analysis shown above provides an indication of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities  borrowings from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual loan repayment activity 
our short term investments primarily consist of us treasury and government agencies  which we use primarily for the collateral purposes for sweep accounts maintained by commercial customers 
the balances of these investments fluctuate as the aggregate balance of our sweep accounts fluctuate 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demands  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   total bank cash and cash equivalents totaled million  net of reserve requirements 
securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled  at december  other liquid assets as of december  include us treasury securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  net of pledged securities  of million  loans held for sale of million  and certificates of deposit of million 
on december   we had million of borrowings outstanding with the fhlb 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million based on the collateral pledged to the fhlb 
the company is able to pledge additional collateral to increase the availability of fhlb borrowings to of its asset base 
we have received approval from the federal reserve bank to access its discount window 
the company s unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank was approximately million at december  in addition  at december  we had the following contingency funding sources available a million available line of credit with the fhlb  which has been reduced from our fhlb availability based on pledged collateral  and an unsecured line of credit of million with bankers bank  ne during the year ended december   we did not utilize any of the three contingency funding sources 
future growth of our loan portfolio resulting from our expansion efforts may require us to borrow additional funds 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  which consisted of million in commercial loan commitments  million of mortgage loan commitments  and million in home equity and consumer commitments  million in unadvanced construction loan commitments  million in unused lines of credit  and million in standby letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table sets forth information relating to the company s payments due under contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than one to three to more than total one year three years five years five years in thousands long term debt operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits 
capital management 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the fdic  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
total stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily attributed to the company s stock repurchase plan  partially offset by net income of million and stock based compensation of million 
in  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock at a cost of million and an average per share price of 
our capital management strategies allowed us to increase our book value per share by  or  to at december  compared to at december  during and we repurchased approximately million  or  shares  and million  or  shares  of our stock  respectively 
in the future  we may also use other capital management tools such as cash dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future 
for the years ended december  and december   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
application of critical accounting policies 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
the information pertaining to the company s significant accounting policies is incorporated herein by reference to note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the discussion under critical accounting policies contained in item of this form k
