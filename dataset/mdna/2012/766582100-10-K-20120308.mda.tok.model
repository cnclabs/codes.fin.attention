item a 
risk factors our business has many risks 
factors that could materially affect our business  financial position  operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our units are described below 
this information should be considered carefully  together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec 
any loss of a rig on which our equipment is located will likely lead to a complete loss of our equipment on that rig and a loss of the revenue related to that rig 
at the commencement of a new service contract for a rig  we generally install approximately  to  worth of equipment on each offshore drilling rig 
if a rig were to sink or incur substantial damage for any reason  we would most likely lose all of our equipment 
we do not insure for such losses as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss 
in addition to the loss of the equipment  we would likely lose the revenue related to that rig under the terms of most of our existing contracts 
also  we may be committed to paying the costs to secure satellite bandwidth for that rig under agreements with third party satellite communication providers even after the rig is no longer in service 
losses of rigs can occur as a result of catastrophic events such as hurricanes  fire or sinking 
such catastrophic events can occur without notice  but have historically been infrequent 

table of contents many of our contracts with customers may be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customers may switch service providers without incurring significant expense relative to the annual cost of the service  and our agreements generally provide that in the event of prolonged loss of service or for other good reasons  our customers may terminate service without penalty 
in addition  many of our customer agreements may be terminated by our customers for no reason and upon short notice 
terms of customer agreements typically vary with a range of one month to three years  with some customer agreement terms as long as five years  and work orders placed under such agreements may have shorter terms than the relevant customer agreement 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our customers through the end of the terms specified in the customer agreements 
if we are not able to retain our customers  we would not receive expected revenues and may continue to incur costs  such as costs to secure satellite bandwidth for such customers under agreements with third party satellite communication services providers which may not be as easily or as quickly terminated without penalty  resulting in harm to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of a drilling contractor customer site can limit or eliminate our ability to provide services to other customers on the affected drilling rigs 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from two customers and the loss of either of these customers would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we receive a significant part of our revenue from a relatively small number of large customers 
for the year ended december   noble corporation and ensco plc represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
similarly  for the year ended december   these two significant customers  noble corporation and ensco plc  represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
if either of these two customers terminates or significantly reduces its business with us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
the telecommunications industry is generally highly competitive  and we expect both product and pricing competition to persist and intensify 
increased competition could cause reduced revenue  price reductions  reduced profits and loss of market share 
our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology 
as the prices of our products decrease  we will need to sell more products and or reduce the per unit costs to improve or maintain our results of operations 
our primary global competitors include harris corporation s harris caprock communications and elements of the enterprise segment of inmarsat plc s inmarsat solutions  as well as many regional competitors 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial and other resources for developing new solutions as well as for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
their greater financial resources may also make them better able to withstand downturns in the market  expand into new areas more aggressively or operate in developing markets without immediate financial returns 
in addition  in certain markets outside of the us  we face competition from local competitors that provide their services at a lower price due to lower overhead costs  including lower costs of complying with applicable government regulations  and due to their willingness to provide services for a lower profit margin 
strong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better solutions may make it difficult for us to maintain our customer base  force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new solutions 
furthermore  competition may emerge from companies that we have previously not perceived as competitors or consolidation of our industry may cause existing competitors to become bigger and stronger with more resources  market awareness and market share 
as we expand into new markets and geographic regions we may experience increased competition from some of our competitors that have prior experience or other business in these markets or geographic regions 
in addition  some of our customers may decide to insource some of the communications services and managed services solutions that we provide  in particular our terrestrial communication services eg  terrestrial line of sight transport  microwave  worldwide interoperability for microwave access  or wimax  which do not require the same level of maintenance and support as our other services 
our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces  to adapt to technological advances  to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  to continue to develop and deepen our global sales and business development network  and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our solutions rather than our competitors products and services or in sourced solutions 
our failure to successfully respond to these competitive challenges could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business 
failures by third party providers could harm our business and reputation and result in loss of customers and revenue 
a significant part of our operations and growth depends on third party providers delivering reliable communications connections  networks  equipment  and satellite transponder capacity  subjecting our business  reputation and customer revenue to risks beyond our control  such as telecommunications failures  saturation of communication connection points  networks and third party facilities in orbit risks for satellites including malfunctions  commonly referred to as anomalies  and collisions with meteoroids  decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris  satellite manufacturing or control system errors  lack of communication service alternatives  providing access to faulty equipment  human error  natural disasters  unexpected equipment failure  power loss  unauthorized access or security risks  and sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism 
even if we take precautions  the occurrence of any of these risks or other unanticipated problems arising from third party services could result in interruption in the services we provide to customers 
any of these occurrences could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure on our part to perform under our customer service contracts due to the failures of our third party providers could result in i loss of revenue despite continued obligations under our leasing arrangements  ii possible cancellation of customer contracts  iii incurrence of additional expenses to reposition customer antennas to alternative satellites or otherwise find alternate service iv inclusion in third party claims  and v damage to our reputation  which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new business 
under most of our contracts with satellite service providers  our satellite service providers do not indemnify us for such loss or damage to our business resulting from satellite failures 
if any potential claims result in liabilities  we could be required to pay damages or other penalties  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks and any unauthorized access to our clients data or systems could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations 
our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions  delays or malfunctions in our operations  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems  including reputational harm and litigation  caused by any breaches 
in addition  our customer contracts  in general  do not contain provisions which would protect us against liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business 
although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could lower system availability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we compete for satellite capacity for our services and any capacity constraints could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we compete for satellite capacity with a number of commercial entities  such as broadcasting companies  and governmental entities  such as the military 
in certain markets  the availability and pricing of capacity could be subject to competitive pressure  such as during renewals  and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed to conduct our operations at current rates or levels going forward 
this could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in certain markets  the availability of bandwidth may be restricted by the local government when needed to support its military  and in the event of such an action  there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed to conduct our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide key portions of our equipment and the loss of any of these key suppliers could materially harm our ability to service our clients and could result in loss of customers and harm our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations revenue 
we currently rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon a limited number of third party suppliers to supply the equipment required to provide our services  such as the equipment we install on offshore drilling rigs in order to provide remote communication services 
although this equipment is commercially available from more than one supplier  there are a limited number of suppliers of such equipment and price and quality vary among suppliers 
if the suppliers enter into competition with us  or if our competitors enter into exclusive or restrictive arrangements with our suppliers  the availability and pricing of the equipment that we purchase could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we like to use a small group of suppliers and standardized equipment as much as possible so that we are installing generally the same equipment and we can maintain smaller quantities of replacement parts and equipment in our warehouses 
if we have to change suppliers for any reason  we will incur additional costs due to the lack of uniformity and need to warehouse a broader array of replacement parts and equipment 
we are subject to the volatility of the global oil and gas industry and our business is likely to fluctuate with the level of global activity for oil and natural gas exploration  development and production 
our business depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of activity for oil and natural gas exploration  development and production 
demand for our remote communication services and collaborative applications depends on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore  develop and produce oil and natural gas in the regions in which we operate or may operate 
our business will suffer if these expenditures decline 
our customers willingness to explore  develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon prevailing market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices  the expected rate of decline in production  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to influence and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the worldwide political and military environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas of the middle east and other crude oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism in the united states  or elsewhere  the impact of changing regulations and environmental and safety rules and policies  including changes to regulations  rules and policies  following oil spills and other pollution by the oil and gas industry  and legislative and regulatory interest to limit or further regulate drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities  advances in exploration  development and production technology  the global economic environment  the political and legislative framework governing the activities of oil and natural gas companies  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 

table of contents the level of activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has historically been volatile and cyclical 
although we believe our customers will be dependent upon real time voice and data communication services to optimize their oil and gas production and development in an environment with lower energy prices  a prolonged significant reduction in the price of oil and natural gas will likely affect oil and natural gas production levels and therefore affect demand for the communication services we provide 
in addition  a prolonged significant reduction in the price of oil and natural gas could make it more difficult for us to collect outstanding account receivables from our customers 
a material decline in oil and natural gas prices or oil and natural gas exploration  development or production activity levels could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
bad weather in the gulf of mexico or other areas where we operate could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain areas in and near the gulf of mexico and other areas in which our clients operate experience unfavorable weather conditions  including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions  on a relatively frequent basis 
a major storm or threat of a major storm in these areas may harm our business 
our clients drilling rigs  production platforms and other vessels in these areas are susceptible to damage and or total loss by these storms  which may cause them to no longer need our communication services 
our equipment on these rigs  platforms or vessels could be damaged causing us to have service interruptions and lose business 
even the threat of a very large storm will sometimes cause our clients to limit activities in an area and thus harm our business 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  development  sales  services and management personnel 
in particular  we are heavily dependent on the following two key employees our chief executive officer and president  who has been critical to establishing our strategy and executing on our business model over the past four years  and our vice president of global engineering  who is the technical architect of our global network and who is responsible for our global network s reliability  performance and security and the evaluation of technological developments and their impact on our business 
the loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business  and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming  could cause additional disruptions to our business  and could be unsuccessful 
we do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  development  sales  services and management personnel  including personnel in all of the various regions of the world in which we operate 
the current increase in the activity level in the oil and gas industry and the limited supply of skilled labor has made the competition to retain and recruit qualified personnel intense 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could reduce our skilled labor force  increase the wages that we must pay to motivate  retain or recruit skilled employees or both 
in addition  wage inflation and the cost of retaining our key personnel in the face of competition for such personnel may increase our costs faster than we may offset these costs with increased prices or increased sales volume 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business may suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth in our business in recent periods  which has strained our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
we plan to continue to grow our business and anticipate that continued growth of our operations will be required to satisfy increasing customer demand and avail ourselves of new market opportunities 
the expanding scope and geographic breadth of our business and growth in the number of our employees  customers and locations will continue to place a significant strain on our management team  information technology systems and other resources and may distract key personnel from other key operations 
to properly manage our growth  we may need to hire and retain personnel  upgrade our existing operational  management and financial reporting systems  and improve our business processes and controls and implement those processes and controls in all of our geographic locations 
failure to effectively manage our growth in a cost effective manner could result in declines in service quality and customer satisfaction  increased costs or disruption of our operations 
our rapid growth also makes it difficult for us to adequately predict the investments we will need to make in the future to effectively manage our world wide operations 

table of contents we may need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations  and if we are unable to do so  our growth may be impaired 
we plan to pursue a growth strategy 
we have made significant investments to grow our business 
additional investments will be required to pursue further growth and to respond to technological innovations and competition 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms 
if financing is not available on satisfactory terms  or at all  we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
our term loan agreement places financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business  which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our term loan agreement restricts and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage  expand or pursue our business activities 
for example  our term loan agreement restricts our ability to dispose of property  enter into a merger  consolidate or acquire capital in other entities  incur additional indebtedness  incur liens on the property secured by the term loan agreement  make certain investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  pay cash dividends  commit to make capital expenditures not in the ordinary course of business  and enter into sales and lease back transactions 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions 
our term loan agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions  take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable  obtain future financing  fund needed capital expenditures  finance acquisitions  equipment purchases and development expenditures  or withstand a future downturn in our business 
our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our term loan agreement may be affected by events beyond our control 
if market or other economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired 
if we violate any of the restrictions  covenants  ratios or tests in our term loan agreement  a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable  and our lenders commitment to make further loans to us may terminate 
we might not have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
even if we could obtain alternative financing  that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
if we are unable to repay amounts borrowed  the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral 
in addition  our obligations under our term loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our term loan agreement  the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets 
if we infringe or if third parties assert that we infringe third party intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs and incur significant harm to our business 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us  which could result in substantial damages if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
even if claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management s attention from our other business concerns 

table of contents most of our contracts are on a fixed price basis and if our costs increase  we may not be able to recover these cost increases 
most of our contracts provide for a fixed price per month for our services 
if our costs increase to provide those services  such as the cost to secure bandwidth or personnel costs  we may not be able to offset some or all of our increased costs by increasing the rates we charge our customers until our next contract renewal  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our contracts are governed by non us law  which may make them more difficult or expensive to enforce than contracts governed by united states law 
many of our customer contracts are governed by non us law  which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict 
we operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited compared to regions with better established legal systems 
in addition  having to pursue litigation in a non us country may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the united states 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and if we fail to keep up with these changes or if access to telecommunications in remote locations becomes easier or less expensive  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology  new evolving standards  emerging competition and frequent new product and service introductions 
as an example of technological change  in august  inmarsat plc announced a major commitment to a new constellation of satellites using the ka frequency band branded as globalxpress  compared to our use of the ku band and c band satellite space segment today 
when this ka band service is made available in late and early  we may have to adapt to its use  contracting with either inmarsat or other satellite operators  which might impair our business if other providers are more successful in using ka band services to meet customer needs than us 
our future business prospects largely depend on our ability to meet changing customer preferences  to anticipate and respond to technological changes and to develop competitive products 
if telecommunications to remote locations becomes more readily accessible or less expensive than our services  our business will suffer 
new disruptive technologies could make our vsat based networks or other services obsolete or less competitive than they are today  requiring us to reduce the prices that we are able to charge for our services or causing us to undergo expensive transitions to new transport technologies 
we may not be able to successfully respond to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market opportunities  services or products offered by competitors 
in addition  our efforts to respond to technological innovations and competition may require significant capital investments and resources 
furthermore  we may not have the necessary resources to respond to new technological changes and innovations and emerging competition 
failure to keep up with future technological changes could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our potential clients are resistant to new solutions and technologies which may limit our growth 
although there is a strong focus on technology development within the oil industry  some of the companies in the upstream oil and gas industry are relatively conservative and risk averse with respect to adopting new solutions and technologies in the area of remote communications due to our services being so integral to highly complex drilling  completion and production operations 
some drilling contractors  oil and gas companies and oilfield service companies may choose not to adopt new solutions and technology  such as our remote communications and collaboration applications solutions  which may limit our growth potential 
the market for ip mpls based communication services is in a relatively early stage  and some oil and gas companies may choose not to adopt our ip mpls based communications technology 
this may in turn limit our growth 
we may face difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals for our provision of telecommunication services  and we may face changes in regulation  each of which could adversely affect our operations 
in a number of countries where we operate  the provision of telecommunication services is highly regulated 
in such countries  we are required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the services that we provide 
in many jurisdictions  we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees 
many of our customers utilize our services on mobile vessels or drilling platforms that may enter into new countries on short notice 
if we do not already have a license to provide our service in that country  we may be required to obtain a license or other regulatory approval on short notice  which may not be feasible in some countries 
failure to comply 
table of contents with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various sanctions including fines  penalties  arrests or criminal charges  loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations or cause us to delay or terminate our service to such vessel or platform until such license or regulatory approval may be obtained 
in some areas of international waters  it is ambiguous as to which country s regulations apply  if any  and thus difficult and costly for us to determine which licenses or other regulatory approvals we should obtain 
in such areas  we could be subject to various penalties or sanctions if we fail to comply with the applicable country s regulations 
future changes to the regulations under which we operate could make it difficult for us to obtain or maintain authorizations  increase our costs or make it easier or less expensive for our competitors to compete with us 
changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
our us services are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are therefore subject to light or no regulation by the federal communications commission  or fcc  and other federal  state and local agencies 
as a private carrier  we may not market and provide telecommunications service to the general public or otherwise hold our services out indifferently to the public as a common carrier 
as a private carrier  we are not entitled to certain rights afforded to or subject to certain obligations imposed on common carriers 
however  the fcc or one or more state public utility commissions could determine that our services or the services of our subsidiaries and or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings subject to title ii of the communications act  associated fcc regulations  and similar state laws 
among other things  common carriers must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates 
the fcc and state public utility commissions have jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding the compliance or non compliance with these and other common carrier requirements of the communications act and the fcc s rules  and similar state laws 
if our services or the services provided by our subsidiaries or affiliates are found to be provided on a common carrier basis  we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of these laws and regulations 
we may be subject to enforcement actions including  but not limited to  fines  cease and desist orders  or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements 
our international operations are regulated by various non us governments and international bodies 
these regulatory regimes frequently require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards 
the adoption of new laws or regulations  changes to the existing regulatory framework  new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations  or the loss of  or a material limitation on  any of our material licenses could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
voip services that permit subscribers to send calls to and receive calls from the traditional telephone network  known as interconnected voip services  are generally subject to the regulatory authority of the fcc and certain regulatory requirements 
we do not believe that the voice services that we currently provide were intended by the fcc to be considered interconnected voip 
however  the fcc could determine that our services or the services of our subsidiaries and or affiliates constitute interconnected voip  which could subject such services to a number of regulatory requirements including obligations to pay into the universal service fund  accommodate the needs of disabled persons  protect customer proprietary network information  provide e services  etc 
we cannot predict whether the fcc may classify our voip services as interconnected voip  and if so  what other regulatory obligations  if any  will be imposed on our voip services or interconnected voip services generally 
to the extent that our services or the services provided by our subsidiaries or affiliates are deemed to be interconnected voip services  we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable fcc requirements governing the provision of those services 
further  we may be subject to enforcement actions including  but not limited to  fines  cease and desist orders  or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements 
changes to the fcc s usf regime or state universal service fund regimes or findings that we have not complied with usf requirements or state universal service fund regimes may adversely affect our financial condition 
a proceeding pending before the fcc has the potential to significantly alter our universal service fund  or usf  contribution obligations 
the fcc is considering changing the basis upon which usf contributions are determined from a revenue percentage measurement  as well as increasing the breadth of the usf contribution base to include certain services now exempt from contribution 
adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our costs of providing service  our ability to separately list usf contributions on end user bills  and our ability to collect these fees from our customers 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding 

table of contents we cannot predict the application and impact of changes to the federal or state universal service fund contribution requirements on the communications industry generally and on certain of our business activities in particular 
we recently assessed the nature and extent of our federal and state universal service fund obligations 
if the fcc or any state determines that we have incorrectly calculated or failed to remit any required universal service fund contribution  we could be subject to the assessment and collection of past due remittances as well as interest and penalties thereon 
changes in the federal or state universal service fund requirements or findings that we have not met our obligations could materially increase our universal service fund contributions and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to a variety of federal and state regulatory actions that may affect our ability to operate 
federal and state telecommunications regulators have the right to sanction a service provider or to revoke licenses if a service provider violates applicable laws or regulations 
if any regulatory agency were to conclude that we were providing telecommunications services without the appropriate authority or are otherwise not in compliance with applicable regulations  the agency could initiate enforcement actions  which could result in  among other things  revocation of authority  the imposition of fines  a requirement to disgorge revenues  or refusal to grant regulatory authority necessary for the future provision of services 
our business operations in countries outside the united states are subject to a number of united states federal laws and regulations  including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of treasury and the united states department of commerce  which could adversely affect our operations if violated 
we must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the united states and other countries 
we cannot provide services to certain countries subject to united states trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign asset control of the united states department of the treasury or the united states department of commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations 
in addition  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act that  generally  prohibits bribes or unreasonable gifts to non us governments or officials and may be subject to anti corruption laws of other countries in which the company may operate or may otherwise have a substantial business connection 
violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines  more onerous compliance requirements  and more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business 
in certain countries  we engage third party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials  such as customs agents  and if these third party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws  their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us 
our international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our united states operations  which may harm our business and financial results 
we operate in approximately countries around the world  including countries in asia  the middle east  africa  latin america and europe and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate 
there are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our united states operations  including sometimes vague and confusing regulatory requirements that may be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations  import and export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically dispersed operations and culturally diverse work forces and increased travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  differences in employment laws and practices among different countries  including restrictions on terminating employees  differing technology standards  
table of contents fluctuations in currency exchange rates  imposition of currency exchange controls  potential political and economic instability in some regions  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  less due process and sometimes arbitrary application of laws and sanctions  including criminal charges and arrests  difficulties in raising awareness of applicable united states laws to our agents and third party intermediaries  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting receivables  difficulties and expense of maintaining international sales distribution channels  and difficulties in maintaining and protecting our intellectual property 
operating internationally exposes our business to increased regulatory and political risks in some non us jurisdictions where we operate 
in addition to changes in laws and regulations  changes in governments or changes in governmental policies in these jurisdictions may alter current interpretation of laws and regulations affecting our business 
we also face increased risk of incidents such as war or other international conflict and nationalization  and possible expropriation of our assets 
if a non us country were to nationalize our industry or expropriate our assets  we could lose not only our investment in the assets that we have in that country  but also all of our contracts and business in that country 
many of the countries in which we operate have legal systems that are less developed and less predictable than legal systems in western europe or the united states 
it may be difficult for us to obtain effective legal redress in the courts of some jurisdictions  whether in respect of a breach of law or regulation  or in an ownership dispute because of i a high degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities  which results in less predictability  ii a lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations  iii inconsistencies or conflicts between or within various laws  regulations  decrees  orders and resolutions  iv the relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters or v a predisposition in favor of local claimants against united states companies 
in certain jurisdictions  the commitment of local business people  government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be unreliable 
in particular  agreements may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or time consuming 
actions of governmental authorities or officers may adversely affect joint ventures  licenses  license applications or other legal arrangements  and such arrangements in these jurisdictions may not be effective or enforced

new rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our services 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry and telecommunications industry could harm our operations and financial results 
compliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results 
compliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries 
changes in tax laws or tax rates  the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities  disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct  or if we conduct  business in the affected countries 

table of contents changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors  including earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  repatriation of cash  or expiration or non utilization of net operating losses or credits 
we conduct our worldwide operations through various subsidiaries 
tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation 
consequently  we are subject to changing tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate  including treaties between the united states and other nations 
our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred 
a change in these tax laws  treaties or regulations  including those in and involving the united states  or in the interpretation thereof  could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings 
in addition  tax returns filed are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
outcomes from these continuous examinations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our united states federal income tax return is currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service 
we may incur material costs to support the audit and or defend our tax positions 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and limitations on the expatriation or conversion of currencies  which may result in significant financial charges  increased costs of operations or decreased demand for our products and services 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were earned in non us currencies  while a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures and all of our outstanding debt  was priced in us dollars 
in addition  we report our results of operations in us dollars 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or the value of our assets 
in the future  a greater portion of our revenues may be earned in non us currencies  increasing this risk of fluctuations in exchange rates 
any depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which we conduct business may result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may  at the same time  decrease demand for our products and services in the affected markets 
if our operating companies distribute dividends in local currencies in the future  the amount of cash we receive will also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  some of the countries in which we have operations do or may restrict the expatriation or conversion of currency 
we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
even if we were to implement hedging strategies  not every exposure can be hedged  and  where hedges are put in place based on expected non us exchange exposure  they are based on forecasts which may vary or which may later prove to have been inaccurate 
failure to hedge successfully or anticipate currency risks accurately could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our stockholders could together exert control over our company 
as of march   funds affiliated with altira group llc  or altira  owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately of our outstanding voting power 
additionally  as of march   funds associated with cubera secondary gp as  or cubera  owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately of our outstanding voting power 
as a result  these stockholders could together potentially have significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval  including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions 
the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the delaware general corporation law  may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or 
table of contents bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock  and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
in our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of each series without stockholder approval 
the ability to issue preferred stock could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our company  or otherwise could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own or more of our voting shares  or with their affiliates  unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner 
however  because funds affiliated with altira  cubera and sanders morris harris inc acquired their shares prior to the ipo  section is currently inapplicable to any business combination or transaction with them or their affiliates 
our bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures  which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations

if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of or recommendations regarding our stock  or if one or more of the analysts cease providing research coverage on our stock due to our small market capitalization or low trading volume  the price of our stock could decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease providing research coverage on our stock  we could lose visibility in the market for our stock  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline
