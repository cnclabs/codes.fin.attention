investment holdings as of june   we continue to pursue our investment strategy 
in may  we changed our name to prospect capital corporation and terminated our policy to invest at least of our net assets in energy companies 
since that time  we have reduced our exposure to the energy industry  and our holdings in the energy and energy related industries now represent less than of our investment portfolio 
at june  approximately  or of our net assets are invested in long term portfolio investments and of our net assets invested in money market funds 
during the year ended june   we originated  of new investments 
our origination efforts are focused primarily on secured lending  to reduce the risk in the portfolio  investing primarily in first lien loans  and subordinated notes in clos  though we also continue to close selected junior debt and equity investments 
in addition to targeting investments senior in corporate capital structures with our new originations  we have also increased our origination business mix of third party private equity sponsor owned companies  which tend to have more third party equity capital supporting our debt investments than non sponsor transactions 
our performing loan s annualized current yield increased from as of june  to as of june  across all long term investments 
this increase in yield is primarily due to the acquisition of first tower 
excluding our loans to first tower  our annualized current yield would have been as of june  we expect prospect s current asset yield may continue to decline modestly as we continue to reduce credit risk 
generally  we have seen a decrease in interest rates on first lien loans issued during our fiscal years ended june  and june  in comparison to the rates in effect at june  along with the effects from reducing the percentage level of second lien loans 
monetization of other equity positions that we hold is not included in this yield calculation 
in many of our portfolio companies we hold equity positions  ranging from minority interests to majority stakes  which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns 
some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns  preferred distributions  flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns  as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity  in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections

investment valuation in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june  the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firm having an aggregate range of  to  excluding money market investments 
in determining the range of value for debt instruments  the independent valuation firm generally shadow rated the investment and then based upon the range of ratings  determined appropriate yields 
table of contents to maturity for a loan rated as such 
a discounted cash flow analysis was then prepared using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate  yielding the ranges 
for equity investments  the enterprise value was determined by applying ebitda multiples for similar recent investment sales 
for stressed equity investments  a liquidation analysis was prepared 
the board of directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including recent operating and financial trends for the asset  independent ratings obtained from third parties and comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry 
the composite of all these analysis  applied to each investment  was a total valuation of  excluding money market investments 
our portfolio companies are generally lower middle market companies  outside of the financial sector  with less than  of annual ebitda 
we believe our market has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments 
control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
several control investments in our portfolio are under enhanced scrutiny by our senior management and our board of directors and are discussed below

net investment income decreased on a weighted average per share basis from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the per share decrease for the year ended june  is primarily due to a decrease in dividends from existing equity investments along with new equity investments in the portfolio which have not yet declared any dividends and the non recurring nature of the gain from the patriot acquisition during the year ended june  offset by an increase in structuring fees collected in the fiscal year ended june  while we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses  our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate 
these companies are typically not issuing securities rated investment grade  have limited resources  have limited operating history  have concentrated product lines or customers  are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents 
changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company

investment income is also generated from dividends and other income 
dividend income increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this  increase in dividend income is primarily attributed to an increase in the dividends received from our investments in energy solutions and nrg due to increased profits generated by the portfolio companies

investment valuation our board of directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio 
these procedures are detailed below 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
for most of our investments  market quotations are not available 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with the independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors  the independent valuation firms conduct independent appraisals and make their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
effective july   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 

table of contents asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by us at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
in april  the fasb issued asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly asc 
this update provides further clarification for asc in markets that are not active and provides additional guidance for determining when the volume of trading level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
asc is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of asc did not have any effect on our net asset value  financial position or results of operations as there was no change to the fair value measurement principles set forth in asc in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asc 
asu amends asc and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements related to recurring and non recurring fair value measurements and employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
asu is effective december   except for the disclosure about purchase  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  or july  for us and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of asc for the year ended june   did not have any effect on our financial statements 
federal and state income taxes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code of the code  applicable to regulated investment companies 
we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute or retain through a deemed distribution all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders  therefore  we have made no provision for income taxes 
the character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from gaap 
book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute at least of our annual income and of our capital gains in the calendar year earned  we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  we accrue excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is 
table of contents earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
if we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a ric in any taxable year  we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders  nor would we be required to make distributions 
distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate for taxable years beginning before but not for taxable years beginning thereafter  unless the relevant provisions are extended by legislation to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  provided certain holding period and other requirements are met 
subject to certain limitations under the code  corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
to qualify again to be taxed as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to distribute to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non ric years reduced by an interest charge of of such earnings and profits payable by us as an additional tax 
in addition  if we failed to qualify as a ric for a period greater than two taxable years  then  in order to qualify as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built in gain the excess of aggregate gain  including items of income  over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated or  alternatively  be subject to taxation on such built in gain recognized for a period of ten years 
we adopted fasb asc  income taxes asc 
asc provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
asc requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of asc was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of asc did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits 
management s determinations regarding asc may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including  but not limited to  an on going analysis of tax laws  regulations and interpretations thereof 
revenue recognition realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income 
interest income from investments in the equity class of security of clo funds typically income notes or subordinated notes is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with asc  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
we monitor the expected cash inflows from our clo equity investments  including the expected residual payments and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically 

table of contents loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
as of june   approximately of our net assets are in non accrual status 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned  usually when paid 
structuring fees  excess deal deposits  net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income 
dividends and distributions dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex dividend date 
the amount  if any  to be paid as a dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon our management s estimate of our earnings for the quarter 
net realized capital gains  if any  are distributed at least annually 
financing costs we record origination expenses related to our credit facility and senior notes as deferred financing costs 
these expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight line method for our revolving credit facility and the effective interest method for our senior notes  over the respective expected life 
we record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid assets 
these expenses consist principally of securities and exchange commission sec registration fees  legal fees and accounting fees incurred 
these prepaid assets will be charged to capital upon the receipt of an equity offering proceeds or charged to expense if no offering completed 
guarantees and indemnification agreements we follow asc  guarantees asc 
asc elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  for those guarantees that are covered by asc  the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees 
per share information net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations per common share are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented 
in accordance with asc  financial services investment companies  convertible securities are not considered in the calculation of net assets per share

table of contents disclosure about purchase  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  or july  for us and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of amended guidance in asu did not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update  receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring asu 
asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist a the restructuring constitutes a concession  and b the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
asu provides guidance to clarify whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or july  for us 
the adoption of the amended guidance in asu did not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements asc by clarifying that the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts only apply to measuring the fair value of non financial assets  allowing a reporting entity to measure the fair value of the net asset or net liability position in a manner consistent with how market participants would price the net risk position  if certain criteria are met  providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement  providing that the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity is estimated from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item as an asset  and expanding the qualitative and quantitative fair value disclosure requirements 
the expanded disclosures include  for level items  a description of the valuation process and a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs if a change in those inputs would result in a significantly different fair value measurement 
asu also requires disclosures about the highest and best use of a non financial asset when this use differs from the asset s current use and the reasons for such a difference 
in addition  this asu amends accounting standards codification  fair value measurements  to require disclosures to include any transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
these amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the amendments of asu  when adopted  are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price risk 
some of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the twelve months ended june   we did not engage in hedging activities
