overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and for use by healthcare providers in the hospital for the treatment of both diabetic and non diabetic patients 
the majority of our product revenue comes from sales of our seven plus ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring system  which we began commercializing in the first quarter of we also have received ce mark approval for the glucoclear in hospital system  and in partnership with edwards  we initiated a very limited launch of the glucoclear system in europe in from inception to  we devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
since  we have devoted considerable resources to the commercialization of our ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring systems  including the seven plus  as well as the continued research and clinical development of our technology platform 
from inception through december   we generated million of product and development grant and other non product revenue  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in may from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we proceed with our commercialization and research and development activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of equity securities and convertible debt 
in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  we entered into a loan agreement  which was subsequently amended in january in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of convertible senior notes due in  all of which convertible senior notes have converted into shares of our common stock 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million

in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents financial operations revenue from inception through december   we generated million in product revenue from the sale of our continuous glucose monitoring systems 
we expect that revenues we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a joint development agreement with animas under which we recognize development grant and other revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the development period 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a collaboration agreement with edwards under which we recognize development grant and other revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the development period 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with roche under which we recognize development grant and other revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the development period 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with tandem under which we will recognize development grant and other revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the development period 
we recognize development milestones associated with each agreement as revenue upon achievement of each milestone if the milestone is considered substantive 
from inception through december   we recognized million in development grant and other revenue  which includes milestones and services 
cost of sales product cost of sales includes direct labor and materials costs related to each product sold or produced  including assembly  test labor and scrap  as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations 
factory overhead includes facilities  material procurement and control  manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  supervision and management 
these costs are primarily salary  fringe benefits  share based compensation  facility expense  supplies and purchased services 
the majority of our costs are currently fixed due to our relatively low production volumes compared to our potential capacity 
all of our manufacturing costs are included in product cost of sales 
development and other cost of sales consists primarily of salaries  fringe  facilities  and supplies directly attributable to our development contracts 
research and development our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology  clinical trials  regulatory expenses  quality assurance programs  materials and products for clinical trials 
research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation  including salary  fringe benefits  share based compensation  and temporary employee expenses 
we also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including clinical site reimbursement  clinical trial product and associated travel expenses 
our research and development expenses also include fees for design services  contractors and development materials 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary  fringe benefits and share based compensation for our executive  financial  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
other significant expenses include trade show expenses  sales samples  insurance  professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors  litigation expenses and consulting expenses 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross profit product revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  based primarily on increased sales 
table of contents volume of our durable systems and disposable sensors  and higher average per unit selling prices 
product cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increased product cost of sales associated with additional product sales was offset primarily by increased manufacturing absorption for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the product gross profit of million for the twelve months ended december  increased million compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue and improved manufacturing absorption 
development grant and other revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  development and other cost of sales decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in development grant and other revenues during the twelve months ended december  was due to additional services performed and the million milestone payment received from animas for ce mark approval  and was partially offset by extended development and regulatory review timelines under our collaboration arrangements with edwards and animas 
the decrease in costs associated with development was primarily due to fewer development obligations during the year with respect to our collaboration arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased development efforts for our future generation ambulatory products and by decreased activity with respect to our development and collaboration agreements 
major elements of increased research and development costs include million in additional consulting costs  million in additional salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  and million in additional share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher selling  customer operations  and information technology costs to support revenue growth and the continued commercialization of our products 
major elements of increased selling  general  and administrative expenses include million in higher salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in higher share based compensation  and million in higher facility costs 
interest income 
interest income increased  to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average interest bearing cash and marketable securities balances offset by lower yields earned on those balances during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the conversion of all of the outstanding convertible notes in fiscal year ended december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross profit product revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  based primarily on increased sales volume of our durable systems and disposable sensors  and higher average per unit selling prices 
product cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to 
table of contents million for the twelve months ended december  the increased product cost of sales associated with additional product sales was offset primarily by increased manufacturing absorption for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the product gross profit of million for the twelve months ended december  increased million compared to a loss of million for the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue and improved direct labor utilization 
during the twelve months ended december   we increased overall inventory levels to meet sales forecast requirements and in anticipation of flextronics relocation of its production site from california to china 
flextronics  which manufactures our ambulatory hardware components  relocated its production lines during the first calendar quarter of the increase in our inventory levels resulted in additional absorption of manufacturing costs and a corresponding nominal improvement in product gross margin 
development grant and other revenues decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  development and other cost of sales decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in development grant and other revenues during the twelve months ended december  was based on longer than expected development and regulatory review timelines under our collaboration arrangements with edwards and animas 
the decrease in costs associated with development was primarily due to fewer development obligations during the year with respect to our collaboration arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased development efforts for our future generation ambulatory products and by decreased activity with respect to our development and collaboration agreements 
major elements of increased research and development costs include million in additional salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in additional share based compensation  and million in additional facilities costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher selling  information technology  and international development costs to support revenue growth and the continued commercialization of our products 
major elements of increased selling  general  and administrative expenses include million in higher salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in higher depreciation expense  and million in higher commissions 
interest income 
interest income decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average interest bearing cash and marketable securities balances and lower yields earned on those balances during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower non cash interest expense relating to the accretion of the debt discount for the senior convertible notes the notes issued in march  and lower coupon interest expense relating to the notes outstanding as a result of the conversions of the notes that occurred during the twelve months ended december  loss on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt for the twelve months ended december   we completed exchanges with prior holders of our issued and outstanding notes  under which we issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common 
table of contents stock  par value per share  in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of the notes previously held by the exchanging holders 
we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the notes in the amount of million for the twelve months ended december   which includes the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the notes on the conversion date  other consideration given to note holders to induce early conversion and transaction costs incurred with third parties  other than the investors  to settle the conversion of the notes 
liquidity and capital resources we are in the early commercialization stage and have incurred losses since our inception in may as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had working capital of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million  excluding million in restricted cash 
we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities and our bank line 
in january  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to million in lower net loss and million in lower changes in operating assets and liabilities  offset by million in lower non cash charges primarily comprised of loss on the extinguishment of debt upon conversion of our notes 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period of the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to million increase in cash used to purchase available for sale marketable securities offset by million increase in proceeds from the maturity of available for sale marketable securities for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in for the twelve months ended december   we invested million in equipment to support manufacturing improvements compared to million during the same period in net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period of the increase was primarily due to the approximately million in net proceeds generated by the sale of common stock in the follow on public offering completed in may for the twelve months ending december  compared to approximately million in the same period of operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we incur expenses to continue to expand the commercialization of our approved products  develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products  and expand our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities balances  and projected cash contributions from existing partnership arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements with respect to the continued scale up of our commercialization activities  research and development activities  including clinical trials  the expansion of our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure  and to meet our other anticipated cash needs through at least december  if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale 
table of contents of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional cash contributions from future partnership arrangements 
our ability to transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure 
if events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected  or if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned increases in compensation related expenses or other operating expenses related to research  development  and commercialization activities  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of continuous glucose monitoring technologies  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the revenue generated by sales of our approved products and other future products  the expenses we incur in manufacturing  developing  selling and marketing our products  the quality levels of our products and services  the third party reimbursement of our products for our customers  our ability to efficiently scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products  the costs  timing and risks of delays of additional regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  defending the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by abbott  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to acquire the stock of sweetspot diabetes care  inc sweetspot 
sweetspot is a healthcare focused information technology company with a platform for uploading and processing data from diabetes devices to advance the treatment of diabetes 
sweetspot specializes in turning raw output from patient devices into information for healthcare providers  patients and researchers 
through our planned acquisition of sweetspot  we will have a software platform that enables our patients to aggregate and analyze data from numerous diabetes devices and share it with their healthcare providers 
the acquisition could increase our cost structure or divert management s attention more than anticipated 
contractual obligations on january   we amended our bank equipment loan to enable us to draw an additional million 
beginning april  this additional amount requires monthly amortized payments through the maturity date of july as of december   there were no outstanding amounts due on this bank equipment loan 
in april  we entered into an office lease agreement for approximately  square feet of additional facilities located in san diego  california 
in connection with the lease  we entered into a  letter of credit to secure future payments under the lease and paid a security deposit in the amount of  in april in august  we entered into a first amendment to office lease the lease amendment with respect to facilities in the buildings at sequence drive and sequence drive  each in san diego  california the buildings 
under the lease amendment  we have leased approximately  square feet of space in the buildings  and retain the right and obligation to lease an additional  square feet in the 
table of contents buildings 
the lease term for the buildings extends through november and we have a five year option to renew the lease upon the expiration of the initial term 
excluding real estate taxes and operating costs  we are required to make total future monthly payments for all of our real estate obligations for the period from january through november totaling million 
we are party to various purchase arrangements related to components used in production and research and development activities 
as of december   we had purchase commitments with certain vendors totaling approximately million due within one year 
there are no material purchase commitments due beyond one year 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we sell durable systems and disposable units through a direct sales force in the united states as well as through distribution arrangements in the united states  israel and in portions of europe 
components are individually priced and can be purchased separately or together 
the seven plus durable system includes a transmitter  a receiver  a power cord  data management software and a usb cable 
disposable sensors for use with the seven plus system are sold separately in packages of four 
the initial seven plus durable system price is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable sensors 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue on product sales is generally recognized upon shipment  which is when title and the risk of loss have been 
table of contents transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
with respect to customers who directly pay for the products  the products are generally paid for at the time of shipment using a customer s credit card and do not include customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue from contracted insurance payors based on the contracted rate 
for non contracted insurance payors  we obtain a prior authorization from the payor and recognize revenue based on the agreed upon price  estimated collectible amount and historical experience 
we also receive a prescription or statement of medical necessity and  for insurance reimbursement customers  an assignment of benefits prior to shipment 
we provide a day money back guarantee program whereby customers who purchase the seven plus durable system and a package of four disposable sensors may return the seven plus durable system for any reason within thirty days of purchase and receive a full refund of their purchase price 
at december   we maintained a reserve balance of  relating to this program 
we accrue for estimated returns and or refunds by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with edgepark  as amended on march   as well as agreements with other distributors that allow the distributors to sell our durable systems and disposable units 
revenue on product sales to distributors is generally recognized at the time of shipment  which is when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor and there are no other post shipment obligations 
revenue is recognized based on contracted prices and invoices are either paid by check following the issuance of a purchase order or letter of credit  or they are paid by wire at the time of placing the order 
terms of distributor orders are generally freight on board fob shipping point free carrier fca shipping point for international orders 
distributors do not have rights of return per their distribution agreement outside of our standard warranty 
we accrue for estimated returns  refunds and rebates by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
our distributors typically have a limited time frame to notify us of any missing  damaged  defective or non conforming products 
for any such products  we shall either  at our option  replace the portion of defective or non conforming product at no additional cost to the distributor or cancel the order and refund any portion of the price paid to us at that time for the sale in question 
we have no intention of refunding or unwinding a prior sale and view any potential product non conformity solely as a warranty issue 
we shipped product directly to certain distributors customers and recognized million and million in revenue  which represents and of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
with respect to other distributors which stock inventory of our product and fulfill orders from their inventory  we shipped product to these distributors and recognized million and million in revenue from these arrangements  which represents and of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we monitor shipments to  and on hand inventory levels of  these distributors  and at december  these distributors had limited amounts of our product in their inventory 
one of our distributors  edgepark  accounted for million and million in revenue  which represents of our total revenues for each of the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
during  and  we entered into collaborative license and development arrangements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of products utilizing our technologies 
the terms of these agreements obligate us to multiple deliverables for example  license rights  provision of research and development services  and manufacture of clinical materials in exchange for our right to receive various forms of consideration including non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
with the exception of royalties  these types of consideration are classified as development grant and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and are generally recognized 
table of contents over the service period except for substantive milestone payments  which are generally recognized when the milestone is achieved 
in determining whether each milestone is substantive  we considered whether the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should i be commensurate with either a our performance to achieve the milestone or b the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relate solely to past performance and iii be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
we recognize royalties in the period in which we obtain the royalty report  which is necessary to determine the amount of royalties we are entitled to receive 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license  development and other multiple element service arrangements  are analyzed to determine how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting  or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
for transactions containing multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   we consider deliverables as separate units of accounting and recognize deliverables as revenue upon delivery only if i the deliverable has stand alone value and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is probable and substantially controlled by us 
we allocate consideration to the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method  in which allocation of consideration is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe  or if vsoe or tpe is not available  management s best estimate of a stand alone selling price for elements 
for transactions containing multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january   we considered deliverables as separate units of accounting and recognized deliverables as revenue upon delivery only if i the deliverable had stand alone value  ii if the arrangement included a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s was probable and substantially controlled by us  and iii the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
if we were unable to establish stand alone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
we use judgment in estimating the value allocable to the deliverables in an agreement 
these deliverables typically include product revenues or development grant and other revenue based on our estimate of the fair value or relative selling price attributable to the related deliverables 
for arrangements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  total payments under the arrangement are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
we review the estimated period of our performance obligations on a periodic basis and update the recognition period as appropriate 
the cumulative amount of revenue earned is limited to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
deferred revenue amounts are classified as current liabilities to the extent that revenue is expected to be recognized within one year 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with animas  as amended on january   july  and june   which provided us with a development grant 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a collaboration agreement with edwards  as amended on may   which provided us with a development grant 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with roche which provided us with a development milestone 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a development agreement with tandem which provided us with a development milestone 
we recognized million in development grant and other revenue for the twelve months ended december   respectively 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue relating to our development and other agreements 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants including employee stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
share based compensation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options  restricted stock and restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods as share based compensation expense using the straight line single option method in our consolidated statement of operations 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock options granted and we use the grant date fair value of our common stock for valuing restricted stock unit awards 
our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  for estimated excess  obsolete and potential scrapped inventories 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventories by identifying the amount of on hand and on order materials and comparing those to expected future sales for the next twelve months  taking into account clinical trial and development usage along with new product introductions on a part by part basis 
once written down the adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 
we utilize a standard cost system to track inventories on a part by part basis that approximates first in  first out 
if 
table of contents necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs 
the labor and overhead elements of our inventory are based on full utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical study expenses  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations  physicians and participating hospitals 
these expenses can be a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue expenses for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
expenses for setting up clinical trial sites and study initiation are accrued immediately 
clinical expenses related to patient enrollment and ongoing monitoring are accrued as the trials progress 
warranty accrual we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of shipment 
we estimate warranty accruals by analyzing the timing  cost and amount of returned product 
we evaluate assumptions and historical warranty experience on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of such assumptions 
bonus accrual for the bonus plan  the compensation committee authorized an amount of up to of salary and wages for non sales employees to be awarded from the pool based on the weighted average achievement measured against certain objectives 
as various targets were met  we incurred million in bonus compensation for the year ended december  foreign currency the consolidated financial statements of our non us subsidiary  whose functional currency is the swedish krona  are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
assets and liabilities are translated at period end exchange rates  and revenue and expense transactions are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as part of comprehensive income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency are reflected in operations 
income taxes in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  the authoritative guidance provides detail on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of the authoritative guidance 
we file income tax returns in the united states and in various state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
due to net operating losses incurred  our income tax returns from inception to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had no interest or penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents short term marketable securities we have classified our short term investments as available for sale and carry them at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in comprehensive loss 
realized gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method and recorded as interest income 
we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity 
fair value measurements the fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value and include the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we base the fair value of our level financial instruments that are in active markets using quoted market prices for identical instruments 
our level financial instruments include money market funds and certificates of deposit 
we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments  which are not in active markets  from a primary professional pricing source using quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments  rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets 
fair value obtained from this professional pricing source can also be based on pricing models whereby all significant observable inputs  including maturity dates  issue dates  settlement date  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issue spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers or other market related data  are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
we validate the quoted market prices provided by our primary pricing service by comparing the fair values of our level investment portfolio balance provided by our primary pricing service against the fair values of our level investment portfolio balance provided by our investment managers 
we did not own any level financial assets or liabilities as of december  or the book values of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb reached a consensus on the milestone method of revenue recognition which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the provisions of the guidance as of january  on a prospective basis 
the prospective application had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the issuance of the guidance is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance supersedes the presentation options in previous guidance and facilitates convergence of us gaap and ifrs by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after december  we do not believe the adoption of the guidance in the first quarter of will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for the deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments are being made to allow the board time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while the board is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements previously in effect 
this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements
