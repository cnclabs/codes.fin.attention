item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business strategy our objective is to provide our shareholders with total returns over time 
the core components of our business strategy are described in more detail below 
provide commercial real estate financing 
we provide a comprehensive set of debt financing options to the commercial real estate industry  including commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans  cmbs eligible loans  other 
table of contents loans and preferred equity interests 
see our investment portfolio commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans  other loans and preferred equity interests below for a description of the investment portfolio resulting from this strategy 
own commercial real estate 
our ownership of commercial real estate has grown recently as we have restructured loans in response to credit events to take control of properties where we believe we can continue to generate or enhance our risk adjusted returns 
during  our efforts to stabilize these properties contributed to increased overall occupancy from at december  to at december  we continue to expand our internal multifamily property management capabilities through our subsidiary jupiter communities  llc  or jupiter communities  and our internal office property management capabilities through our subsidiary crp commercial services  llc  or crp commercial services 
sponsoring non traded reits 
we are sponsoring the initial public offering of a non traded reit  independence realty trust  inc  or irt  to acquire a diversified portfolio of multifamily properties  and may seek to sponsor other companies to own commercial real estate 
we are also sponsoring the initial public offering of a non traded reit  independence mortgage trust  inc  or imt  to originate  acquire and manage a portfolio of commercial real estate loans  commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  and other commercial real estate related securities  and may seek to sponsor other companies to engage in commercial real estate financing 
we refer to irt and imt as our sponsored reits and to all the companies we sponsor as the sponsored companies 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sponsored companies for further discussion of this strategy 
manage our portfolio of debt securities issued by real estate companies 
included in our assets are debt securities issued by real estate companies 
as noted above  we do not expect to originate new investments in this portfolio in order to focus on commercial real estate loans and properties 
we continue to manage the debt securities remaining in our portfolio and earn senior management fees 
see our investment portfolio investment in debt securities below for a description of the investment portfolio resulting from this strategy 
generate fee income 
we manage a portfolio of real estate related assets 
as of december   we had billion of assets under management 
assets under management are comprised of our consolidated assets and assets we manage but do not consolidate 
at december   we served as the collateral manager on five securitizations that are collateralized by us commercial real estate investments  trups and various real estate related debt securities 
we use the term securitizations to refer to either the issuer of securitizations or the securitizations themselves  where the context makes the reference clear 
we generate fee income from our asset management efforts  primarily from serving as collateral manager 
with respect to our sponsored reits and other sponsored companies  we plan to serve as their advisor regarding investments and earn advisory fees 
we will serve as the dealer manager of the offerings of our sponsored reits and other sponsored companies  which we refer to collectively as the sponsored companies  and to earn fees in this role 
we also service our us commercial real estate investments 
we are rated as a commercial mortgage primary servicer and special servicer by standard poor s and by morningstar 
we also provide property management services on multi family  office and retail properties for our own account and for third parties through jupiter communities and crp commercial services 
financing strategy investments in loans and debt securities our strategy involves using multiple sources of short term financing to acquire assets with the ultimate goal of financing these investments on a long term  match funded basis or selling these assets 
match funding enables us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing  thereby reducing interest rate risk and funding risks in financing our portfolio on a long term basis 
we expect to use a variety of short term funding sources  including warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements and bank credit facilities  until we obtain permanent long term financing or a buyer for the asset 
this includes using short term financing to originate cmbs eligible loans prior to their ultimate sale to cmbs securitizations 
we 
table of contents financed a majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio through two non recourse loan securitizations  rait cre cdo i  ltd  or rait i  and rait preferred funding ii  ltd  or rait ii  which aggregate billion of loan capacity 
rait i and rait ii are among the five securitizations referenced above where we serve as collateral manager 
rait ii has reinvestment rights that permit us to replace maturing loan collateral with new loans up through the fifth year anniversary in june see securitization summary below 
we financed most of our debt securities portfolio in a series of non recourse debt securities securitizations which provided long term  interest only  match funded financing for the trups and subordinated debenture investments 
as of december   we retained a controlling interest in two securitizations  taberna preferred funding viii  ltd  or taberna viii  and taberna preferred funding ix  ltd  or taberna ix  which are consolidated entities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securitization summary below 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings 
reits generally are able to enter into transactions to hedge indebtedness used to acquire real estate assets  provided that the total gross income from such hedges and other non qualifying sources does not exceed of the reit s total gross income 
investments in real estate we have financed our portfolio of investments in commercial real estate through secured mortgages held by either third party lenders or our commercial real estate securitizations 
upon conversion of commercial real estate loans to real estate investments  we generally keep the existing financing provided by rait i and rait ii 
our investment portfolio our consolidated investment portfolio is currently comprised of the following asset classes commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans  other loans and preferred equity interests 
we originate and own senior long term mortgage loans  short term bridge loans  subordinated  or mezzanine  financing and preferred equity interests 
these assets are in most cases non recourse or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities 
this means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment  subject to certain standard exceptions 
we may from time to time acquire existing commercial real estate loans from third parties who have originated such loans  including banks  other institutional lenders or third party investors 
where possible  we seek to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers  as opposed to investing in loans controlled by third party lenders

investment in debt securities trups and subordinated debentures 
historically  we provided reits and real estate operating companies the ability to raise subordinated debt capital through trups and subordinated debentures 
trups are long term instruments  with maturities ranging from to years  which are priced based on short term variable rates  such as the three month london inter bank offered rate  or libor 
trups are unsecured and generally contain minimal financial and operating covenants 
we financed most of our debt securities portfolio in a series of non recourse securitizations which provided long dated  interest only  match funded financing to the trups and subordinated debenture investments 
as of december   we retained a controlling interest in two such securitizations taberna viii and taberna ix  which are consolidated entities 
we present all of the collateral assets for the debt securities and the related non recourse securitization financing obligations at fair value in our consolidated financial statements 
during  due to the credit performance of the underlying collateral  we received only our senior collateral management fees from these two securitizations 
we do not expect to add investments in this asset category for the foreseeable future due to market conditions

investment in debt securities other real estate related debt securities 
we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  in cmbs  unsecured reit notes and other real estate related debt securities 
unsecured reit notes are publicly traded debentures issued by large publicly reporting reits and other real estate companies 
these debentures generally pay interest semi annually 
cmbs generally are multi class debt or pass through certificates secured or backed by single loans or pools of mortgage loans on commercial real estate properties 
our cmbs investments may include loans and securities that are rated investment grade by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies  as well as both unrated and non investment grade loans and securities

we also conduct the operations of our subsidiary  taberna realty finance trust  or taberna  the sponsored reits and any reits we may sponsor in the future  which we collectively refer to as the reit affiliates  to each qualify as a reit 
for a discussion of the tax implications of our and the reit affiliates reit status to us and our shareholders  see material us federal income tax considerations contained in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
to qualify as a reit  we and the reit affiliates must continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income  nature and diversification of assets  amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares 
in order to satisfy these tests  we and the reit affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made 
accordingly  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our or the reit affiliates investment performance 
these requirements include the following for each of ourselves and the reit affiliates  at least of total assets and of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets  whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our or the reit affiliates best investment alternative 
for example  since neither trups nor investments in the debt or equity of securitizations are qualifying real estate assets  to the extent that we 
table of contents have historically invested in such assets  or may do so in the future  taberna and we  to the extent that we invest in such assets must hold substantial investments in qualifying real estate assets  including mortgage loans and cmbs  which may have lower yields than such investments 
also  at least of each of our and the reit affiliates gross income in each taxable year  excluding gross income from prohibited transactions  must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the gross income test described above  as well as other dividends  interest  and gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities  which need not have any relation to real property 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  but including any mortgage loans  held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities  and therefore may limit our and the reit affiliates ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss 
our trss that currently hold assets include rait jupiter holdings  llc the holding company for our interest in jupiter communities  rait trs  llc the holding company for advisors of our sponsored companies and independence securities  taberna capital management  llc the collateral manager for taberna viii and taberna ix  or tcm  and rait funding llc the holding company for crp commercial services  the entities that issued our junior subordinated notes  the entities party to our cmbs facilities referred to below  taberna viii  taberna ix and their co issuers 
our and the reit affiliates ability to grow or expand the fee generating businesses held in a trss  as well as the business of future trss we or the reit affiliates may form  will be limited by our and the reit affiliates need to meet this test 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code limit our and the reit affiliates ability to hedge mortgage backed securities  preferred securities and related borrowings 
except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the us treasury department  or the treasury regulations  any income from a hedging transaction we or the reit affiliates enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made  or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred  to acquire or carry real estate assets  which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired  originated  or entered into  including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction  will not constitute gross income for purposes of the gross income test and will generally constitute non qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
to the extent that we or the reit affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions  the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests 
as a result  we or the reit affiliates might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through trss 
this could increase the cost of our or the reit affiliates hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear 
there are other risks arising out of our and the reit affiliates need to comply with reit requirements 
see item a risk factors tax risks below 
investment company act limits we seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company 
under section a of the investment company act  a company is not deemed to be an investment company if it neither is  nor holds itself out as being  engaged primarily  nor proposes to engage primarily  in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  and 
table of contents it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
investment securities excludes us government securities and securities of majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act 
we rely on the test 
because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act  together with any other investment securities we may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis 
in fact  based on the relative value of our investment in taberna  on the one hand  and our investment in rait partnership  lp  or rait partnership  on the other hand  we can comply with the test only if taberna satisfies the test on which it relies or another exemption other than section c or c and rait partnership complies with section c c or c  the exemptions upon which it relies or another exemption other than section c or c 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries 
none of rait  rait partnership or taberna has received a no action letter from the sec regarding whether it complies with the investment company act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the investment company act that it is using 
to the extent that the sec provides more specific or different guidance regarding  for example  the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate related assets  we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly 
see item a risk factors other regulatory and legal risks of our business loss of our investment company act exemption would affect us adversely 
competition we are subject to significant competition in all aspects of our business 
existing industry participants and potential new entrants compete with us for the available supply of investments suitable for origination or acquisition  as well as for debt and equity capital 
with respect to our sponsored companies  we compete with other sponsors of offerings by commercial real estate businesses for access to debt and equity capital 
we compete with many third parties engaged in real estate finance and investment activities  including other reits  specialty finance companies  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  institutional investors  investment banking firms  lenders  governmental bodies and other entities 
with respect to our investments in real estate  we face significant competition from other owners  operators and developers of properties  many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate 
competition may increase  and other companies and funds with investment objectives similar to ours may be organized in the future 
some of these competitors have  or in the future may have  substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk 
they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from  among other things  a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies 
in addition  competition may lead us to pay a greater portion of the origination fees that we expect to collect in our future origination activities to third party investment banks and brokers that introduce borrowers to us in order to continue to generate new business from these sources 
employees as of february   we had employees and believe our relationships with our employees to be good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item a 
risk factors this section describes material risks affecting our business 
risks related to our business adverse developments in the credit markets have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on our investments and our operating results  including reduced availability of financing to us and for refinancing to our borrowers  payment defaults and other credit risks in our investments  decreases in the fair value of our assets and decreases in the cash flow we receive from our investments 
adverse developments in the credit markets have substantially reduced the availability of financing for many real estate sectors in which we and the companies we finance operate 
this has reduced  and may continue to reduce  the amount of capital we have available to make new investments  contributing to the reduction of our assets under management  and the reduction of income and fees derived from our investments 
these developments have adversely affected many real estate sectors in which the companies we finance operate  resulting in increasing credit risk relating to  and payment defaults in  our investments 
this has reduced  and may continue to reduce  the revenue and cash flow we receive from our investments and the fair value of our investments and has resulted in  and may continue to cause  material asset impairment of these investments 
our response to these developments has required  and may continue to require  us to change our business strategy  including the types of investments we make  how we finance them and our dividend policies  from our historical approaches 
our business requires a substantial amount of liquidity to fund investments  to pay expenses and to acquire and hold assets 
as reits  we must distribute at least of reit taxable income to our respective shareholders  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain  which substantially limits our ability to accumulate cash from our operations 
developments in the capital markets have substantially reduced the debt capital and equity capital available to us and has adversely affected our ability to make investments 
with respect to debt capital  we believe many of the types of financing arrangements we used historically will be available at reduced levels for the foreseeable future  including repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit for short term financing and securitizations for long term financing of our investments 
our continued use of secured bank financing will depend on our ability to negotiate renewals of our current line of credit when it matures and to obtain new secured bank financing on acceptable terms 
we have historically issued debt securities to one or more institutional investors from time to time as market conditions permitted  particularly our trust preferred securities  or trups  and our convertible senior notes due  or the convertible senior notes 
our opportunities to issue additional debt may be limited for the foreseeable future 
with respect to equity capital  we believe the market for our common shares and preferred shares has contracted and may continue to be limited 
we may not be able to obtain the amounts of capital on the terms we seek through issuances of our equity securities  which may cause dilution to current holders of our common shares 

table of contents we are seeking  and expect we will continue to seek  alternative financing arrangements in response to current market conditions  including joint venture and co investment opportunities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop these financing sources on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may need to obtain capital in smaller increments to attempt to match fund any investment we desire to make to the financing source to the extent economically feasible 
our rate of originating new assets may decline under alternative financing arrangements which may result in lower fee income and cash flow for distribution and a reduction in our assets under management 
the failure to secure financing on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts has reduced  and may continue to reduce  our taxable income by limiting our ability to originate loans and other investments and reducing our fee income and increasing our financing expense 
a reduction in our net taxable income could impair our liquidity and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
we cannot assure you that any  or sufficient  funding or capital will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us 
the price of our common shares and other securities historically has been volatile 
this volatility may affect the price at which anyone holding our common shares or other securities could sell them  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or such other securities could adversely affect the price of our common shares or such other securities 
the market price for our common shares has varied between a high of  split adjusted  on february  and a low of on october  in the twelve month period ending on february  this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the common shares 
other securities we have issued have also had volatile market prices 
the market prices of our securities are likely to continue to be volatile and the trading volume subject to significant fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other risk factors discussed in this report  variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
our reliance on significant amounts of debt to finance investments may require us to make significant balloon payments upon maturity  upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise  and an increased risk of loss  may reduce our return on investments  reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders and possibly result in the foreclosure of any assets subject to secured financing 
we have historically incurred a significant amount of debt to finance our investments  which could compound losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
changes in market conditions have caused  and may continue to cause  availability of financing to decrease and the cost of financing to increase relative to the income that we can derive from investments  which has impaired  and may continue to impair  the returns we can achieve and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
our debt service payments reduce the net income available for distributions to our shareholders 
most of our assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings 
in addition  the assets of the securitizations that we consolidate collateralize the debt obligations of the securitizations and are not available to satisfy our other creditors 
to the extent that we fail to meet debt service obligations  we risk the loss of some or all of our respective assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy these debt obligations 
currently  our declaration of trust and bylaws do not impose any limitations on the extent to which we may leverage our respective assets 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flows will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due  or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness 
included in our debt instruments are provisions providing for the lump sum payment of significant amounts of principal  whether upon maturity  upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise  which we refer to as balloon payments 
most of our debt provides for balloon payments that are payable at maturity 
if collateral underlying any secured credit facility we are party to defaults or otherwise fails to meet specified conditions  we may have to repay that facility to the extent it was secured by that 
table of contents collateral 
our ability to make these payments when due will depend upon several factors  which may not be in our control 
these factors include our liquidity or our ability to convert assets owned by us into liquidity on or prior to such put or maturity dates and the amount by which we have been able to reduce indebtedness prior to such put or maturity date though exchanges  refinancing  extensions  collateralization or other similar transactions any of which transactions may also have the effect of reducing liquidity or liquid assets 
our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time  such as the state of the national and regional economies  local real estate conditions  available interest rate levels  the lease terms for and equity in any related collateral  our financial condition and the operating history of the collateral 
if we are unable to pay  redeem  restructure  refinance  extend or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy any of our debt  this could result in defaults under  and acceleration of  our debt and we may be required to sell assets in significant amounts and at times when market conditions are not favorable  which could result in our incurring significant losses 
we may seek to acquire  redeem  restructure  refinance or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy our debt which may include any combination of material payments of cash  issuances of our debt and or equity securities  sales or exchanges of our assets or other methods 
we are aware that our convertible senior notes  collateralized debt obligation  or cdo  notes payable and other indebtedness are currently trading at discounts to their respective face amounts 
in order to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future principal amounts due upon any applicable put dates  at maturity or upon redemption  or to otherwise benefit rait  we may  from time to time  purchase such convertible senior notes  cdo notes payable or other indebtedness for cash  in exchange for our equity or debt securities  or for any combination of cash and our equity or debt securities  in each case in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  exchange offers and consent solicitations or otherwise 
we will evaluate any such transactions in light of then existing market conditions  contractual restrictions and other factors  taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material and may materially reduce our liquidity or reduce or eliminate our ability to convert assets into liquidity 
any material issuances of our equity securities may have a material dilutive effect on our current shareholders 
if our securitizations secured primarily by commercial real estate loans  rait i and rait ii  were to fail to meet their performance tests  including over collateralization requirements  our cash flow would be materially reduced 
the terms of the securitizations we have structured generally provide that the principal amount of assets must exceed the principal balance of the related securities issued by them by a certain amount  commonly referred to as over collateralization 
the securitization terms provide that  if delinquencies and or losses exceed specified levels based on the analysis by the rating agencies or any financial guaranty insurer of the characteristics of the assets collateralizing the securities issued in the securitization  the required level of over collateralization may be increased or may be prevented from decreasing as would otherwise be permitted if losses or delinquencies did not exceed those levels 
in addition  a failure by a securitization to satisfy an over collateralization test typically results in accelerated distributions to the holders of the senior debt securities issued by the securitization entity 
our equity holdings and  when we acquire debt interests in securitizations  our debt interests  and our subordinated management fees  if any  are subordinate in right of payment to the other classes of debt securities issued by the securitization entity 
other tests based on delinquency levels or other criteria may restrict our ability to receive cash distributions from assets collateralizing the securities issued by the securitization entity or our ability to effectively manage the assets held in the securitizations 
we cannot assure you that any performance test will be satisfied 
we currently receive a substantial portion of our cash flow from rait i and rait ii through our retained interests in these securitizations and management fees paid to us for managing these securitizations 
if either or both of these securitizations were to fail to meet their respective over collateralization or other tests  our cash flow would be materially reduced 

table of contents the reinvestment period for rait i has expired and the reinvestment period for rait ii will expire in rait i and rait ii each included reinvestment periods that allowed us to reinvest principal repayments from collateral in eligible investments 
the reinvestment period for rait i ended in november and the reinvestment period for rait ii will end in june when these reinvestment periods expire  our ability to finance new assets within these securitizations is significantly reduced 
the failure of securitizations in which we hold retained interests collateralized primarily by investment in debt securities  taberna viii and taberna ix  to meet their performance tests has reduced  and we expect will continue to reduce  the cash flow we receive from these securitizations 
our remaining consolidated securitizations collateralized primarily by investment in debt securities  taberna viii and taberna ix  have not passed some of their over collateralization tests 
as a consequence  distributions to senior debt have been accelerated  resulting in the cessation of distributions on the subordinated debt and equity we hold in these securitizations as well as our subordinated management fees from these securitizations 
this has substantially reduced the cash flow we receive from these securitizations 
because we do not expect these securitizations will meet these tests for the foreseeable future  we expect that our cash flows from these transactions will remain limited to the senior management fees received from them for the foreseeable future 
we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for services we provide as the collateral manager of rait i  rait ii  taberna preferred funding i  ltd  or taberna i  taberna viii and taberna ix 
if a collateral management agreement is terminated or if the securities serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default  the collateral management fees will be reduced or eliminated 
we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for acting as the collateral manager of rait i  rait ii  taberna i  taberna viii and taberna ix 
if all the notes issued by a securitization for which one of our subsidiaries acts as collateral manager are redeemed  or if the collateral management agreement is otherwise terminated  we will no longer receive collateral management fees from that subsidiary with respect to that securitization 
in general  a collateral management agreement may be terminated both with and without cause at the direction of holders of a specified supermajority in principal amount of the notes issued by the securitization 
furthermore  such fees are based on the total amount of collateral held by the securitizations 
if the securities serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default  we will receive lower collateral management fees than expected or the collateral management fees may be eliminated 
in addition  collateral management agreements typically provide that if certain over collateralization tests are failed  the collateral management agreement may be terminated by a vote of the security holders resulting in our loss of management fees from these securitizations 
if any of our securitizations fail to meet over collateralization tests relevant to the securitization s most senior existing debt  an event of default may occur 
upon an event of default  our ability to manage the securitization may be terminated and our ability to attempt to cure any defaults in the securitization would be limited  which would increase the likelihood of a reduction or elimination of cash flow and returns to us in those securitizations for an indefinite time 
our investments in securitizations are exposed to greater uncertainty and risk of loss than investments in higher grade securities in these securitizations 
when we securitize assets such as commercial mortgage loans  mezzanine loans and trups  the various tranches of investment grade and non investment grade debt obligations and equity securities have differing priorities and rights to the cash flows of the underlying assets being securitized 
we structured our securitization transactions to enable us to place debt and equity securities with investors in the capital markets at various pricing levels based on the credit position created for each tranche of debt and equity securities 
the higher rated 
table of contents debt tranches have priority over the lower rated debt securities and the equity securities issued by the particular securitization entity with respect to payments of interest and principal using the cash flows from the collateral assets 
the relative cost of capital increases as each tranche of capital becomes further subordinated  as does the associated risk of loss if cash flows from the assets are insufficient to repay fully interest and principal or pay dividends 
since we own in many cases the bbb  bb  b and unrated debt and equity classes of securitizations  we are in a first loss position because the rights of the securities that we hold are subordinate in right of payment and in liquidation to the rights of higher rated debt securities issued by the securitization entities 
accordingly  we have incurred and may in the future incur significant losses when investing in these securities 
in the event of default  we may not be able to recover all of our respective investments in these securities 
in addition  we may experience significant losses if the underlying portfolio has been overvalued or if the values subsequently decline and  as a result  less collateral is available to satisfy interest  principal and dividend payments due on the related securities 
the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than higher rated investments  but are more sensitive to economic downturns or developments specific to a particular issuer 
current credit market conditions have caused a decline in the price of lower credit quality securities because the ability of obligors on the underlying assets to make principal  interest and dividend payments may be impaired 
in addition  existing credit support in a number of the securitizations in which we have invested have been  and may in the future be  insufficient to protect us against loss of our investments in these securities 
a number of the securitizations in which we have invested have suffered events of default or other events resulting in the termination for the foreseeable future of any distributions on the subordinated securities we hold 
representations and warranties made by us in loan sales and securitizations may subject us to liability that could result in loan losses and could harm our operating results and  therefore distributions we make to our shareholders 
in connection with securitizations  we make representations and warranties regarding the assets transferred into securitization trusts 
the trustee in the securitizations has recourse to us with respect to the breach of these representations and warranties 
while we generally have recourse to loan originators for any such breaches  the originators may not be able to honor their obligations 
we generally attempt to limit the potential remedies of the trustee to the potential remedies we have against the originators from whom we acquired the assets 
however  in some cases  the remedies available to the trustee may be broader than those available to us against the originators of the assets and  in the event the trustee enforces its remedies against us  we may not always be able to enforce whatever remedies are available to us against the originators of the loans 
furthermore  if we discover  prior to the securitization of an asset  that there is any fraud or misrepresentation with respect to it and the originator fails to repurchase the asset  then we may not be able to sell the asset or may have to sell it at a discount 
our financing arrangements contain covenants that restrict our operations  and any default under these arrangements would inhibit our ability to grow our business  increase revenue and pay distributions to our shareholders 
our financing arrangements contain restrictions  covenants and events of default 
failure to meet or satisfy any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements 
these agreements may contain cross default provisions so that an event of default under one agreement will trigger an event of default under other agreements 
defaults generally give our lenders the right to declare all amounts outstanding under their particular credit agreement to be immediately due and payable  and enforce their rights by foreclosing on or otherwise liquidating collateral pledged under these agreements 
these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities 
furthermore  our default under any of our financing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive market which may harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
historically  we have been subject to significant competition in all of our business lines 
we compete with many third parties engaged in finance and real estate investment activities  including other reits  specialty finance companies  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  institutional investors  investment banking firms and broker dealers  property managers  investment advisors  lenders  governmental bodies and other entities 
with respect to our sponsored companies  we compete with other sponsors of offerings by commercial real estate businesses for access to debt and equity capital 
some of these competitors have  or in the future may have  substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk 
as such  they have the ability to make larger loans and to reduce the risk of loss from any one loan by having a more diversified loan portfolio 
they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from  among other things  a lower cost of  and greater access to  capital and enhanced operating efficiencies 
an increase in the general availability of funds to lenders  or a decrease in the amount of borrowing activity  may increase competition for making loans and may reduce obtainable yields or increase the credit risk inherent in the available loans 
competition may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us 
it may also result in higher prices  lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs  making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms and reducing the fee income we realize from the origination  structuring and management of securitizations 
it may also make it more difficult to obtain appreciation interests and increase the price  and thus reduce potential yields  on discounted loans we acquire 
with respect to our sponsored companies  competition may make it harder for our sponsored companies to raise capital 
we face significant competition in our investments in real estate from other owners  operators and developers of properties  many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate 
such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and reduce the rents we are able to charge 
these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties  which may result in their owners being willing to rent space at lower rental rates than we would or providing greater tenant improvement allowances or other leasing concessions 
this combination of circumstances could adversely affect our revenues and financial performance 
loss of our management team or the ability to attract and retain key employees could harm our business 
the real estate finance business is very labor intensive 
we depend on our management team to manage our investments and attract customers for financing by  among other things  developing relationships with issuers  financial institutions and others 
the market for skilled personnel is highly competitive and has historically experienced a high rate of turnover 
due to the nature of our business  we compete for qualified personnel not only with companies in our business  but also in other sectors of the financial services industry 
competition for qualified personnel may lead to increased hiring and retention costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs or at all 
if we are unable to attract or retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel at manageable costs  it could impair our ability to manage our investments and execute our investment strategies successfully  thereby reducing our earnings 
our board of trustees may change our policies without shareholder consent 
our board of trustees determines our policies and  in particular  our investment policies 
our board of trustees may amend our policies or approve transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of or notice to our shareholders 
policy changes could adversely affect the market price of our shares and our ability to make distributions 
our board of trustees cannot take any action to disqualify us as a reit or to otherwise revoke our election to be taxed as a reit without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting shares 

table of contents our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of business  and we may enter into new businesses  make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures  each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
our organizational documents do not limit us to our current business lines 
accordingly  we may pursue growth through strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures  which may include entering into new lines of business 
in addition  we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other companies  including reits  managers of investment products or originators of real estate debt 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions  enter into joint ventures  or enter into a new line of business  we will face numerous risks and uncertainties  including risks associated with the required investment of capital and other resources  the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk  combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements including those required under the internal revenue code and the investment company act 
entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar  or from which we are currently exempt  and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk 
if a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in the case of joint ventures  we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputation damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
we engage in transactions with related parties and our policies and procedures regarding these transactions may be insufficient to address any conflicts of interest that may arise 
under our code of business conduct  we have established procedures regarding the review  approval and ratification of transactions which may give rise to a conflict of interest between us and any employee  officer  trustee  their immediate family members  other businesses under their control and other related persons 
in the ordinary course of our business operations  we have ongoing relationships and have engaged in transactions with several related entities 
these procedures may not be sufficient to address any conflicts of interest that may arise 
our transactions with  and investments in  certain securitization vehicles may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
we have engaged in transactions with  and invested in  certain of the securitization vehicles under which we also serve as collateral manager  and may do so in the future 
these transactions have included  and may include in the future  surrendering for cancellation notes we hold issued by these vehicles and exchanges of our or others securities with these vehicles for assets collateralizing these vehicles 
in addition  we have previously  and may in the future  purchase investments in these vehicles that are senior or junior to  or have rights and interests different from or adverse to  other investors or credit support providers in the debt or other securities of such securitization vehicles 
such situations may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest between us and such other investors or credit support providers for such investors 
our interests in such transactions and investments may conflict with the interests of such other investors or credit support providers at the time of origination or in the event of a default or restructuring of a securitization vehicle or underlying assets 
furthermore  if we are involved in structuring the securitization vehicles or such securitization vehicles are structured as our subsidiaries  then our managers may have conflicts between us and other entities managed by them that purchase debt or other securities in such securitization vehicles with regard to setting subordination levels  determining interest rates  pricing the securities  providing for divesting or deferring distributions that would otherwise be made to equity interests  or otherwise setting the amounts and priorities of distributions to the holders of debt and equity interests in the securitization vehicles 

table of contents although we seek to make decisions with respect to our securitization vehicles in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these vehicles  perceived or actual conflicts may create dissatisfaction among the other investors in such vehicles or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and our reputation could be damaged if we fail to deal appropriately with one or more perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
regulatory scrutiny of  or litigation in connection with  such conflicts of interest could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles 
the organization and management of our sponsored reits or any other investment vehicles we may manage may create conflicts of interest 
we are sponsoring the initial public offerings of two companies we intend to become non traded reits  irt and imt 
we refer to irt and imt as our sponsored reits 
we expect the sponsored reits will be managed by us and will not be listed on a major exchange 
we may in the future sponsor and or manage other reits and other third party funds or other investment vehicles 
the sponsored reits  along with any new investment vehicles we may manage  will hold assets that we determine should be acquired by them and doing so may create conflicts of interest  including between investors in any sponsored reit and any new investment vehicles and our shareholders  since many investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for one or more of the sponsored reits and other investment vehicles 
additionally  our management and other real estate and debt finance professionals may face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among rait and the sponsored reits and any new investment vehicles 
although as a company we will seek to make these decisions in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these investment vehicles  the transfer or allocation of these assets may give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest 
regulatory scrutiny of  or litigation in connection with  conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles 
our ability to raise capital and attract investors in our sponsored reits is critical to their respective success and ability to grow and depends on our ability to attract a sales force in our subsidiary  independence securities  our affiliated licensed broker dealer responsible for such capital raising 
the sponsored reits will depend upon our ability to attract purchasers of equity interests  which will depend largely upon the efforts of the sales force in independence securities  our affiliated licensed broker dealer responsible for such capital raising 
our ability to grow our sponsored reits will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our sales force and other key personnel and to strategically recruit  retain and compensate new personnel 
however  we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit  retain and motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive 
if we do not retain an effective sales force  or our sales professionals join competitors or form competing companies  it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities  which would have a material adverse impact on our sponsored reits and any benefits we may obtain from our sponsored reits 
we are exposed to loss if lenders under our repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other short term lenders liquidate our portfolio 
moreover  assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other short term debt may not be suitable for refinancing though future securitization transactions  which may require us to seek more costly financing for these assets or to liquidate assets 
we have entered into repurchase agreements  and may in the future enter into other repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other debt with similar terms 
our lenders have the right under the our current repurchase agreement  and may have the right under such other debt  to liquidate assets acquired thereunder upon the 
table of contents occurrence of certain events  such as an event of default 
we are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the lender upon any such liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender 
we are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to such repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other debt with similar terms might not be suitable for refinancing though future securitization transactions 
if we were unable to refinance these assets though future securitization transactions  we might be required to seek more costly financing for theses assets or to liquidate assets 
we will lose money on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term  or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of the term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement 
when we engage in a repurchase transaction  we generally sell securities to the transaction counterparty and receive cash from the counterparty 
the counterparty must resell the securities back to us at the end of the term of the transaction 
because the cash we receive from the counterparty when we initially sell the securities to the counterparty is less than the market value of those securities  if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to resell the securities back to us we will incur a loss on the transaction 
we will also incur a loss if the value of the underlying securities has declined as of the end of the transaction term  as we will have to repurchase the securities for their initial value but would receive securities worth less than that amount 
any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could reduce our earnings  and thus our cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
our financing of our reit qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
we have entered into and intend to enter into  sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell certain reit qualifying assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets 
we believe that we will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owners of the assets that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that we may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement 
it is possible  however  that the internal revenue service  or irs  could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement  in which case our ability to qualify as a reit would be adversely affected 
if any of our reit qualifying assets are subject to a repurchase agreement and are sold by the counterparty in connection with a margin call  the loss of those assets could impair our ability to qualify as a reit 
accordingly  unlike other reits  we may be subject to additional risk regarding our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit 
if we deconsolidate any of rait i  rait ii  taberna viii or taberna ix or our sponsored companies  it may have a material effect on our financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our majority owned and or controlled subsidiaries and of entities that are variable interest entities  or vies  where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation 
if we were to cease serving as the collateral manager for any of rait i  rait ii  taberna viii or taberna ix and or if we determined that our retained interests in any such securitizations no longer made us its primary beneficiary that could affect our determination to consolidate such securitization 
if we deconsolidate any of these securitizations for these or any other reasons  such deconsolidation would have a material effect on our financial statements  including a material reduction of our assets  liabilities  equity and income 
similarly  we expect that the securities offerings we are sponsoring for our sponsored companies will result in our holding minority interests in the sponsored companies 
if we held minority interests  if we were to cease serving as the advisor for any sponsored company for any reason and or if we determined that our retained interests in any such sponsored company no longer made us its primary beneficiary that could affect our determination to consolidate such sponsored company 
we have 
table of contents contributed a substantial amount of assets to irt and may make similar transfers of our assets to other sponsored companies in the future and irt and these other sponsored companies may acquire other assets and otherwise engage in significant activity while we consolidate them 
if we deconsolidate irt or any sponsored company that engaged in significant activity while we consolidated it for these or any other reasons  such deconsolidation may have a material effect on our financial statements  including a material reduction of our assets  liabilities  equity and income 
quarterly results may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future quarterly performance 
our quarterly operating results could fluctuate  therefore  you should not rely on past quarterly results to be indicative of our performance in future quarters 
factors that could cause quarterly operating results to fluctuate include  among others  variations in our investment origination volume  variations in the timing of repayments of debt financing  variations in the amount of time between our receipt of the proceeds of a securities offering and our investment of those proceeds in loans or real estate  market conditions that result in increased cost of funds  the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets  general economic conditions and other factors referred to elsewhere in this section 
risks related to our investments payment defaults and other credit risks in our investment portfolio have occurred  and may continue to occur  which has caused  and may continue to cause  adverse effects on our cash flow  net income and ability to make distributions 
adverse developments in the credit markets have led to business contraction  liquidity issues and other problems for many of the companies we finance 
as a result  payment defaults and other credit risks in our investment portfolio have occurred  and may continue to occur 
to the extent such payment defaults and other credit risks occur  our cash flow  net income and ability to make distributions may be reduced 
our portfolio of trups has been adversely affected by  and may continue to be adversely affected by  economic developments affecting the business sectors in which our borrowers operate  including homebuilders  residential mortgage providers  commercial mortgage providers  office  specialty finance  retail  hospitality and storage  resulting in a substantial reduction in their fair value which adversely affects our financial performance and a substantial decrease in the cash flow we receive from the securitizations holding trups 
we cannot assure you that the fair value we reflect for any asset or liability in any particular reporting period will not change adversely in a subsequent reporting period 
we may need to increase our loan loss reserves against our portfolios of commercial real estate investments due to general business and economic conditions and increased credit and liquidity risks which would reduce our earnings 
our portfolio of commercial real estate investments has been adversely affected by  and may continue to be adversely affected by  economic developments affecting the business sectors in which our borrowers operate  including multi family  office  and retail  including reductions in the value of commercial real estate generally and the reduced availability of refinancing for commercial real estate investments as they mature 
we cannot assure you that the loan loss reserves we adopt in any particular reporting period will be sufficient or will not increase in a subsequent reporting period 
we may not realize gains or income from investments and have realized  and may continue to realize  losses from some of our investments 
we seek to generate both current income and capital appreciation 
however  our investments may not appreciate in value and  in fact  a substantial portion of our investments have declined  and may continue to decline  in value 
in addition  some of the financings that we originated and the loans and securities in which we invest have defaulted  and may continue to be in default on interest and or principal payments 
accordingly  we 
table of contents may not be able to realize gains or income from investments and may realize losses 
any gains that we do realize may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience 
any income that we realize may not be sufficient to offset our respective expenses 
uninsured and underinsured losses may affect the value of  or our return from  our real estate 
our properties  and the properties underlying our loans  have comprehensive insurance in amounts we believe are sufficient to permit the replacement of the properties in the event of a total loss  subject to applicable deductibles 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as earthquakes  floods  hurricanes and terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
also  inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property 
if any of these or similar events occurs  it may reduce our return from an affected property and the value of our investment 
real estate with environmental problems may create liability for us 
the existence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property will adversely affect its value and our ability to sell or borrow against the property 
contamination of real estate by hazardous substances or toxic wastes not only may give rise to a lien on that property to assure payment of the cost of remediation  but also can result in liability to us as owner  operator or lender for that cost 
many environmental laws can impose liability whether we know of  or are responsible for  the contamination 
in addition  if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site  we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site  even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses  and may materially limit our use of our properties and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  future or amended laws  or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing environmental requirements  may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
our investment portfolio may have material geographic  sector  property type and sponsor concentrations 
we may have material geographic concentrations related to our investments in commercial real estate loans and properties 
the reits and real estate operating companies in whose securities we invest in may also have material geographic concentrations related to their investments in real estate  loans secured by real estate or other investments 
we also have material concentrations in the property types that comprise our commercial loan portfolio and in the industry sectors that comprise our unsecured securities portfolio 
we also have material concentrations in the sponsors of properties that comprise our commercial loan portfolio 
where we have any kind of concentration risk in our investments  an adverse development in that area of concentration could reduce the value of our investment and our return on that investment and  if the concentration affects a material amount of our investments  impair our ability to execute our investment strategies successfully  reduce our earnings and reduce our ability to make distributions 
our due diligence efforts before making an investment may not identify all the risks related to that investment 
before originating a loan or investment for  or making a loan to or investment in  an entity  we will assess the strength and skills of the entity s management and other factors that we believe will determine the success of the loan or investment 
in making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence  we expect to rely on available resources and  in some cases  an investigation by third parties 
this process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the due diligence processes we conduct will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful 

table of contents our investments are relatively illiquid which may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and any sales may be at a loss to us 
our commercial real estate loans and our investments in real estate are relatively illiquid investments and we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions or dispose of these assets quickly or at all in the event we need additional liquidity 
we make and hold investments in securities issued by private companies and other illiquid investments 
a portion of these investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities 
the illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and may impair the value of these investments 
any sales of investments we make may result in our recognizing a loss on the sale 
our subordinated real estate investments such as mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate involve increased risk of loss 
we invest in mezzanine loans and other forms of subordinated financing  such as investments consisting of preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate 
because of their subordinate position  these subordinated investments carry a greater credit risk than senior lien financing  including a substantially greater risk of non payment 
if a borrower defaults on our subordinated investment or on debt senior to us  our subordinated investment will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid off  which may result in our being unable to recover the full amount  or any  of our investment 
a decline in the real estate market could adversely affect the value of the property so that the aggregate outstanding balances of senior liens may exceed the value of the underlying property 
where debt senior to our investment exists  the presence of inter creditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents  assign our loans  accept prepayments  exercise our remedies through standstill periods and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase the time needed for us to acquire underlying collateral in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
in the event of a default on a senior loan  we may elect to make payments  if we have the right to do so  in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior loans 
when we originate or acquire a subordinated investment  we may not have the right to service senior loans 
the servicers of the senior loans are responsible to the holders of those loans  whose interests will likely not coincide with ours  particularly in the event of a default 
accordingly  the senior loans may not be serviced in a manner advantageous to us 
it is also possible that  in some cases  a due on sale clause included in a senior mortgage  which accelerates the amount due under the senior mortgage in case of the sale of the property  may apply to the sale of the property if we foreclose  increasing our risk of loss 
we have loans that are not collateralized by recorded or perfected liens on the real estate underlying our loans 
some of the loans not collateralized by liens are secured instead by deeds in lieu of foreclosure  also known as pocket deeds 
a deed in lieu of foreclosure is a deed executed in blank that the holder is entitled to record immediately upon a default in the loan 
loans that are not collateralized by recorded or perfected liens are subordinate not only to existing liens encumbering the underlying property  but also to future judgments or other liens that may arise as well as to the claims of general creditors of the borrower 
moreover  filing a deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to these loans will usually constitute an event of default under any related senior debt 
any such default would require us to assume or pay off the senior debt in order to protect our investment 
furthermore  in a borrower s bankruptcy  we will have materially fewer rights than secured creditors and  if our loan is secured by equity interests in the borrower  fewer rights than the borrower s general creditors 
our rights also will be subordinate to the lien like rights of the bankruptcy trustee 
moreover  enforcement of our loans against the underlying properties will involve a longer  more complex  and likely  more expensive legal process than enforcement of a mortgage loan 
in addition  we may lose lien priority in many jurisdictions  to persons who supply labor and materials to a property 
for these and other reasons  the total amount that we may recover from one of our investments may be less than the total amount of that investment or our cost of an acquisition of an investment 

table of contents acquisitions of loans may involve increased risk of loss 
when we acquire existing loans  they are subject to general risks described in this section 
when we acquire loans at a discount from both the outstanding balances of the loans and the appraised value of the properties underlying the loans  the loans typically are in default under the original loan terms or other requirements and are subject to forbearance agreements 
a forbearance agreement typically requires a borrower to pay to the lender all revenue from a property after payment of the property s operating expenses in return for the lender s agreement to withhold exercising its rights under the loan documents 
acquiring loans at a discount involves a substantially higher degree of risk of non collection than loans that conform to institutional underwriting criteria 
we do not acquire a loan unless material steps have been taken toward resolving problems with the loan  or its underlying property 
financing with high loan to value ratios may involve increased risk of loss 
a loan to value ratio is the ratio of the amount of our financing  plus the amount of any senior indebtedness  to the appraised value of the property underlying the loan 
we expect to continue to hold loans with high loan to value ratios 
by reducing the margin available to cover fluctuations in property value  a high loan to value ratio increases the risk that  upon default  the amount obtainable from the sale of the underlying property may be insufficient to repay the financing 
preferred equity investments in reits and real estate operating companies may involve a greater risk of loss than traditional debt financing and specific risks relating to particular issuers 
we have invested  and may continue to invest in preferred securities  other than trups  of reits and real estate operating companies  depending upon our ability to finance such assets directly or indirectly in accordance with our financing strategy 
preferred equity investments involve a higher degree of risk than traditional debt financing due to a variety of factors  including that such investments are subordinate to debt and are not secured by property underlying the investment 
furthermore  should an issuer of preferred equity default on our investment  we would only be able to proceed against the issuer  and not the property owned by the issuer 
in most cases  a preferred equity holder has no recourse against an issuer for a failure to pay stated dividends  rather  unpaid dividends typically accrue and the preferred shareholder maintains a liquidation preference in the event of a liquidation of the issuer of the preferred securities 
an issuer may not have sufficient assets to satisfy any liquidation preference to which we may be entitled 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investments in preferred equity securities 
the commercial mortgage loans in which we invest and the commercial mortgage loans underlying the cmbs in which we invest are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us that may result in reduced earnings or losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
we hold substantial portfolios of commercial mortgage loans and cmbs which are secured by multi family or other commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure 
the ability of a borrower to repay a non recourse loan secured by an income producing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if the net operating income of the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by  among other things tenant mix  success of tenant businesses  property management decisions  property location and condition  competition from comparable types of properties  changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged  any need to address environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions and or specific industry segments  declines in regional or local real estate values  declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates  increases in interest rates  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation  acts of god  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 

table of contents in the event of any default under a commercial mortgage loan held directly by us  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a commercial mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court  and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a commercial mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
cmbs evidence interests in or are secured by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans 
accordingly  the mortgage backed securities in which we invest are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans 
if we are unable to improve the performance of commercial real estate properties we take control of in connection with restructurings  workouts and foreclosures of investments  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
we have taken control of an increasing number of the properties underlying our commercial real estate investments in connection with restructurings  workouts and foreclosures of these investments 
if we are unable to improve the performance of these properties from their performance under their prior owners  our cash flow may be adversely affected if the properties cash flow is insufficient to support payments due on any related debt 
any properties we consolidate may be required to be reflected at lower values on our financial statements 
we may need to make significant capital improvements to our properties in order to remain competitive 
our investments in real estate may face competition from newer  more updated properties 
in order to remain competitive  we may need to make significant capital improvements to these properties 
in addition  in the event we need to re lease a property  we may need to make significant tenant improvements  all of which will reduce our cash flow 
lease expirations  lease defaults and lease terminations may adversely affect our revenue 
lease expirations  lease defaults and lease terminations may result in reduced revenue from our real estate if the lease payments received from replacement tenants are less than the lease payments received from the expiring  defaulting or terminating tenants 
in addition  lease defaults by one or more significant tenants  lease terminations by tenants following events causing significant damage to the property or takings by eminent domain  or the failure of tenants under expiring leases to elect to renew their leases  could cause us to experience long periods with reduced or no revenue from a property and to incur substantial capital expenditures in order to obtain replacement tenants 
see item properties  for a ten year lease expiration schedule for our non residential properties as of december  risks relating to the fair value of our assets and liabilities a decline in the market value of our assets we finance pursuant to repurchase agreements or warehouse facilities may result in margin calls that may force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions 
our current repurchase agreements allow  and we expect any warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements we enter into in the future to allow  our lender to make margin calls that would require us to make cash payments or deliver additional assets to our lender in the event that there is a decline in the market value of the assets that collateralize our repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or similar debt or for other reasons 
as a result  a decline in the market value of assets collateralizing any such debt may result in our lenders initiating margin calls and requiring a pledge of additional collateral or cash 
posting additional collateral or cash to support our borrowings would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets  which could 
table of contents adversely affect our business 
as a result  we could be forced to sell some of our assets in order to maintain liquidity 
forced sales typically result in lower sales prices than do market sales made in the normal course of business 
if our investments were liquidated at prices below the amortized cost basis of such investments  we would incur losses  which could result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition 
a portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our management and  as a result  there may be uncertainty as to the value of these investments 
we reflect certain investments in securities  certain cdo notes payable  certain derivative instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet  with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
most of these investments are securities or other assets that are not publicly traded 
the fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable 
for further discussion of the fair value of our financial instruments  see items financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies fair value of financial investments 
we value these investments quarterly at fair value 
because such valuations are inherently uncertain  may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates  our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed 
if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are not realized  we could record a loss upon their disposal 
when we acquire properties through the foreclosure of commercial real estate loans  we may recognize losses if the fair value of the property internally determined upon such acquisition is less than the previous carrying amount of the foreclosed loan 
we periodically acquire properties through the foreclosure of commercial real estate loans 
upon acquisition  we value the real estate property and its related assets and liabilities 
the fair values are determined based primarily upon discounted cash flow or capitalization rate models  the use of which requires critical assumptions including discount rates  capitalization rates  vacancy rates and growth rates based  in part  on the properties operating history and third party data 
we may recognize losses if the fair value of the property internally determined upon acquisition is less than the previous carrying amount of the foreclosed loan 
the fair value of our assets that we record at their fair value under the fair value option may decline  which may have an adverse effect on our financial statements 
the fair value of our investments that we record on our financial statements at their fair value under fasb asc topic  may decline  which may have an adverse effect on our financial statements 
these investments consist primarily of our portfolio of trups and subordinated debentures 
the fair value of our cdo notes payable issued by our consolidated securitizations  taberna viii and taberna ix  has declined more significantly than the fair value of the assets collateralizing those securitizations and  if the fair value of the cdo notes payable increases to approximate that of the underlying assets or if the cdo notes payable are repaid at their par amount  that would materially reduce our earnings and shareholders equity 
through december  the cumulative effect of the fair value adjustments recorded on each financial asset and liability selected for the fair value option resulted in a net increase in shareholders equity of million  principally as a result of adjustments in the fair value of our cdo notes payable and other liabilities 
this increase in shareholders equity may reverse through earnings as an unrealized loss in the future 
for example  in the event our cdo notes payable were to recover some or all of their value sooner than any recovery of the value of the securities collateralizing them  the net difference in the respective recoveries could materially reduce earnings and our shareholders equity 
under current market conditions and the volatility in interest rates and the credit performance of our underlying collateral  we cannot assure you that there will not be further significant fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities  which could materially reduce earnings and our shareholders equity 

table of contents at december   our total investment in taberna viii and taberna ix is approximately million which represents both preferred equity and various levels of debt positions 
approximately of the investments are in the form of trups and trups related receivables issued by commercial real estate companies 
the typical trups instruments are unsecured borrowings with a year maturity and a year no call provision that prevented prepayments 
beginning in  the no call provisions for trups collateralizing taberna viii and taberna ix start to expire and the trups issuers will have the option to prepay these instruments 
given the historically low interest rate environment in comparison to when the collateral was originated years ago  together with improving performance for some of these trups issuers  we expect some of the trups issuers will elect to prepay their trups 
we expect to use any prepayments to repay the most senior tranches of the non recourse cdo notes payable issued by taberna viii and taberna ix in accordance with the terms of their respective indentures 
we carry these cdo notes payable at their fair market value on our financial statements  which is currently lower than the amount due thereunder  and any negative difference between the amount paid and the carrying amount may result in incremental non cash charges to our gaap earnings 
interest rate changes may reduce the value of our investments 
changes in interest rates affect the market value of our investment portfolio 
in general  the market value of a loan will change in inverse relation to an interest rate change where a loan has a fixed interest rate or only limited interest rate adjustments 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  the market value of such a loan will decrease 
moreover  in a period of declining interest rates  real estate loans with rates that are fixed or variable only to a limited extent may have less value than other income producing securities due to possible prepayments 
interest rate changes will also affect the return we obtain on new loans 
in particular  during a period of declining rates  our reinvestment of loan repayments may be at lower rates than we obtained in prior investments or on the repaid loans 
also  increases in interest rates on debt we incur may not be reflected in increased rates of return on the investments funded through such debt  which would reduce our return on those investments 
accordingly  interest rate changes may materially affect the total return on our investment portfolio  which in turn will affect the amount available for distribution to shareholders 
the value of our investments depends on conditions beyond our control 
our investments include loans secured directly or indirectly by real estate  interests in entities whose principal or sole assets are real estate or direct ownership of real estate 
as a result  the value of these investments depends primarily upon the value of the real estate underlying these investments which is affected by numerous factors beyond our control including general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  weather  casualty losses  occupancy rates and other factors beyond our control 
the value of this underlying real estate may also be affected by factors such as the costs of compliance with use  occupancy and similar regulations  potential or actual liabilities under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
operating and other expenses of this underlying real estate  particularly significant expenses such as mortgage payments  insurance  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  generally do not decrease when income decreases and  even if revenue increases  operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues 
any investment may also be affected by a borrower s failure to comply with the terms of our investment  its bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization or its properties becoming subject to foreclosure proceedings  all of which may require us to become involved in expensive and time consuming litigation 
some of our investments defer some portion of our return to loan maturity or the mandatory redemption date 
the borrower s ability to satisfy these deferred obligations may depend upon its ability to obtain suitable refinancing or to otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash 
these risks may be subject to the same considerations we describe in this risks related to our investments section 

table of contents risks relating to our use of derivatives and hedging instruments our hedging transactions may not insulate us from interest rate risk  which could cause volatility in our earnings 
subject to limits imposed by our desire to maintain our qualification as a reit  we enter into hedging transactions to limit exposure to changes in interest rates 
we are therefore exposed to risks associated with such transactions 
we have entered into  and expect to continue to enter into  interest rate swap agreements 
we may also use instruments such as forward contracts and interest rate caps  currency swaps  collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates 
hedging against a decline in the values of portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline 
however  such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments  thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions 
such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the portfolio positions should increase 
moreover  it may not be possible to hedge against an interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we would not be able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price 
the success of hedging transactions undertaken by us will depend on our ability to structure and execute effective hedges for the assets we hold and  to a degree  on our ability to anticipate interest rate or currency value fluctuations  the expected life of our assets or other factors 
our failure to do so may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in such hedging transactions 
in addition  the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary 
moreover  for a variety of reasons  we may not establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged 
any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss 
changes in fair value can be caused by changes in interest rates that are not fully hedged 
to the extent that we fail to hedge fully against adverse fluctuations in interest rates  our earnings will be reduced or we could have losses 
while we use hedging to mitigate certain risks  our failure to completely insulate the portfolios from those risks may cause greater volatility in our earnings 
hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges  guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house  or regulated by any us or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks of default by the hedging counterparty and illiquidity 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  part of our investment strategy involves entering into puts and calls on securities or indices of securities  interest rate swaps  caps and collars  including options and forward contracts  and interest rate lock agreements  principally treasury lock agreements  to seek to hedge against mismatches between the cash flows from our assets and the interest payments on our liabilities 
hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges  guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house  or regulated by any us or foreign governmental authorities 
consequently  there are no requirements with respect to record keeping  financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions 
furthermore  the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and  depending on the identity of the counterparty  applicable international requirements 
legislation was passed to create a clearing house for hedging instruments and require the posting of cash collateral based on the fair value of any hedging instruments 
while regulatory agencies have not finalized the rules implementing this legislation  we believe that hedging instruments in place prior to this legislation will not be impacted 
the business failure of a counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default 
default by a party with whom we entered into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of 
table of contents unrealized profits and force us to cover our resale commitments  if any  at the then current market price 
although generally we seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions  we may not always be able to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty  and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk 
a liquid secondary market may not exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold  and we may have to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
in july  the us congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act may impose significant requirements on hedging instruments we use 
while the full impact of the dodd frank act cannot be assessed until implementing regulations are adopted  the dodd frank act s requirements may have a significant effect on our use of hedging instruments  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
for example  the regulatory requirements are likely to impose heightened margin requirements for future hedging transactions 
such margin requirements may result from a requirement for financial entities to centrally clear certain derivatives instruments 
we and our affiliates occasionally post margin to secure our and their derivatives transactions at this time  so the impact of such a requirement largely depends on the magnitude of such requirements as set forth in to be finalized regulations 
our ability to enter into hedging transactions at commercially reasonable rates may be limited by developments relating to the counterparties we used historically and economic and credit market conditions generally 
most of the counterparties under our outstanding hedging instruments are affiliates of investment banks that have subsequently been acquired by other financial institutions 
we cannot assure you that as our outstanding hedges reach their termination dates or as we seek to enter into new hedging transactions  that our historical counterparties or other institutions with acceptable credit ratings will enter into hedging transactions with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while most of our hedging instruments have termination dates in or later  we have hedges that will terminate in each year prior to if we cannot enter into interest rate hedges on commercially reasonable terms  our exposure to interest rate risk will increase 
the risk of defaults by our counterparties may increase as the markets for hedging transactions shrink and become more volatile 
we may enter into hedging instruments that could expose us to unexpected losses in the future 
we may enter into hedging instruments that would require us to fund cash payments in the future under certain circumstances  for example  upon the early termination of the instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event  or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the instrument 
the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open positions with the counterparty and could also include other fees and charges 
these losses will be reflected in our financial results of operations  and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time  and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition 
we may enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future 
part of our investment strategy involves entering into derivative contracts like the interest rate swaps we use to limit our exposure to interest rate movements 
most of our derivative contracts require us to fund cash payments upon the early termination of a derivative agreement caused by an event of default or other early termination event 
the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges 
in addition  some of these derivative arrangements require that we maintain specified percentages of cash collateral with the counterparty to fund potential liabilities under the derivative contract 
we may have to make cash payments in order to maintain the required percentage of collateral with the counterparty 
these economic losses would be reflected in our results of operations  and our ability to fund these obligations would depend on the liquidity of our respective assets and 
table of contents access to capital at the time 
the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition 
our due diligence may not reveal all of an entity s liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in the entity s business 
tax risks we and the reit affiliates may fail to qualify as a reit  and such failure to qualify would have significant adverse consequences on the value of our common shares 
in addition  if we fail  or any reit affiliate fails  to qualify as a reit  our respective dividends will not be deductible  and the entity will be subject to corporate level tax on its net taxable income  which would reduce the cash available to make distributions 
we believe that we have been organized and operated in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs that we and the reit affiliates qualify as a reit and any statements in our filings or the filings of the reit affiliates with the sec are not binding on the irs or any court 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions  for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may also affect our abilities and those of the reit affiliates to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  we and the reit affiliates must each satisfy a number of requirements  including requirements regarding the composition of our respective assets and sources of our respective gross income 
also  we must each make distributions to our respective shareholders aggregating annually at least of our respective net taxable incomes  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  our respective ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or limited influence  including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership or reit for us federal income tax purposes 
as an example  to the extent we invest in preferred equity securities of other reit issuers  our qualification as a reit will depend upon the continued qualification of such issuers as reits under the internal revenue code 
accordingly  unlike other reits  we and the reit affiliates may be subject to additional risk regarding our respective ability to qualify and maintain our respective qualification as a reit 
the reduction in our rate of originating new assets  operations and liquidity may adversely impact our and the reit affiliates ability to meet reit requirements and we and the reit affiliates may be less able to make changes to our respective investment portfolios to adjust our respective reit qualifying assets and income depending on our respective ability to deploy capital and maintain assets under management 
there can be no assurance that we and the reit affiliates will be successful in operating in a manner that will allow us to each qualify as a reit 
because we receive significant distributions from taberna  and may in the future receive significant distributions from other of the reit affiliates  the failure of one or more of such reit affiliates to maintain its reit status could cause us to lose our reit status 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors  our respective ability to qualify as a reit or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
if we or any of the reit affiliates fail to qualify as a reit or lose our respective qualification as a reit at any time  we  or such reit affiliate  would face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our respective shareholders for each of the years involved because we  or such reit affiliate  would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our respective shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we  or such reit affiliate  also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless statutory relief provisions apply  we  or such reit affiliate  could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year of disqualification 

table of contents in addition  if we  or such reit affiliate  fail to qualify as a reit  such entity will not be required to make distributions to its shareholders  and all distributions to shareholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit  we and the reit affiliates must each continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income  nature and diversification of assets  amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares 
in order to satisfy these tests  we and the reit affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made 
accordingly  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our and the reit affiliates investment performance 
in particular  at least of our and the reit affiliates total assets at the end of each calendar quarter must each consist of real estate assets  government securities  and cash or cash items 
for this purpose  real estate assets generally include interests in real property  such as land  buildings  leasehold interests in real property  stock of other entities that qualify as reits  interests in mortgage loans secured by real property  investments in stock or debt instruments during the one year period following the receipt of new capital and regular or residual interests in a real estate mortgage investment conduit  or remic 
in addition  the amount of securities of a single issuer that we and each of the reit affiliates hold must generally not exceed either of the value of such issuer s gross assets or of the vote or value of such issuer s outstanding securities 
certain of the assets that we or the reit affiliates hold or intend to hold  including trups and unsecured loans to reits or other entities  will not be qualified real estate assets for the purposes of the reit asset tests 
in addition  although preferred equity securities of reits which would not include trups should generally be treated as qualified real estate assets  this will require that i they are treated as equity for us tax purposes  and ii their issuers maintain their qualification as reits 
cmbs should generally qualify as real estate assets 
however  to the extent that we or the reit affiliates own non remic collateralized mortgage obligations or other debt instruments secured by mortgage loans rather than by real property or secured by non real estate assets  or debt securities issued by corporations that are not secured by mortgages on real property  those securities will likely not be qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests 
we and the reit affiliates generally will be treated as the owner of any assets that collateralize a securitization transaction to the extent that we or such affiliates retain all of the equity of the securitization entity and do not make an election to treat such securitization entity as a trs  as described in further detail below 
as noted above  in order to comply with the reit asset tests and gross income test  at least of each of our respective total assets and of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets  whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our respective best investment alternative 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  but including any mortgage loans  held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities  and therefore may limit our respective ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets 
it may be possible to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests by conducting certain activities  holding non qualifying reit assets or engaging in securitization transactions through our trss  subject to certain limitations as described below 
to the extent that we and the reit affiliates engage in such activities through trss  the income associated with such activities may be subject to full us federal corporate income tax 

table of contents neither trups nor equity in corporate entities  such as issuers of securitizations that hold trups  will qualify as real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and the income generated by such investments generally will not qualify as real estate related income for the reit gross income tests 
we and taberna must continue to invest in qualifying real estate assets  such as mortgage loans and debt securities secured by real estate  to maintain its reit qualification  and these assets typically generate less attractive returns than trups which could result in reduced returns to taberna  and therefore to our shareholders 
neither trups nor equity in corporate entities  such as issuers of securitizations  that hold trups will qualify as real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests that taberna must meet on a quarterly basis to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the income received from taberna s investments in trups or in corporate entities holding trups generally will not qualify as real estate related income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
if taberna fails to make sufficient investments in qualifying real estate assets  taberna will likely fail to maintain its reit qualification  which could cause taberna to be subject to significant taxes and rait to fail to maintain its reit qualification and be subject to significant taxes 
reit qualifying investments typically are lower yielding than taberna s expected returns on trups 
accordingly  maintaining sufficient amounts of reit qualifying investments could result in reduced returns to taberna  and therefore to our shareholders 
furthermore  if income inclusions from taberna s foreign trss which are securitizations  taberna viii and taberna ix  are determined not to qualify for the reit gross income test  taberna could fail to qualify as a reit  or even if it did not fail to qualify as a reit  taberna could be subject to a penalty tax 
in addition  taberna would need to invest in sufficient qualifying assets  or sell some of its interests in taberna viii and taberna ix to ensure that the income recognized by taberna from taberna viii and taberna ix does not exceed of taberna s gross income 
see we or taberna may lose our or its reit qualification or be subject to a penalty tax if the internal revenue service  or irs  successfully challenges our or its characterization of income from taberna viii and taberna ix 
any reduction in taberna s net taxable income would have an adverse effect on its liquidity  and its ability to pay distributions to us 
each of our and the reit affiliates qualifications as a reit and exemption from us federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the issuers of the reit securities in which we invest maintaining their reit qualification and the accuracy of legal opinions rendered to or statements made by the issuers of securities  including securitizations  in which we invest 
when purchasing securities issued by reits  we and the reit affiliates may each rely on opinions of counsel for the issuer of such securities  or statements made in related offering documents  for purposes of determining whether such issuer qualifies as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for us federal income tax purposes  and therefore to what extent those securities constitute reit real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and produce income which qualifies under the reit gross income test 
in addition  when purchasing securitization equity  we and the reit affiliates may each rely on opinions of counsel regarding the qualification of the securitization for exemption from us corporate income tax 
the inaccuracy of any such opinions or statements may adversely affect our or the reit affiliates respective reit qualification and or result in significant corporate level tax 
in addition  if the issuer of any reit equity securities in which we or the reit affiliates invest were to fail to maintain its qualification as a reit  the securities of such issuer held by us or such affiliate will fail to qualify as real estate assets for purposes of maintaining reit qualification and the income generated by such securities will not represent qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income test and therefore could cause us or such affiliate to fail to qualify as a reit 
we or taberna may lose our or its reit qualification or be subject to a penalty tax if the internal revenue service  or irs  successfully challenges our or its characterization of income from taberna viii and taberna ix 
we and taberna are required to include in income  in certain cases  even without the receipt of actual distributions  earnings from foreign trss that are securitizations  taberna viii and taberna ix  or other foreign corporations that are not qualified reit subsidiaries 
taberna treats  and we intend to treat  certain of these 
table of contents income inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test applicable to reits but not for purposes of the reit gross income test 
the provisions that set forth what income is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test provide that gross income derived from dividends  interest and certain other classes of passive income qualify for purposes of the gross income test 
income inclusions from equity investments in taberna viii and taberna ix are technically neither dividends nor any of the other enumerated categories of income specified in the gross income test for us federal income tax purposes  and there is no clear precedent with respect to the qualification of such income 
however  based on advice of counsel  we and taberna intend to treat such inclusions  to the extent distributed by taberna viii and taberna ix in the year it was accrued  as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
in  the irs issued a private letter ruling considering situations in which a reit had to include income from foreign corporations 
the irs ruled that such income would qualify for the gross income test 
since private letter rulings only protect the recipient of the letter  it is still possible that  because this income does not meet the literal requirements of the reit provisions  the irs might take the position that such income is not qualifying income 
in the event that such income was determined not to qualify for the gross income test  we or taberna could fail to qualify as a reit 
even if such income does not cause us or taberna to fail to qualify as a reit because of certain relief provisions  we or taberna would be subject to a penalty tax with respect to such income because such income  together with other non qualifying income earned by us or taberna  has exceeded and will exceed of its gross income 
this penalty tax  if applicable  would be calculated by multiplying the amount by which our or taberna s non qualifying income exceeds of our or taberna s total gross income by a fraction intended to reflect our or taberna s profitability 
in addition  if such income were determined not to qualify for the gross income test  we or taberna would need to invest in sufficient qualifying assets  or sell some interests in taberna viii and taberna ix or other foreign corporations that are not qualified reit subsidiaries to ensure that the income recognized by us or taberna from taberna viii and taberna ix or such other foreign corporations does not exceed of our or taberna s gross income 
we have federal and state tax obligations 
even if we qualify as reits for us federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay us federal  state and local taxes on income and property 
in addition  our domestic trss are fully taxable corporations that will be subject to taxes on their income  and they may be limited in their ability to deduct interest payments made to us 
we also will be subject to a penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among us and trss are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
we may be taxable at the highest corporate income tax rate on a portion of the income arising from a taxable mortgage pool that is allocable to shares held by disqualified organizations 
in addition  under certain circumstances we could be subject to a penalty tax for failure to meet certain reit requirements but nonetheless maintains its qualification as a reit 
for example  we may be required to pay a penalty tax with respect to income earned in connection with securitization equity in the event such income is determined not to be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income test but we are otherwise able to remain qualified as a reit 
to the extent that we or the trss are required to pay us federal  state or local taxes  we will have less to distribute to shareholders 
failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax  which would reduce the ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
in order to qualify as a reit  we and the reit affiliates must each distribute to our respective shareholders each calendar year at least of our respective reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain 
to the extent that we and the reit affiliates each satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of net taxable income  we or such affiliate will be subject to us federal corporate income tax 
in addition  we or the reit affiliates will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our respective distributions in any calendar year are less than the sum of of ordinary income for that year  
table of contents of capital gain net income for that year  and undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we and the reit affiliates each intend to distribute our respective net income to our respective shareholders in a manner intended to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid both corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
there is no requirement that any trs of ours or the reit affiliates distribute their after tax net income to us or the reit affiliates and such trss may  to the extent consistent with maintaining our or the reit affiliates qualification as a reit  determine not to make any current distributions to us or the reit affiliates 
however  taberna s non us trss  taberna viii and taberna ix  will generally be deemed to distribute their earnings to taberna on an annual basis for us federal income tax purposes  regardless of whether such trss actually distribute their earnings 
our or the reit affiliates respective taxable income may substantially exceed our or their respective net income as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  because  for example  expected capital losses will be deducted in determining our respective gaap net income  but may not be deductible in computing our or their respective taxable income 
gaap net income may also be reduced to the extent we or the reit affiliates have to markdown the value of our respective assets to reflect their current value 
prior to the sale of such assets  those mark downs do not comparably reduce taxable income 
in addition  we or the reit affiliates may invest in assets including the equity of securitization entities that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets 
this taxable income may arise for us in the following ways repurchase of our debt at a discount  including our convertible senior notes or cdo notes payable  will generally result in our recognizing reit taxable income in the form of cancellation of indebtedness income generally equal to the amount of the discount 
recent legislation permits the deferral of taxes coming about through debt buybacks at a discount in certain circumstances 
origination of loans with appreciation interests may be deemed to have original issue discount for federal income tax purposes 
original issue discount is generally equal to the difference between an obligation s issue price and its stated redemption price at maturity 
this discount must be recognized as income over the life of the loan even though the corresponding cash will not be received until maturity 
our or the reit affiliates loan terms may provide for both an interest pay rate and accrual rate 
when this occurs  we recognize interest based on the sum of the pay rate and the accrual rate  but only receive cash at the pay rate until maturity of the loan  at which time all accrued interest is due and payable 
our or the reit affiliates loans or unconsolidated real estate may contain provisions whereby the benefit of any principal amortization of the underlying senior debt inures to us or the reit affiliates 
we or the reit affiliates recognize this benefit as income as the amortization occurs  with no related cash receipts until repayment of our loan 
sales or other dispositions of investments in real estate  as well as significant modifications to loan terms may result in timing differences between income recognition and cash receipts 
although some types of taxable income are excluded to the extent they exceed of our net income in determining the distribution requirement  we will incur corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax with respect to any taxable income items if we do not distribute those items on an annual basis 
as a result of the foregoing  we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year 
in that event  we may be required to use cash reserves  incur debt  or liquidate non cash assets at rates or times that we or it regard as unfavorable in order to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the deductible excise tax in that year 

table of contents if our or taberna s securitizations are subject to us federal income tax at the entity level  it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to distribute to us or taberna and pay their creditors 
taberna s consolidated foreign securitization subsidiaries  taberna viii and taberna ix  are organized as cayman islands companies  and we may own similar foreign securitization s in the future 
there is a specific exemption from us federal income tax for us corporations that restrict their activities in the united states to trading stock and securities or any activity closely related thereto for their own account whether such trading or such other activity is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker  commission agent  custodian or other agent 
we and taberna intend that the consolidated securitization subsidiaries and any other non us securitizations that are trss will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to us federal income tax on their net income at the entity level 
if the irs were to succeed in challenging the tax treatment of our or taberna s securitizations  it could greatly reduce the amount that those securitizations would have available to distribute to their shareholders and to pay to their creditors 
any reduced distributions would reduce amounts available for distribution to our shareholders 
our and the reit affiliates ownership of and relationship with trss will be limited  and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our and its reit qualification and may result in the application of a excise tax 
a reit may own up to of the stock of one or more trss 
a trs may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a reit 
both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs 
a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs 
overall  no more than for taxable years prior to of the value of a reit s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss 
in addition  the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
the rules also impose a excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
any domestic trss that we or the reit affiliates own or that we or the reit affiliates acquire in the future will pay us federal  state and local income tax on their taxable income  and their after tax net income will be available for distribution but will not be required to be distributed 
the value of the securities that we or the reit affiliates hold in trss may not be subject to precise valuation 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we or the reit affiliates will be able to comply with the limitation discussed above or avoid application of the excise tax discussed above 
compliance with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code limit our ability to hedge mortgage backed securities  preferred securities and related borrowings 
except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the us treasury department  or the treasury regulations  any income from a hedging transaction we enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made  or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred  to acquire or carry real estate assets  which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired  originated  or entered into  including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction  will not constitute gross income for purposes of the gross income test and will generally constitute non qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions  the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests 
as a result  we might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through trss 
this could increase the cost of our hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear 

table of contents we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common shares 
at any time  the us federal income tax laws or regulations governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended 
we cannot predict when or if any new us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  or any amendment to any existing us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  will be adopted  promulgated or become effective and any such law  regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively 
we could be adversely affected by any such change in  or any new  us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation 
fees we or our reit affiliates receive will not be reit qualifying income 
we and our reit affiliates must satisfy two gross income tests annually to maintain qualification as a reit 
first  at least of a reit s gross income for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income that derive  directly or indirectly  from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or temporary investment income 
qualifying income for purposes of that gross income test generally includes rents from real property  interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property  and dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale of shares in other reits 
second  in general  at least of a reit s gross income for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  dividends  other types of interest  gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities  income from certain interest rate hedging contracts  or any combination of the foregoing 
gross income from any origination fees we or our reit affiliates obtain or from our sale of property that are held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is excluded from both income tests 
any origination fees we or our reit affiliates receive will not be qualifying income for purposes of the or gross income tests applicable to reits under the internal revenue code 
we typically receive  and our reit affiliates may receive  initial payments  or points  from borrowers as commitment fees or additional interest 
so long as the payment is for the use of money  rather than for other services provided by us or our reit affiliates  we believe that this income should not be classified as non qualifying origination fees 
however  the internal revenue service may seek to reclassify this income as origination fees instead of commitment fees or interest 
if we cannot satisfy the internal revenue code s income tests as a result of a successful challenge of our classification of this income  we may not qualify as a reit 
any fees for services  such as advisory fees or broker dealer fees  received by us or our reit affiliates will not qualify for either income test 
any such fees earned by a trs of ours or of one of our reit affiliates would not be subject to tax  and any distributions from trss would be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test but not for the gross income test 
a portion of the dividends we distribute may be deemed a return of capital for federal income tax purposes 
the amount of dividends we distribute to our common and preferred shareholders in a given quarter may not correspond to our taxable income for such quarter 
consequently  a portion of the dividends we distribute may be deemed a return of capital for federal income tax purposes  and will not be taxable but will reduce shareholders basis in the underlying common or preferred shares 
our ability to use trss  and consequently our ability to establish fee generating businesses and invest in securitizations  will be limited by the election made by us to be taxed as a reit  which may adversely affect returns to our shareholders 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more trss 
we and taberna currently own  and we  taberna and any other reit affiliates may own in the future  interests in 
table of contents additional trss 
however  our ability to expand the fee generating businesses of our and taberna s current trss and future trss we or our reit affiliates may form  will be limited by our and our reit affiliates need to meet this test  which may adversely affect distributions we pay to our shareholders 
if taberna fails to qualify as a reit  then we also would very likely fail to qualify as a reit and if any other significant reit affiliate fails to qualify as a reit  it would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
taberna is a reit subject to all of the risks discussed above with respect to rait 
if taberna fails to qualify as a reit  then we also would very likely fail to qualify as a reit  because the income we receive from  and assets we hold through  taberna make up a significant portion of our total income and assets and materially affect our ability to meet reit qualification tests 
the same is true with respect to other reit affiliates if the income derived from such reit affiliate becomes a significant part of our income 
other regulatory and legal risks of our business our reputation  business and operations could be adversely affected by regulatory compliance failures 
potential regulatory action poses a significant risk to our reputation and thereby to our business 
our business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in the other countries in which our investment activities occur 
we operate our business so as to comply with the internal revenue code s reit rules and regulations and so as to remain exempt from registration as an investment company under the investment company act 
the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra  oversee the activities of our broker dealer subsidiary 
in addition  we are subject to regulation under the exchange act  the investment advisers act and various other statutes 
a number of our investing activities  such as our lending business  are subject to regulation by various us state regulators 
each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of our business  including the authority to grant  and in specific circumstances to cancel  permissions to carry on particular businesses 
a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by any of the regulations binding on us or to maintain any of the licenses required to be maintained by us could result in investigations  sanctions and reputation damage 
loss of our investment company act exemption would affect us adversely 
we seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company 
under section a of the investment company act  a company is not deemed to be an investment company if it neither is  nor holds itself out as being  engaged primarily  nor proposes to engage primarily  in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  and it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
investment securities excludes us government securities and securities of majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act 
we rely on the test 
because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act  together with any other investment securities we may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis 
in fact  based on the relative value of our investment in taberna  on the one hand  and our investment in rait partnership  on the other hand  we can comply with the test only if taberna satisfies the test on which it relies or another exemption other than section c 
table of contents or c and rait partnership complies with section c c or c  the exemptions upon which it relies or another exemption other than section c or c 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries 
because rait partnership and the two wholly owned subsidiaries through which we hold of the partnership interests in rait partnership rait general  inc and rait limited  inc 
will not be relying on section c or c for their respective investment company act exemptions  our investments in these securities will not constitute investment securities for purposes of the test if rait partnership is otherwise exempt from the investment company act 
rait partnership  our subsidiary that holds  directly and through wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  a substantial portion of our assets  intends to conduct its operations so that it is not required to register as an investment company in reliance on the exemption from investment company act regulation provided under section c c 
rait partnership may also from time to time rely on the exemption from investment company act regulation provided under section c 
any entity relying on section c c for its investment company act exemption must have at least of its portfolio invested in qualifying assets which in general must consist of mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities that represent the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans and other liens on and interests in real estate and another of its portfolio invested in other real estate related assets 
based on no action letters issued by the staff of the sec  we classify our investments in mortgage loans as qualifying assets  as long as the loans are fully secured by an interest in real estate 
that is  if the loan to value ratio of the loan is equal to or less than  then we consider the loan to be a qualifying asset 
we do not consider loans with loan to value ratios in excess of to be qualifying assets that come within the basket  but only real estate related assets that come within the basket 
based on a no action letter issued by the staff of the sec  we treat most of our mezzanine loans as qualifying assets because we usually obtain a first lien position on the entire ownership interest of a special purpose entity  or spe  that owns only real property  or that owns the entire ownership interest in a second spe that owns only real property  and otherwise comes within the conditions of the no action letter  and we treat any remaining mezzanine loans as real estate related assets that come within the basket 
the treatment of other investments as qualifying assets and real estate related assets  including equity investments in subsidiaries  is based on the characteristics of the underlying asset  in the case of a directly held investment  or the characteristics of the assets of the subsidiary  in the case of equity investments in subsidiaries 
any entity relying on section c for its investment company act exemption must be primarily engaged  directly or through majority owned subsidiaries  in one or more specified businesses  including a business described in section c c  or in one or more of such businesses from which not less than of its gross income during its last fiscal year was derived  together with an additional business or businesses other than investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities 
taberna  like rait  is a holding company that conducts its operations through subsidiaries 
accordingly  we intend to monitor taberna s holdings such that it will satisfy the test 
similar to securities issued to us  the securities issued to taberna by its subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company by section c or c of the investment company act  together with any other investment securities taberna may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which taberna may engage through these subsidiaries 
we make the determination of whether an entity is a majority owned subsidiary of rait  rait partnership or taberna 
the investment company act defines a majority owned subsidiary of a person as a company or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person  or by another company which is a majority owned subsidiary of such person 
the investment company act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling its owner or holder to vote for the election of directors of a company 
we treat 
table of contents companies  including future securitization subsidiaries  in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority owned subsidiaries for purposes of the test 
neither rait  rait partnership nor taberna has requested the sec to approve our treatment of any company as a majority owned subsidiary and the sec has not done so 
if the sec were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies  including securitizations  as majority owned subsidiaries  we would need to adjust our respective investment strategies and invest our respective assets in order to continue to pass the test 
any such adjustment in its investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on taberna and us 
a majority of taberna s subsidiaries are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act with respect to the assets in which they can invest to avoid being regulated as an investment company 
in particular  taberna s subsidiaries that are securitizations generally rely on rule a  an exemption from the investment company act provided for certain structured financing vehicles that pool income producing assets and issue securities backed by those assets 
such structured financings may not engage in portfolio management practices resembling those employed by mutual funds 
accordingly  each taberna securitization subsidiary that relies on rule a is subject to an indenture which contains specific guidelines and restrictions limiting the discretion of the securitization 
the indenture prohibits the securitization from acquiring and disposing of assets primarily for the purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses resulting from market value changes 
certain sales and purchases of assets  such as dispositions of collateral that has gone into default or is at risk of imminent default  may be made so long as they do not violate the guidelines contained in each indenture and are not based primarily on changes in market value 
the proceeds of permitted dispositions may be reinvested in collateral that is consistent with the credit profile of the securitization under specific and predetermined guidelines 
in addition  absent obtaining further guidance from the sec  substitutions of assets may not be made solely for the purpose of enhancing the investment returns of the holders of the equity securities issued by the securitization 
as a result of these restrictions  taberna s securitization subsidiaries may suffer losses on their assets and taberna may suffer losses on its investments in its securitization subsidiaries 
if the combined value of the investment securities issued to taberna by its subsidiaries that are excepted by section c or c of the investment company act  together with any other investment securities taberna may own  exceeds of taberna s total assets on an unconsolidated basis  taberna may be required either to substantially change the manner in which it conducts its operations or to rely on section c or c to avoid having to register as an investment company  either of which could have an adverse effect on taberna and us 
if taberna were to rely on section c or c  then we would no longer comply with our own exemption from registration as an investment company 
none of rait  rait partnership or taberna has received a no action letter from the sec regarding whether it complies with the investment company act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the investment company act that it is using 
to the extent that the sec provides more specific or different guidance regarding  for example  the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate related assets  we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly 
any additional guidance from the sec could provide additional flexibility to us and taberna  or it could further inhibit the ability of taberna and our combined company to pursue our respective investment and financing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on us 
see item business certain reit and investment company act limits on our strategies investment company act limits 
our ownership limitation may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than in value of our outstanding capital shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits any person from owning more than or  with respect to our original promoter  resource america  inc   of our outstanding common shares and provides that a transfer that violates the limitation is void 

table of contents a transferee gets no rights to the shares that violate the limitation 
shares acquired that violate the limitation transfer automatically to a trust whose trustee has all voting and other rights 
shares in the trust will be sold and the record holder will receive the net proceeds of the sale 
the ownership limitation may discourage a takeover or other transaction that our shareholders believe to be desirable 
preferred shares may prevent change in control 
our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to issue preferred shares  to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued  to classify any unissued preferred shares and reclassify any previously classified but unissued preferred shares  without shareholder approval 
the issuance of preferred shares could delay or prevent a change in control  apart from the ownership limitation  even if a majority of our shareholders want control to change 
maryland anti takeover statutes may restrict business combination opportunities 
as a maryland reit  we are subject to various provisions of maryland law which impose restrictions and require that specified procedures be followed with respect to the acquisition of control shares representing at least ten percent of our aggregate voting power and certain takeover offers and business combinations  including  but not limited to  combinations with persons who own one tenth or more of our outstanding shares 
while we have elected to opt out of the control share acquisition statute  our board of trustees has the right to rescind the election at any time without notice to our shareholders 
if our subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers fail to comply with the investment advisers act  this could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage securitizations 
our subsidiaries  rait partnership and tcm  are registered investment advisers under the investment advisers act of  or the investment advisers act  and  as such  are supervised by the sec 
we registered rait partnership and tcm under the investment advisers act so that they could manage increasing numbers of securitizations or otherwise provide advisory services 
we expect to register additional affiliates of rait providing advisory services to our sponsored reits and other public and private investment vehicles we sponsor in the future 
the investment advisers act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous obligations  including record keeping requirements  operational procedures and disclosure obligations 
such subsidiaries may also be registered with various states and  thus  subject to the oversight and regulation by such states regulatory agencies 
if we do not comply with these requirements  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our securitizations and provide advisory services to our sponsored non listed reits and any private investment vehicles 
our failure to maintain a broker dealer license in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
finra has granted our membership application for a broker dealer license for our subsidiary  independence securities 
we also are required to maintain licenses with state securities regulators 
failure to maintain independence securities licenses as a broker dealer with finra and applicable state regulators would prevent it from serving as the dealer manager for the securities offerings of our sponsored non listed reits and any private investment vehicles and earning related fees or engaging in trading and advisory services 
in that event  we may need to engage a third party broker dealer to act as a dealer manager 
if independence securities is unable to receive fees related to its dealer manager services or engage in trading and advisory services  it would have less cash available for distribution to rait 
in addition  any failure by independence securities to obtain a broker dealer license in the various jurisdictions relevant to any securities offering by our sponsored non listed reits and any private investment vehicles could have a material adverse effect on such offerings and our ability to derive benefits from our sponsored non listed reits and any private investment vehicles
