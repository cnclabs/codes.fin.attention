item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to our plans  estimates  beliefs and anticipated future financial performance 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors  special note regarding forward looking statements and elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are a leading provider of on demand software solutions for the rental housing industry 
our broad range of property management solutions enable owners and managers of single family and a wide variety of multi family rental property types to manage their marketing  pricing  screening  leasing  accounting  purchasing and other property operations 
we deliver our on demand software solutions via the internet through an integrated software platform that provides a single point of access and a shared repository of prospect  resident and property data 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our on demand software solutions 
we also derive revenue from our professional and other services 
a small percentage of our revenue is derived from sales of our on premise software solutions to our existing on premise customers 
our on demand software solutions are sold pursuant to subscription license agreements  and our on premise software solutions are sold pursuant to term or perpetual license agreements and associated maintenance agreements 
typically  we price our solutions based primarily on the number of units the customer manages with our solutions 
for our insurance and transaction based solutions  we price based on a fixed commission rate of earned premiums or a fixed rate per transaction  respectively 
we sell our solutions through our direct sales organization and derive substantially all of our revenue from sales in the united states 
our revenue has increased from million in to million in the increase in revenue has primarily been driven by increased sales of our on demand software solutions  a substantial amount of which has been derived from purchases of additional on demand software solutions by our existing customers 
in  our on demand revenue represented of our total revenue 
while the adoption of on demand software solutions in the rental housing industry is growing rapidly  it remains at a relatively early stage of development 
additionally  there is a low level of penetration of our on demand software solutions in our existing customer base 
we believe these factors present us with significant opportunities to generate revenue through sales of additional on demand software solutions 
our existing and potential customers base their decisions to invest in our solutions on a number of factors  including general economic conditions 
accordingly  macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted our business in and may continue to negatively impact our business 
our company was formed in to acquire rent roll  inc  which marketed and sold on premise property management systems for the conventional and affordable multi family rental housing markets 
in june  we released onesite  our first on demand property management system 
since  we have expanded our on demand software solutions to include a number of software enabled value added services that provide complementary sales and marketing  asset optimization  risk mitigation  billing and utility management and spend management capabilities 
in connection with this expansion  we have allocated greater resources to the development and infrastructure needs of developing and increasing sales of our suite of on demand software solutions 
in addition  since july  we have completed acquisitions of complementary technologies to supplement our internal product development and sales and marketing efforts and expand the scope of our solutions  the types of rental housing properties served by our solutions and our customer base 
as of december   we had approximately  employees

table of contents new product family in august  we announced our new product family  leasestar  which will consolidate and integrate products and services related to our acquisitions of erei  levelone  seniorliving 
net  mts and our suite of products and services historically branded as crossfire 
we believe the leasestar product family will unify major organic and paid lead channels into a single marketplace where consumers can find a rental unit and transact business by viewing real time availability  pricing  pre qualify and lease online 
recent acquisitions in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of compliance depot llc compliance depot for approximately million which included a cash payment of million and three deferred payments of million each payable six  twelve and eighteen months after the acquisition date 
the acquisition of compliance depot expands our ability to provide vendor risk management and compliance software for the rental housing industry 
interfacing with vendors through a branded platform  compliance depot allows property managers and owners to track compliance with vendor obligations to carry workers compensation and general liability insurance  identify vendor bankruptcy filings  liens  criminal records  collections and professional license verification  confirm federal regulation compliance  such as the patriot act  as well as manage contractual agreements and federal and state tax documents

key business metrics in addition to traditional financial measures  we monitor our operating performance using a number of financially and non financially derived metrics that are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we monitor the key performance indicators reflected in the following table year ended december  in thousands  except dollar per unit data revenue total revenue on demand revenue on demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue ending on demand units average on demand units non gaap on demand revenue non gaap on demand revenue per average on demand unit adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue on demand revenue 
this metric represents the license and subscription fees for accessing our on demand software solutions  typically licensed for one year terms  commission income from sales of renter s insurance policies and transaction fees for certain of our on demand software solutions 
we consider on demand revenue to be a key business metric because we believe the market for our on demand software solutions represents the largest growth opportunity for our business 

table of contents on demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
this metric represents on demand revenue for the period presented divided by total revenue for the same period 
we use on demand revenue as a percentage of total revenue to measure our success in executing our strategy to increase the penetration of our on demand software solutions and expand our recurring revenue streams attributable to these solutions 
we expect our on demand revenue to remain a significant percentage of our total revenue although the actual percentage may vary from period to period due to a number of factors  including the timing of acquisitions  professional and other revenue and on premise perpetual license sales and maintenance fees resulting from our february acquisition 
ending on demand units 
this metric represents the number of rental housing units managed by our customers with one or more of our on demand software solutions at the end of the period 
we use ending on demand units to measure the success of our strategy of increasing the number of rental housing units managed with our on demand software solutions 
property unit counts are provided to us by our customers as new sales orders are processed 
property unit counts may be adjusted periodically as information related to our customers properties is updated or supplemented  which could result in adjusting the number of units previously reported 
we expect ending on demand units will continue to increase in and non gaap on demand revenue 
this metric represents on demand revenue adjusted to reverse the effect of the write down of deferred revenue associated with purchase accounting for strategic acquisitions 
we use this metric to evaluate our on demand revenue as we believe its inclusion provides a more accurate depiction of on demand revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions 
the following provides a reconciliation of non gaap on demand revenue year ended december  in thousands on demand revenue acquisition related deferred revenue adjustment non gaap on demand revenue non gaap on demand revenue per average on demand unit 
this metric represents non gaap on demand revenue for the period presented divided by average on demand units for the same period 
for interim periods  the calculation is performed on an annualized basis 
we calculate average on demand units as the average of the beginning and ending on demand units for each quarter in the period presented 
we monitor this metric to measure our success in increasing the number of on demand software solutions utilized by our customers to manage their rental housing units  our overall revenue and profitability 
adjusted ebitda 
we define this metric as net loss income plus depreciation and asset impairment  amortization of intangible assets  interest expense  net  income tax expense benefit  stock based compensation expense and acquisition related expense 
in  adjusted ebitda excludes litigation related expenses pertaining to the yardi litigation as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings 
beginning in the second quarter of  adjusted ebitda includes acquisition related deferred revenue adjustments 
we believe that the use of adjusted ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes certain non cash expenses  including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
for further discussion regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  refer to the table below 
our adjusted ebitda grew from approximately million in to approximately million in  as a result of our efforts to expand market share and increase revenue

table of contents key components of our results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from three primary sources our on demand software solutions  our on premise software solutions  and our professional and other services 
in    we generated revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
on demand revenue revenue from our on demand software solutions is comprised of license and subscription fees for accessing our on demand software solutions  typically licensed for one year terms  commission income from sales of renter s insurance policies  and transaction fees for certain on demand software solutions  such as payment processing  spend management and billing services 
typically  we price our on demand software solutions based primarily on the number of units the customer manages with our solutions 
for our insurance and transaction based solutions  we price based on a fixed commission rate of earned premiums or a fixed rate per transaction  respectively 
in  and  revenue from our on demand software solutions was approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing approximately  and of our total revenue for the same periods 
revenue from our on demand software solutions has continued to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue as we have ceased actively marketing our legacy on premise software solutions to new customers and as many of our existing on premise customers have transitioned to our on demand software solutions 
we expect our on demand revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in  although the actual percentage of revenue may vary from period to period due to a number of factors  including the impact of acquisitions and revenue derived from our professional and other services related to our on demand software solutions 
on premise revenue our on premise software solutions are distributed to our customers and maintained locally on the customers hardware 
revenue from our on premise software solutions is comprised of license fees under term and perpetual license agreements 
typically  we have licensed our on premise software solutions pursuant to term license agreements with an initial term of one year that include maintenance and support 
customers can renew their term license agreement for additional one year terms at renewal price levels 
in february  we completed a strategic acquisition of assets that included on premise software solutions that were historically marketed and sold pursuant to perpetual license agreements and related maintenance agreements 
we no longer actively market our legacy on premise software solutions to new customers  and only license our on premise software solutions to a small portion of our existing on premise customers as they expand their portfolio of rental housing properties 
for the on premise software solutions acquired in february  we expect many of these customers to migrate to our on demand solutions over time  however  we will continue to support these on premise software solutions for the foreseeable future and integrate our software enabled value added services into them 
in  and  revenue from our on premise software solutions was approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing approximately  and  and of our total revenue for the same periods  respectively 
revenue from our on premise software solutions has continued to decrease in absolute dollars as we have ceased actively marketing our legacy on premise software solutions to new customers and as many of our existing on premise customers have transitioned to our on demand software solutions 
we expect our legacy on premise revenue to decrease over time in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue 
in addition  the actual percentage of revenue may vary from period to period due to a number of factors  including the impact of our recent and potential future acquisition of on premise software solutions 
professional and other revenue revenue from professional and other services consists of consulting and implementation services  training and other ancillary services 
we complement our solutions with professional and other services for our customers willing to invest in enhancing the value or decreasing the implementation time of our solutions 
professional and other services engagements are typically time and material 
in  and  revenue from professional and other services was approximately million  million million  respectively  representing approximately  and of our total revenue for the same periods  respectively 
we expect professional and other services will represent or less of our total revenue in and consistent with our performance for the previous three years 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs related to our operations  support services  training and implementation services  expenses related to the operation of our data center and fees paid to third party service providers 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and employee benefits 
cost of revenue also includes an allocation of facilities costs  overhead costs and depreciation  as well as amortization of acquired technology related to strategic acquisitions and amortization of capitalized development costs 
we allocate facilities costs  overhead costs and depreciation based on headcount 
we expect our cost of revenue in and to increase in absolute dollars 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories product development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  costs for third party contracted development  marketing  legal  accounting and consulting services and other professional service fees 
personnel costs for each category of operating expenses include salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and employee benefits for employees in that category 
in addition  our operating expenses include an allocation of our facilities costs  overhead costs and depreciation based on headcount for that category  as well as amortization of purchased intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions 
our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars in each of and as we have built infrastructure and added employees across all categories in order to accelerate and support our growth and to expand our markets 
we expect our operating expenses in and to continue to increase in absolute dollars as compared to but decrease as a percentage of revenue  as the capacity we have added in prior years is more fully utilized and we continue to create operating leverage 
product development 
product development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our product development employees and executives and fees to contract development vendors 
our product development efforts are focused primarily on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand software solutions and expanding our suite of on demand software solutions 
in and  we established a product development and service center in hyderabad  india and manila  philippines  respectively  to take advantage of strong technical talent at lower personnel costs compared to the united states 
we expect our product development expenses in and to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees and executives  travel and entertainment and marketing programs 
marketing programs consist of amounts paid for online advertising  including search engine optimization seo and search engine marketing sem  renter s insurance and other advertising  tradeshows  user conferences  public relations  industry sponsorships and affiliations and product marketing 
in addition  sales and marketing expense includes amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  including customer relationships and key vendor and supplier relationships obtained in connection with our acquisitions 
we expect our sales and marketing expense in and to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive  finance and accounting  human resources  management information systems and legal personnel  as well as legal  accounting and other professional service fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expense in and to increase in absolute dollars as compared to interest expense  net interest expense  net  consists primarily of interest income and interest expense 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense for  and is associated with our term loan  revolver  secured promissory note  promissory note issued to preferred stockholders  capital lease obligations and certain acquisition related liabilities 
total amounts outstanding under our interest bearing obligations at december   and include as of december  in thousands term loan revolver secured promissory note promissory notes issued to preferred stockholders capital lease obligations interest bearing acquisition related liabilities based on our current operations  we expect our interest expense in to remain consistent with expense 

table of contents income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million 
if not utilized  our federal net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in and the state operating losses will begin to expire in net operating losses generated by us are not currently subject to the section limitation  however certain net operating losses generated by subsidiaries prior to their acquisition by us are subject to the section limitation 
the limitation on these pre acquisition net operating loss carryforwards will fully expire in a cumulative change in ownership among material shareholders  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  during a three year period may limit utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in some instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances results could differ significantly from our estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  accounts receivable  business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets  stock based compensation  income taxes and capitalized product development costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we believe the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our management s judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from three primary sources our on demand software solutions  our on premise software solutions  and professional and other services 
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the solution and or service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
for multi element arrangements that include multiple solutions and or services  we allocate arrangement consideration to all deliverables that have stand alone value based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we utilize the following hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available 
the price at which we sell the element in a separate stand alone transaction  third party evidence of selling price tpe  if vsoe of selling price is not available 
evidence from us or other companies of the value of a largely interchangeable element in a transaction  and estimated selling price esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price is available 
our best estimate of the stand alone selling price of an element in a transaction 
our process for determining esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key factors primarily considered in developing esp include prices charged by us for similar offerings when sold separately  pricing policies and approvals from standard pricing and other business objectives 

table of contents from time to time  we sell on demand software solutions with professional services 
in such cases  we allocate arrangement consideration based on our estimated selling price of the on demand software solution and vsoe of the selling price of the professional services 
on demand revenue our on demand revenue consists of license and subscription fees  transaction fees related to certain of our software enabled value added services and commissions derived from us selling certain risk mitigation services 
license and subscription fees are comprised of a charge billed at the initial order date and monthly or annual subscription fees for accessing our on demand software solutions 
the license fee billed at the initial order date is recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the longer of the contractual term or the period in which the customer is expected to benefit  which we consider to be four years 
recognition starts once the product has been activated 
revenue from monthly and annual subscription fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the access period 
as part of our risk mitigation services to the rental housing industry  we act as an insurance agent and derive commission revenue from the sale of insurance products to individuals 
the commissions are based upon a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder and are subject to forfeiture in instances where a policyholder cancels prior to the end of the policy 
if the policy is cancelled  our commissions are forfeited as a percent of the unearned premium 
as a result  we recognize the commissions related to these services ratably over the policy term as the associated premiums are earned 
additionally  we earn a contingent commission based upon loss experience of the policies sold by us 
our estimate of this contingent commission is recorded quarterly based on actual and estimated claims and losses 
we recognize revenue from transaction fees derived from certain of our software enabled value added services as the related services are performed 
on premise revenue revenue from our on premise software solutions is comprised of an annual term license  which includes maintenance and support 
customers can renew their annual term license for additional one year terms at renewal price levels 
we recognize the annual term license on a straight line basis over the license term 
in addition  we have arrangements that include perpetual licenses with maintenance and other services to be provided over a fixed term 
we allocate and defer revenue equivalent to the vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue 
we have determined that we do not have vsoe of fair value for our customer support and professional services in these specific arrangements 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element sales agreements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for fees received under multiple element arrangements with customer support or other professional services as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement ratably over the longer of the customer support period or the period during which professional services are rendered 
professional and other revenue professional and other revenue is recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
accounts receivable for several of our solutions  we invoice our customers prior to the period in which service is provided 
accounts receivable represent trade receivables from customers when we have invoiced for software solutions and or services and we have not yet received payment 
we present accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments  or the customer cancelling prior to the service being rendered 
in doing so  we consider the current financial condition of the customer  the specific details of the customer account  the age of the outstanding balance  the current economic environment and historical credit trends 
as a result of a portion of our allowance being for services not yet rendered and  therefore  is charged as an offset to deferred revenue  which does not have an effect on the statement of operations 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable might result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
for certain transactions  we have met the requirements to recognize income in advance of physically invoing the customer 
in these instances  we record an asset for the amount that will be due from the customer upon invoicing 

table of contents business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the total consideration to the fair value of tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on the application of valuation models using historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives we test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment separately on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year 
additionally  we will test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the interim if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives may be impaired 
the events and circumstances that we consider include significant under performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business and or product strategies 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required using a two step process 
the first step of the two step test involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying amount of the goodwill of that reporting unit and determination of the impairment charge  if any 
we evaluate other intangible assets with indefinite lives by estimating the fair value of those assets based on estimated future earnings derived from the assets using the income approach model 
for those intangible assets with indefinite lives that have been determined to be inseparable due to their interchangeable use  we have grouped into single units of accounting for purposes of testing for impairment 
if the carrying amount of the other intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds the fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in conjunction with all our business acquisitions completed since the beginning of we test goodwill for impairment based on a single reporting unit 
we believe we operate in a single reporting unit because our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review our operating results other than at a consolidated level for purposes of decision making regarding resource allocation and operating performance 
impairment of long lived assets we perform an impairment review of long lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business and or product strategies and significant industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these indicators  we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
we would then recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of acquired developed product technologies  acquired customer relationships  vendor relationships  non competition agreements and trade names 
we record intangible assets at fair value and amortize those with finite lives over the shorter of the contractual life or the estimated useful life 
we estimate the useful lives of acquired developed product technologies and customer relationships based on factors that include the planned use of each developed product technology and the expected pattern of future cash flows to be derived from each developed product technology and existing customer relationships 
we include amortization of acquired developed product technologies in cost of revenue  amortization of acquired customer relationships in sales and marketing expenses and amortization of vendor relationships and non competition agreements in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation our share based compensation is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis 
the fair value of option awards is calculated through the use of option pricing models 
these models require subjective assumptions regarding future share price volatility and the expected life of each option grant 
the fair value of employee stock options was estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model by applying the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rates expected option life in years dividend yield expected volatility at each stock option grant date  we utilized peer group data to calculate our expected volatility 
expected volatility was based on historical and expected volatility rates of comparable publicly traded peers 
expected life is computed using the mid point between the vesting period and contractual life of the options granted 
the risk free interest rate was based on the treasury yield rate with a maturity corresponding to the expected option life assumed at the grant date 
changes to the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
prior to our initial public offering  we granted stock options at exercise prices above the fair value of our common stock as of the grant date  as determined by our compensation committee on a contemporaneous basis 
given the absence of any active market for our common stock  the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options granted was determined by our compensation committee  with input from our management 
in arriving at these valuations  our compensation committee and management also considered contemporaneous third party valuations 
options granted subsequent to our initial public offering have been granted at fair market value as of the date of grant 
the fair value of our time based restricted stock awards is based on the closing price on the date of grant 
for our performance based restricted stock awards  we recognize compensation expense based on the probability of achievement of the performance condition 
income taxes income taxes are provided based on the liability method  which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
the liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted 
the liability method also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
we may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
upon our adoption of the related standard  there was no liability for uncertain tax positions due to the fact that there were no material identified tax benefits that were considered uncertain positions 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
we consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results  if any  and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies  if any 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
given the nature of our recurring revenue streams  we believe we have a reasonable basis to estimate future taxable income 

table of contents capitalized product development costs we capitalize specific product development costs  including costs to develop software products or the software components of our solutions to be marketed to our customers  as well as software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development related to research  project planning  training  maintenance and general and administrative activities  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to the software are also expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs incurred in the performance of application development stage activities  including materials  services and payroll related costs for employees are capitalized  if direct and incremental  until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
we capitalized million and million of product development costs during the years ended december  and  respectively  and recognized amortization expense of million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively  included as a component of cost of revenue 
unamortized product development cost was million  million and at december  and  respectively 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets

in  adjusted ebitda excludes litigation related expenses pertaining to the yardi litigation as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings 
beginning in the second quarter of  adjusted ebitda includes acquisition related deferred revenue adjustments 
we believe that the use of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance  facilitates period to period comparisons of operations and facilitates comparisons with our peer companies  many of which use similar non gaap financial measures to supplement their gaap results  and it is useful to exclude certain non cash charges  such as depreciation and asset impairment  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation and non core operational charges  such as acquisition related expense  from adjusted ebitda because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions  full amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets or the timing of new stock based awards  as the case may be 
we use adjusted ebitda in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
we do not place undue reliance on adjusted ebitda as our only measure of operating performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of liquidity or financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do  that they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital 
we compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using the adjusted ebitda measures through disclosure of these limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income loss

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  working capital excluding deferred revenue and cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and service our debt obligations for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and size of acquisitions  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions
