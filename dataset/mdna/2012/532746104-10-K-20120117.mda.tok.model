overview limoneira company was incorporated in delaware in as the successor to several businesses with operations in california since we are an agribusiness and real estate development company founded and based in santa paula  california  committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately  acres of land  water resources and other assets to maximize long term stockholder value 
our current operations consist of fruit production  sales and marketing  real estate development and capital investment activities 
we are one of california s oldest citrus growers 
according to sunkist  we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the united states and  according to the california avocado commission  the largest grower of avocados in the united states 
in addition to growing lemons and avocados  we grow oranges and a variety of other specialty citrus and other crops 
we have agricultural plantings throughout ventura and tulare counties in california  which plantings consist of approximately  acres of lemons   acres of avocados   acres of oranges and acres of specialty citrus and other crops 
we also operate our own packinghouse in santa paula  california  where we process and pack lemons that we grow  as well as lemons grown by others 
our water resources include water rights  usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under  and canals that run through  the land we own 
water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land  which includes rights to water in the adjudicated santa paula basin aquifer and the un adjudicated fillmore  santa barbara and paso robles basins aquifers 
we also use ground water and water from local water districts in tulare county  which is in the san joaquin valley 
for more than years  we have been making strategic investments in california agribusiness and real estate development 
we currently have six active real estate development projects in california 
these projects include multi family housing and single family homes comprised of completed units and another  units in various stages of development 
we have three business segments agribusiness  rental operations and real estate development 
our agribusiness segment currently generates the majority of our revenue from its farming and lemon packing and sales operations  our rental operations segment generates revenue from our housing  organic recycling and commercial and leased land operations  and our real estate development segment primarily generates revenues from the sale of real estate development projects 
from a general view  we see our company as a land and farming company that generates annual cash flows to support its progress into diversified real estate development activities 
as real estate developments are monetized  our agriculture business will then be able to expand more rapidly into new regions and markets 
recent developments on november   our company began marketing and selling its lemons directly to its food service  wholesale and retail customers throughout the united states  canada  asia and certain other international markets 
on february   we completed the exercise of the purchase option contained in our lease of the rancho refugio caldwell ranch  which allowed us to acquire the property for a purchase price of  concurrently with the close of our purchase option  we sold the property for  to rancho guacamole  llc  a california limited liability company 
the gain on the sale was  net of the  purchase price   remaining capitalized in leasehold improvements and  of selling and transaction costs 
the net cash realized from the transaction was  in march  lafco approved conditions that will allow for the annexation and incorporation of east area into the city of santa paula 
in may  our company sold donna circle for  cash  realizing net cash of  after selling and other transaction costs 
the carrying value of the property at the time of sale was  net of a second quarter impairment charge of  in august  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec in accordance with the securities act of  as amended 
utilizing a shelf registration process  we registered common stock  par value per share  which may be offered and sold in one or more offerings at indeterminate prices for a maximum aggregate offering price of up to  effective november   we amended the interest rate on one of the term loans we have with farm credit west to a fixed rate of for three years 
the interest rate for this loan had been until october  and would have converted to a variable rate on november  the balance of the term loan is approximately million at october  and it requires monthly principal and interest installments until october on november   we amended certain terms of our rabobank credit facility 
the maturity date was extended to june  from june   and the borrowing capacity was increased to million from million  subject to underlying collateral value 
the interest rate for the amended line of credit will be the london interbank offer rate libor plus beginning july  until the maturity date 
currently  the interest rate on the line of credit is libor plus and the principal balance is approximately million at october  additionally  on november  we entered into a forward interest rate swap to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with the rabobank credit facility 
the forward interest rate swap establishes a fixed interest rate of on million of outstanding line of credit borrowings beginning july  until june  we currently have an interest rate swap which locks in the interest rate on million of outstanding line of credit borrowings at until june  in january  our company entered into a series of operating leases for approximately  acres of lemon  orange  specialty citrus and other crop orchards in lindsay  california 
each of the leases is for a ten year term and provides for four five year renewal options with an aggregate base rent of approximately  per year 
the leases also contain profit share arrangements with the landowners as additional rent on each of the properties and a provision for the potential purchase of the properties by limoneira in the future 
due to the timing of the growing and harvesting seasons and as a result that the farming costs associated with the leased property were incurred by the lessor prior to lease commencement  limoneira will not share in the citrus crop revenue in its fiscal year fiscal year and forward operating results on the leased property are expected to be similar on a per acre basis as existing citrus orchard operating results

as a result of the re negotiated terms  the remaining interest rate swap no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and accordingly  fair value adjustments from april  are included in interest expense

real estate development activities and related capital resources as noted under transactions affecting liquidity and capital resources  we have the ability to control the timing of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based upon our liquidity demands 
in order for our real estate development operations to reach their maximum potential benefit to our company  however  we will need to be successful over time in identifying other third party sources of capital to partner with us to move those development projects forward 
while we are in discussions with several external sources of capital in respect to all of our development projects  current market conditions for california real estate projects  while improving  continue to be challenging and make it difficult to predict the timing and amounts of future capital that will be required to complete the development of our projects 
trend information agribusiness the worldwide fresh produce industry has historically enjoyed consistent underlying demand and favorable growth dynamics 
in recent years  the market for fresh produce has increased faster than the rate of population growth  supported by ongoing trends including greater consumer demand for healthy  fresh and convenient foods  increased retailer square footage devoted to fresh produce  and greater emphasis on fresh produce as a differentiating factor in attracting customers 
health conscious consumers are driving much of the growth in demand for fresh produce 
over the past several decades  the benefits of natural  preservative free foods have become an increasingly significant element of the public dialogue on health and nutrition 
as a result  consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables has markedly increased 
according to the usda  americans consumed an additional pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables per capita in than they did in the usda reports that per capita fresh lemon consumption was pounds in and since has averaged pounds per capita versus pounds in the s 
the usda forecasts the us lemon crop at  tons  a reduction of more than compared to and lemon prices are expected to rise later in the year due to the reduction in domestic supplies 
california is expected to produce  tons of the us lemon crop in  with approximately of the crop historically going to the fresh market in the past decade 
the fresh market is significantly more profitable than the processed market and the amount of production sold in the fresh market is referred to as fresh utilization 
our fresh utilization has historically been comparable to the california industry average and we expect that our fresh utilization will increase due to increased flexibility to sell lemons directly to food service wholesale and retail customers and increased customer interaction resulting from our direct lemon sales strategy 
according to the usda  the us per capita consumption of avocados has increased in recent years from pounds per capita in to pounds per capita in consumption was down to pounds per capita in due to decreased supply  but was still within average levels of recent years 
a growing hispanic population  an increasing awareness of healthier foods and the acceptance of mono unsaturated fats has helped to spur demand for avocados 
california is the largest us producer of avocados and the crop of million pounds was the second largest in the last ten years and fourth largest in california avocado production history 
at million pounds  production in california in declined  resulting in higher prices for avocados 
the usda estimates that us avocado production and avocado imports will be higher in than  likely putting downward pressure on avocado prices 
we expect that due to the alternate bearing nature of avocado trees where a large crop is typically followed by a smaller crop  our avocado production is likely to be higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year the usda forecasts california s orange crop to be down nearly from last season 
the decline is entirely due to a smaller navel crop of million tons  down from last year s record production of million tons 
in contrast  california valencia orange production is projected to remain unchanged from last year 
a smaller california orange crop this year will likely help support grower prices 
real estate development according to most accounts  the residential real estate market continues to be weak following the well known economic downturn in recent years 
persistent high unemployment is expected to keep home sales at historically low levels in terms of volume and price 
our company has incurred impairment charges on certain of its real estate development projects over the last three years and future impairment is possible 
due to these factors  we anticipate maintaining a cautious and patient perspective with respect to our real estate development activities 
however  interest rates are also at historically low levels  which provide a favorable buying opportunity for potential home buyers 
additionally  we believe that our real estate development properties have certain unique characteristics and are located in desirable locations  in particular east area i  and as economic or real estate market conditions improve or other factors arise  we will take advantage of such opportunities to develop our properties 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents our company s contractual obligations at october  for which cash flows are fixed and determinable payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years fixed rate debt principal variable rate debt principal operating lease obligations total contractual obligations interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt we believe that the cash flows from our agribusiness and rental operations segments as well as available borrowing capacity from our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure  debt service  working capital and other contractual obligations for fiscal year in addition  we have the ability to control the timing of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based on our liquidity demands 
fixed rate and variable rate debt details of amounts included in long term debt can be found above and in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the table above assumes that long term debt is held to maturity 
interest payments on fixed and variable debt the above table assumes that our fixed rate and long term debt is held to maturity and the interest rates on our variable rate debt remains unchanged for the remaining life of the debt from those in effect at october  preferred stock dividends in  in connection with the acquisition of ronald michaelis ranches  inc  our company issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at par value the series b stock 
the holders of the series b stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of of par value 
such dividends are payable quarterly on the first day of january  april  july and october in each year commencing july  and totaled million in each of the fiscal years  and defined benefit pension plan our company has a noncontributory  defined benefit  single employer pension plan the plan  which provides retirement benefits for all eligible employees of the company 
effective june  the company froze the plan and no additional benefits accrued to participants subsequent to that date 
we may make discretionary contributions to the plan and we may be required to make contributions to adhere to applicable regulatory funding provisions  based in part on the plan s asset valuations and underlying actuarial assumptions 
there were funding contributions of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively and we expect to contribute approximately  to the plan in fiscal year operating lease obligations our company has numerous operating lease commitments with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to ten years 
our company has installed a one mega watt photovoltaic solar array on one of its agricultural properties located in ventura county that produces the majority of the power to run its lemon packinghouse 
the construction of this array was financed by farm credit leasing and our company has a long term lease with farm credit leasing for this array 
annual payments for this lease are million  and at the end of ten years our company has an option to purchase the array for million 
our company entered into a similar transaction with farm credit leasing for a second photovoltaic array at one of its agricultural properties located in the san joaquin valley to supply the majority of the power to operate four deep water well pumps located on the company s property 
annual lease payments for this facility range from million to million  and at the end of ten years our company has the option to purchase the array for million 
our company leases pollination equipment under a lease through with annual payments of million 
our company also leases machinery and equipment for its packing operations and land for its growing operations under leases with annual lease commitments that are individually immaterial 
in january  our company entered into a series of operating leases for approximately  acres of lemon  orange  specialty citrus and other crop orchards in lindsay  california 
each of the leases is for ten year terms and provides for four five year renewal options with an aggregate base rent of approximately  per year 
the leases also contain profit share arrangements with the landowners as additional rent on each of the properties and a provision for the potential purchase of the properties by limoneira in the future 
due to the timing of the growing and harvesting seasons and as a result that the farming costs associated with the leased property were incurred by the lessor prior to lease commencement  limoneira will not share in the citrus crop revenue in its fiscal year fiscal year and forward operating results on the leased property are expected to be similar on a per acre basis as existing citrus orchard operating results 
these lease obligations are included in the table on the previous page 
significant accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of accounts receivable  cultural costs  long lived assets including real estate development assets and property  plant and equipment  income taxes  retirement benefits  valuation of derivative instruments and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of significant accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to significant accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable our company grants credit in the course of its operations to cooperatives  companies and lessees of our company s facilities 
our company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral 
our company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its receivables as required based on accounts receivable aging and other factors 
in addition  we record a sales allowance in the period revenue is recognized as a provision for estimated customer discounts and concessions 
cultural costs costs of bringing crops to harvest are capitalized as incurred 
such costs are expensed when the crops are sold and are recorded in agribusiness cost and expenses in our company s consolidated statement of operations 
costs incurred during the current year related to the next year s crop are capitalized until the crop is harvested and sold 
long lived assets our company evaluates long lived assets  including its definite life intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset  a write down is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
derivative instruments our company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  or contracts for which our company has not elected hedge accounting  are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change 
retirement benefits our company has a defined benefit pension plan that  effective june  was frozen to new participants and no additional benefits accrue to participants subsequent to that date 
the accounting and reporting for the plan requires assumptions and estimates regarding fair value and estimated return of plan assets and estimated benefit obligations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to develop critical accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  available relevant data and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as new or additional information become available in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition as a general policy  revenue and related costs are recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii selling price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we record a sales allowance in the period revenue is recognized as a provision for estimated customer discounts and concessions 
agribusiness revenue revenue from the sales of certain of our company s agricultural products is recorded based on estimated proceeds provided by certain of our company s sales and marketing partners calavo and other third party packinghouses due to the time between when the product is delivered by our company and the closing of the pools for such fruits at the end of each month 
calavo and other third party packinghouses are agricultural cooperatives or function in a similar manner as an agricultural cooperative 
as such  our company applies specific authoritative agriculture revenue recognition guidance related to transactions between patrons and agriculture marketing cooperatives to record revenue at time of delivery to the packinghouses relating to fruits that are in pools that have not yet closed at month end if i the related fruits have been delivered to and accepted by calavo and other third party packinghouses ie title has transferred to calavo and other third party packinghouses and ii sales price information has been provided by calavo and other third party packinghouses based on the marketplace activity for the related fruit to estimate with reasonable certainty the final selling price for the fruit upon the closing of the pools 
historically  the revenue that is recorded based on the sales price information provided to our company by calavo and other third party packinghouses at the time of delivery have not materially differed from the actual amounts that are paid after the monthly pools are closed 
our company s avocados  oranges  specialty citrus and other specialty crops are packed and sold by calavo and other third party packinghouses 
specifically  our company delivers all of its avocado production from its orchards to calavo 
these avocados are then packed by calavo at its packinghouse  and sold and distributed under calavo brands to its customers primarily in the united states and canada 
our company s arrangements with other third party packinghouses related to its oranges  specialty citrus and other specialty crops are similar to its arrangement with calavo 
our company s arrangements with its third party packinghouses are such that our company is the producer and supplier of the product and the third party packinghouses are our company s customers 
the revenues our company recognizes related to the fruits sold to the third party packinghouses are based on the volume and quality of the fruits delivered  and the market price for such fruit  less the packinghouses charges to pack and market the fruit 
such packinghouse charges include the grading  sizing  packing  cooling  ripening and marketing of the related fruit 
our company bears inventory risk until the product is delivered to the third party packinghouses at which time title and inventory risk to the product is transferred to the third party packinghouses and revenue is recognized 
such third party packinghouse charges are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on the application of specific authoritative revenue recognition guidance related to a vendor s income statement characterization of consideration given to a customer 
the identifiable benefit our company receives from the third party packinghouses for packaging and marketing services cannot be sufficiently separated from the third party packinghouses purchase of our company s products 
in addition  our company is not able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received from the third party packinghouses for such services and  as such  these costs are characterized as a reduction of revenue in our company s consolidated statement of operations 
revenue from crop insurance proceeds is recorded when the amount of and the right to receive the payment can be reasonably determined 
our company recorded agribusiness revenues from crop insurance proceeds related to avocados of  zero and  in fiscal years  and rental revenue minimum rental revenues are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the respective initial lease term 
contingent rental revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of rent received by our company and are based on fees collected by the lessee 
our company s rental arrangements generally require payment on a monthly or quarterly basis 
real estate development revenue our company recognizes revenue on real estate development projects in accordance with fasb asc  real estate sales sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  which provides for profit to be recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided that a sale has been consummated and profit is determinable  collection of sales proceeds is estimable with the seller s receivable not subject to subordination  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the earnings process is substantially complete with no significant seller activities or obligations required after the date of sale 
to the extent the above conditions are not met  a portion or all of the profit is deferred 
incidental operations may occur during the holding or development period of real estate development projects to reduce holding or development costs 
incremental revenue from incidental operations in excess of incremental costs from incidental operations is accounted for as a reduction of development costs 
incremental costs from incidental operations in excess of incremental revenue from incidental operations are charged to operations 
real estate development costs we capitalize the planning  entitlement  construction and development costs associated with our various real estate projects 
costs that are not capitalized are expensed as incurred 
a real estate development project is considered substantially complete upon the cessation of construction and development activities 
once a project is substantially completed  future costs are expensed as incurred 
for fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of costs related to our real estate projects and expensed approximately million of costs 
for fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of costs related to real estate development and expensed approximately million 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
contract terms of our hedge instruments closely mirror those of the hedged item  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  or contracts for which we have not elected hedge accounting  are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets including our real estate development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of the economic downturn  in recent years we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these charges were based on independent  third party appraisals provided to us and were developed using various facts  assumption and estimates 
future changes in these facts  assumptions and estimates could result in additional changes 
defined benefit retirement plan as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we sponsor a defined benefit retirement plan that was frozen in june  and no future benefits accrued to participants subsequent to that time 
ongoing accounting for this plan under fasb asc provides guidance as to  among other things  future estimated pension expense  minimum pension liability and future minimum funding requirements 
this information is provided to us by third party actuarial consultants 
in developing this data  certain estimates and assumptions are used  including among other things  discount rate  long term rates of return and mortality tables 
changes in any of these estimates could materially affect the amounts recorded that are related to our defined benefit retirement plan 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board accounting standards update fasb asu  consolidations topic 
this fasb asu replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate a variable interest entity vie with a qualitative approach focused on identifying which enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity 
in addition  fasb asu requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
fasb asu was effective for our company s fiscal year beginning november  and as a result  our company analyzed its variable interest in hm east ridge  llc east ridge 
our company determined that east ridge is a vie  but because our company is not the primary beneficiary it is not required to consolidate east ridge in its financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb asu  fair value measurement topic 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amends asc  fair value measurement 
the amended guidance changes the wording used to describe many requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
additionally  the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the guidance provided in asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the provisions are effective for our company s second quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
fasb asu  comprehensive income topic 
in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will only impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and will have no impact on the reported results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk borrowings under each of the rabobank credit facility  farm credit west term loans and the farm credit west line of credit are or will be subject to variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates subject us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in interest rates 
our borrowing interest rate for the rabobank line of credit is a libor based rate plus a spread 
under the farm credit west term loans and the farm credit west line of credit  our borrowing interest rate is an internally calculated rate based on farm credit west s internal monthly operations and their cost of funds and generally follows the changes in the day treasury rates in increments divisible by
