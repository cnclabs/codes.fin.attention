table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a global contract research and manufacturing organization that provides customers fully integrated drug discovery  development  and manufacturing services 
we supply a broad range of services and technologies that support the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products and the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients api and drug product for existing and experimental new drugs 
with locations in the united states  europe  and asia  we maintain geographic proximity and flexible cost models 
we have also historically leveraged our drug discovery expertise to execute on several internal drug discovery programs  which have progressed to the development candidate stage and in some cases into phase i clinical development 
we have successfully partnered certain programs and are actively seeking to out license our remaining programs to strategic partners for further development 
we continue to integrate our research and manufacturing facilities worldwide  increasing our access to key global markets and enabling us to provide our customers with a flexible combination of high quality services and competitive cost structures to meet their individual outsourcing needs 
our service offerings range from early stage discovery through manufacturing and formulation across us  europe and asia 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider is of significant benefit to our customers as we are able to provide them with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
compounds discovered and or developed in our contract research facilities can then be more easily transitioned to production at our large scale manufacturing facilities for use in clinical trials and  ultimately  commercial sales if the product meets regulatory approval 
additionally  with the acquisition of our burlington  ma facility  we now offer customers a fully integrated manufacturing process for sterile injectable drugs 
this includes the development and manufacture of the api  the design of the criteria to formulate the api into an injectable drug product  and the manufacture of the final drug product 
we continue to make investments to build and recover our formulation business  as we believe this type of business has significant potential in the drug product world driven by the growth in biologically based compounds which are formulated manufactured on an aseptic basis 
in addition to providing our customers our hybrid services model for outsourcing  we now offer the option of insourcing 
with our world class expertise in managing high performing groups of scientists  this option allows us to embed our scientists into the customer s facility allowing the customer to cost effectively leverage their unused laboratory space 
in  we made a decision to cease activities related to our internal proprietary compound discovery r d programs 
although we halted our proprietary r d activities  we continue to believe there are additional opportunities to partner our proprietary compounds or programs to create value  as we have seen a renewed commitment by pharmaceutical companies for innovation both internally and through licensing 
our goal is to partner these compounds or programs in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if any compound based on our intellectual property is successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business and million from royalties on sales of allegra telfast 
we used million in cash from operations  and we used million for capital expenditures on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to maintenance of existing facilities and international expansion 
we recorded a net loss of million in  largely the result of a million goodwill impairment charge  a million long lived asset impairment charge  a million restructuring charge and a million intangible impairment charge 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt 

table of contents results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates  sterile syringe and vial filling  and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing 
api manufacturing is performed at our rensselaer  ny  wales  uk and aurangabad  in facilities 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for our dds and lsm segments were as follows

year ended december  in thousands dds    lsm    total    dds contract revenues decreased for the year ended december  from the same period in primarily due to lower contract revenue from our discovery services of million  offset in part by an increase in our development and small scale manufacturing services of million 
the decrease in discovery services contract revenue was primarily due to lower demand for our us medicinal chemistry services  partially offset by higher demand for our discovery services at our asia locations 
the increases in contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services were attributable to higher demand for our chemistry development services 
we currently expect dds contract revenue for full year to remain flat from amounts recognized in lsm contract revenue increased for the year ended december  from the same period in as a result of higher commercial and api development manufacturing shipments from our rensselaer  ny facility  as well as increased intermediate manufacturing in our aurangabad  india facility as compared to the same period in we currently expect lsm contract revenue for full year to increase from amounts recognized in  including an increase in revenues from our burlington  ma facility during the second half of dds contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the same period in this result was primarily due to a decrease in contract revenue caused by lower demand from specialty pharma biotech customers for our us services  offset in part by the acquisition of amri uk along with higher demand for these services at our international locations  including an increased demand for our in vitro biology services worldwide 
lsm contract revenue for the year ended december  increased from the same period in primarily due to incremental revenues from the amri uk and amri burlington acquisitions that took place in the first half of additionally  sales of commercial products increased million  primarily due to an increase in commercial sales to lsm s largest customer  as such customers returned toward historical levels after reducing their purchases from us in in an effort to reduce their inventory levels 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of million related to reduced demand for the production of clinical supply materials 

table of contents recurring royalties we earn royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi 
royalties were as follows

year ended december  in thousands recurring royalties are based on the worldwide sales of allegra telfast  as well as on sales of sanofi s over the counter otc product and authorized generics 
recurring royalties slightly increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to a significant increase in sales of prescription allegra in japan  partially offset by a decrease in royalties recognized from the sale of allegra products in the us we currently expect full year recurring royalties to remain flat with amounts recognized in we are anticipating recurring royalties in the first half of to decrease from amounts recognized in the same period of due to the timing of the otc product launch in the us in we are anticipating recurring royalties to increase in the second half of from amounts recognized in the same period of as amounts in were impacted by prescription inventory reductions and marketing incentives associated with the otc launch 
recurring royalties remained flat for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings and operating cash flows 
we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
milestone revenue milestone revenue is earned for achieving milestones included in licensing and research agreements with certain of our partners 
milestone revenues were as follows

year ended december  in thousands milestone revenue of million received during the year ended december  was recognized in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms and was specifically based on meeting a phase ii clinical trial milestone of an amri compound licensed exclusively to bms 
no milestone revenue was recorded during the year ended december  during the year ended december   milestone revenue of million was recognized in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
million was recognized as a result of the submission of a clinical trial application and an additional million was recognized for advancing a third compound into preclinical development

we currently expect dds contract margins for to improve over amounts recognized in due to cost reduction actions implemented in the us in along with the impact of the anticipated sale or closure of our hungarian operations 
lsm s contract revenue gross margin slightly decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily due to levels of fixed cost base at our burlington  ma facility as compared to its revenues due to the disruption at the facility resulting from the fda warning letter received in august  along with unutilized capacity at our amri uk facility 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in margins for our us api manufacturing services 
we currently expect lsm contract margins for to improve from amounts recognized in driven by higher revenues discussed above in relation to our fixed costs 
dds contract revenue gross margin decreased for the year ended december  from the same period in this decrease resulted from lower demand for our u

lsm s contract revenue gross margin decreased for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to lower revenues at our burlington facility in relation to its fixed cost base due to the pending resolution of its fda warning letter  along with unutilized capacity at our amri uk facility 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology developments by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor or made a significant intellectual contribution 
to date  the royalties from allegra are the main driver of the awards 
accordingly  as the creator of the technology  the award is currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  our chief executive officer and president of the company

table of contents we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
technology incentive award expense for the years ended december  remained consistent as compared to and  which reflects the relative consistency in royalty revenue 
research and development research and development r d expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology r d projects  costs of chemicals  materials  outsourced activities and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s board of directors made a decision to cease activities related to its internal discovery research and development programs  excluding its generic program 
although we ceased our proprietary r d activities  we continue to believe there are additional opportunities to partner our proprietary compounds in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  r d activities continue at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses were as follows

year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to an overall decrease in internal operating costs as we strategically managed our r d investments and continued to narrow the focus of r d spending on those programs with the highest licensing potential  as well as a decrease in clinical trial costs related to our oncology and obesity programs 
based on our strategic decision to cease r d operations  we currently expect r d expense to reduce to approximately million  with costs related to developing new niche generic products and improving process efficiencies in our manufacturing plants 
research and development expenses decreased for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs in caused by a reduction of research and development scientific resources and lower material costs  as we managed our costs by focusing on moving only our most advanced programs forward 
additionally  in we recognized an increase in process r d related to both improving the manufacturing process for our generic api products as well as the manufacturing process for our oncology compound  which was in phase i clinical trials

year ended december  in thousands during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our dds operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value 
the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to significantly lower than forecasted demand for contract services in the current year  which resulted in a decrease in management s long term estimates of operating results and cash flows for the segment 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value during the fourth quarter of the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several events occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance for this segment 
our amri uk facility was notified of an unplanned elimination in demand for a key commercial product  which has historically represented a significant amount of annual revenues at the site 
in addition  the fda warning letter issued to our amri burlington facility was expected to have both continued negative short term financial impact during the remediation process  as well as delaying the planned integration of the amri burlington business into our overall lsm platform and the forecasted resulting growth in the long term 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value 
the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several issues occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance 
two phase iii products that were expected to receive fda approval were delayed  one by the fda requiring more information and one by the customer in an effort to proactively collect more data before submitting to the fda 
it was expected throughout that commercial manufacturing would commence on both these products at the amri rensselaer lsm facility beginning in in addition  the company was notified of additional unexpected reductions in demand for product under the commercial supply agreement with its largest customer 
these additional unplanned demand reductions in the fourth quarter of added an element of risk related to the company s ability to achieve the significant revenues expected from this contract that were reflected in the future projections for the segment

for  we expect to incur to million in capital expenditures primarily relating to maintenance of our existing facilities and expansion at our existing international facilities 
in june  we finalized the renegotiation of our credit agreement  which included repayment of million of the outstanding line of credit 
the remaining million of the outstanding line of credit was converted into a term loan with a maturity date of june and quarterly repayments of million 
the line of credit also secures our outstanding letters of credit which totaled million as of december  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and a minimum unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance 
other covenants include  but are not limited to  limits on quarterly capital expenditures 
additionally  in connection with the new debt agreement  the company provided security to the bank group in the form of a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets located in the united states 
as of september   we were not in compliance with one of the financial covenant requirements 
as a result  the we received a waiver from the lenders and additionally amended the above credit agreement effective november  the amended credit agreement increased the effective interest rate  limited any further borrowings  required that we diligently seek refinancing of this debt agreement with a commitment for such to be obtained by march  and required the further repayment of million in december and another million of such obligations in the first quarter of with the remaining outstanding balance to be repaid in june  on the loan s maturity date 
in addition  certain of the restrictive covenants were revised and as of such date we are only required to comply with certain cash maintenance requirements and to limit our capital expenditures 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the existing financial covenant requirements 
we are in the process of negotiating a year credit agreement with a new bank which would serve to replace the current line of credit 
while negotiations are proceeding in a positive manner  there is no assurance that we will be able to close this transaction on mutually acceptable terms 
the new agreement will have covenants that require the company to maintain minimum levels of cash  limit capital expenditures to historical amounts and require the company to achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
if the company is not able to finalize such new agreement  or if we fail to meet the terms of the new agreement  there could be a material and adverse effect on our business and operations 
in the event that the current bank group demanded immediate repayment of the term loan and cash collateralization of the letters of credit prior to the negotiation of the new agreement  the company would require additional financing in order to operate its ongoing business 
the company believes that such financing could be obtained from a variety of sources including borrowing from another lending institution  sale or securitization of assets  or sales by the company of equity or debt securities 

table of contents working capital was million at december   compared to million as of december  this decrease is primarily due to cash of used for the acquisitions of amri burlington and amri uk  million used for capital expenditures and million used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock

these uses were offset in part by million for net proceeds from investment securities 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock in the open market pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in june we expect that additional future capital expansion and acquisition activities  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods
