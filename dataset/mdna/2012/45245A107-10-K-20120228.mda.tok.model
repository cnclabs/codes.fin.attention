on january   the applicable margins for the eurodollar rate and the base rate became subject to adjustments based on average daily availability as defined in the amended credit agreement  as set forth in the definition of applicable rate in the amended credit agreement 
our us obligations under the amended credit agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of imation corp 
the guarantors and are secured by a first priority lien subject to customary exceptions on the real property comprising imation corp 
s corporate headquarters and all of the personal property of imation corp  its subsidiary imation enterprises corp  which is also an obligor under the amended credit agreement  and the guarantors 
advances under the us portion of the credit facility are limited to the lesser of a million and b the us borrowing base 
the us borrowing base is equal to the following up to percent of eligible accounts receivable  plus up to the lesser of percent of eligible inventory or percent of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory  plus up to percent of the appraised fair market value of eligible real estate the original real estate value  such original real estate value to be reduced each calendar month by th  provided  that the original real estate value shall not exceed million  plus such other classes of collateral as may be mutually agreed upon and at advance rates as may be determined by the agent  minus such reserves as the agent may establish in good faith 

table of contents our european obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the material personal property of the european borrower 
advances under the european portion of the credit facility are limited to the lesser of a million and b the european borrowing base 
the european borrowing base calculation is fundamentally the same as the us borrowing base  subject to certain differences to account for european law and other similar issues 
during the twelve months ended december  interest on borrowings under the amended credit agreement would have been at a variable rate of interest of approximately percent 
however  we did not have borrowings under the credit agreement during the amended credit agreement contains covenants which are customary for similar credit arrangements  including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification  payment of indebtedness  taxes and other obligations  compliance with applicable laws  and limitations regarding additional liens  indebtedness  certain acquisitions  investments and dispositions of assets 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  the amended credit agreement also contains a conditional financial covenant that requires us to have a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the amended credit agreement of not less than to during certain periods described in the amended credit agreement 
at december  the condition did not arise such that the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required as a covenant 
as of december   our total availability under the credit facility was million we had million of cash outside the us at december  we also have significant net operating loss carryforwards offset by a full valuation allowance in the us the calculation of a deferred tax liability on the repatriation of the cash outside the us is impractical 
however  because of the valuation allowance in the us  we do not believe there would be any significant impact to earnings if we were to remit this foreign held cash 
our liquidity needs for include the following restructuring payments of approximately million to million  litigation settlement payments of million  capital expenditures of approximately million to million  pension funding of approximately million to million  operating lease payments of approximately million  any amounts associated with strategic acquisitions  any amounts associated with organic investment opportunities and any amounts associated with the repurchase of common stock under the authorization discussed above 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowings under our current sources of financing  will provide liquidity sufficient to meet these needs and for our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are not using off balance sheet arrangements  including special purpose entities 
summary of contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations litigation settlements other liabilities total the majority of the purchase obligations consist of day rolling estimates 
in most cases  we provide suppliers with a three to six month rolling forecast of our demand 
the forecasted amounts are generally not binding on us 
however  it may take up to days from the purchase order issuance to receipt  depending on supplier and inbound lead time 
effective december   we began an agreement with a third party to outsource certain aspects of our information technology support 
while the agreement is cancelable at any time with certain cash penalties  our obligation through the expected termination date of january is included above 

table of contents timing of payments for the vast majority of other liabilities cannot be reasonably determined and  as such  have been included in the more than years category 
this amount includes million of reserves for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties and the long term fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of million 
the table above does not include payments for non contributory defined benefit pension plans 
it is our general practice  at a minimum  to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable benefits laws and local tax laws 
from time to time  we contribute additional amounts  as we deem appropriate 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our pension plans in and have million recorded in other liabilities related to pension plans as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to the extent necessary 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered in the future 
a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent we conclude a deferred tax asset is not considered to be more likely than not to be realized 
we consider all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized significant restructuring charges related to our us operations 
due to these charges and cumulative losses incurred in recent years  we were no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets would be fully realized 
therefore  during  we recorded a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million related to our us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance charge in is included in income tax provision on our consolidated statement of operations 
in we have concluded that it is necessary to maintain a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
the accounting estimate for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
a valuation allowance established or revised as a result of our assessment is recorded 
table of contents through income tax provision benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions 
these deferred tax assets are net of valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to our us deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized in the future 
our income tax returns are subject to review by various us and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we record accruals for items that we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities 
the threshold for recognizing the benefit of a tax return position in the financial statements is that the position must be more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties described below 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
the other million of unrecognized tax benefit would reduce income tax expense  but would be offset by an increase in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the reversal of accrued interest and penalties would affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
our us federal income tax returns for through remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions  or state and city tax jurisdictions for years before in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly during the next twelve months due to the resolution of certain us and international tax uncertainties  however it is not possible to estimate the potential change at this time 
litigation 
we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  we believe that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including intangibles  at fair value 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized based on a pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed  typically with useful lives ranging from one to years 
the initial recognition of intangible assets  the determination of useful lives and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
we evaluate assets on our balance sheet  including such intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors such as unfavorable variances from forecasted cash flows  established business plans or volatility inherent to external markets and industries may indicate a possible impairment that would require an impairment test 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses  which in many cases require subjective judgments concerning estimates  could result in significant impairment losses 
the test for impairment requires a comparison of the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which 
table of contents the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
as of december   we had million of definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization 
due to additional losses  particularly in the us  an impairment test was triggered and completed as of december   and no impairment was noted to exist 
given our intangible assets have remaining useful lives of more than years  and our operating segment cash flows which excludes cash used by our corporate segment remain sufficient over the projection period  our total estimated undiscounted cash flows well exceed our carrying value of intangible assets 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 
goodwill 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value 
the initial recognition of goodwill and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is considered impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned to its carrying amount 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
this involves measuring the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities both recognized and unrecognized at the time of the impairment test 
the difference between the reporting unit s fair value and the fair values assigned to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
our reporting units for goodwill are our operating segments americas  europe  north asia and south asia with the exception of the americas segment which is further divided between the americas consumer  americas commercial and mobile security reporting units as determined by sales channel 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of the mobile security reporting unit to its carrying value step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used the income approach  a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
in determining the fair value of the mobile security reporting unit under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
a discount rate of percent was used to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for this reporting unit 
an increase in the discount rate of one percent would have decreased the reporting unit s fair value by approximately million while a decrease in the discount rate by one percent would have increased the reporting unit s fair value by million 
the revenue growth rates in through are significant assumptions within the projections 
if revenue were decreased percent for each year without a change in projected sg a costs or other cash flows  the indicated fair value of the reporting unit would be reduced by approximately million 
the indicated excess in fair value over carrying value of the mobile security reporting unit in step one of the impairment test at november  and goodwill is as follows goodwill reporting unit carrying amount excess of fair value over carrying amount percentage of fair value over carrying amount in millions mobile security while this analysis indicates that this goodwill is not impaired  to the extent that actual results or other assumptions about future economic conditions or potential for our growth and profitability in this business changes  it is possible that our conclusion regarding the remaining goodwill could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
during our reporting units for goodwill were our operating segments americas  europe  asia pacific  
table of contents and electronic products with the exception of the americas segment which was further divided between the americas consumer and americas commercial reporting units as determined by sales channel 
during the second quarter of we realigned our corporate segments and reporting structure and combined our electronic products segment with our americas segment  and we separated our asia pacific segment into north asia and south asia regions 
as a result of the segment change  the goodwill of million which was previously allocated to the electronics products segment was merged into the americas consumer reporting unit 
the americas consumer reporting unit had a fair value that was significantly less than its carrying amount prior to the combination  which is a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test 
a two step impairment test was performed to identify a potential impairment and measure an impairment loss to be recognized 
based on this step of the impairment test  we determined that the full amount of remaining goodwill  million  was impaired 
excess inventory and obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for excess  slow moving and obsolescence to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
as of december   the estimated inventory write downs for excess inventory and obsolescence for inventory on hand was million 
rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  included in other current liabilities 
this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
restructuring reserves 
employee related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans 
generally  these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the board approves the associated actions  the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable 
in the event that the board approves the associated actions post the balance sheet date  but ultimately confirms the existence of a probable liability as of the balance sheet date  a reasonable estimate of these charges are recorded in the period in which the probable liability existed 
this estimate takes into account all information available as of the date the financial statements are issued 
severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods 
copyright levies 
in many european union eu member countries  the sale of recordable optical media is subject to a private copyright levy 
the levies are intended to compensate copyright holders for fair compensation for the harm caused by private copies made by natural persons of protected works under the european copyright directive  which became effective in directive 
levies are generally charged directly to the importer of the product upon the sale of the products 
payers of levies normally remit levy payments to collecting societies which in turn distribute funds to copyright holders 
levy systems of eu member countries must comply with the directive  but individual member countries are responsible for administering their own systems 
since implementation  the levy systems have been the subject of numerous litigation and law making activities 
on october   the european court of justice ecj ruled that fair compensation is an autonomous european law concept that was introduced by the directive and must be uniformly applied in all eu member states 
the ecj stated that fair compensation must be calculated based on the harm caused to the authors of protected works by private copying 
the ecj also stated that the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to devices not made available to private users and clearly reserved for uses other than private copying is incompatible with the directive 
the ecj ruling made clear that copyright holders are only entitled to fair compensation payments funded by levy payments made by the company when sales of optical media are made to natural persons intending to make private copies 
based on this development  we began in withholding payments to various collecting societies of levies arising from professional or commercial sales 
notwithstanding our view that the ecj ruling was determinative  as of december   we continued to accrue a liability for all withheld levy payments in our financial statements 
since the october ecj ruling  quarterly we evaluated on a country by country basis whether i levies should be accrued on current period sales of professional or commercial sales and ii accrued  but unpaid  levies on prior period sales should be reversed 
our evaluation considers ongoing and cumulative developments related to levy litigation and law making activities throughout the eu 
if we determine a levy obligation is remote  in the period of such determination we discontinue accruing current period levies and reverse previously accrued  but unpaid amounts by reducing cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to reversal of prior year levy accruals 
on a quarterly basis  cost of goods sold was reduced by million  million  and million during the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively  due to reversal of prior year obligations that were determined to be remote 

table of contents since the directive was implemented in  we have paid approximately million in levies to various ongoing collecting societies related to professional and commercial sales 
based on the ecj s october ruling and subsequent litigation and law making activities  we believe that these payments were not consistent with the directive and should not have been paid to the various collecting societies 
at december   the recovery of some or all of these payments represent a gain contingency that has not met the required criteria for recognition in our financial statements 
there is no assurance that we will realize any of this gain contingency 
due to this significant amount of over payments to the various collecting societies  beginning in for some countries and for others  we have accrued and withheld payments of million  as of december   from the collecting societies pending resolution of the over payments of prior years 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december see note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the united states was percent at december   as compared with percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the us pension plan expense for  and was percent 
a reduction of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will increase united states net pension plan expense pre tax by million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the united states plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we used the rate of percent for and beginning in  the projected salary increase assumption was not applicable in the united states due to the elimination of benefit accruals as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this change in benefits 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the irs static mortality table 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised standard intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of this revised standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance to enhance comparability between entities that report under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
this guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  
table of contents the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
regardless of whether one or two statements are presented  an entity is required to show reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
on december   the fasb amended this guidance to indefinitely defer provisions which require entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning january  the adoption of this guidance will only change the presentation of our consolidated statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
in may  the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
this guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning january  we do not expect these disclosures to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a variety of proposed potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies 
due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards  management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
