such factors include  among other things  the risks and uncertainties identified by us under the heading risk factors in item a of part i 
furthermore  we operate in a continually changing business and regulatory environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot predict what these new risk factors may be  nor can we assess the impact  if any  of such new risk factors on our business or results of operations or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any of our forward looking statements 
undue reliance should not be placed on our forward looking statements 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to update our risk factors or to publicly announce updates to the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k to reflect new information  future events or other developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue we derive a significant portion of our net revenue from medicare  medicaid and managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce patient charges to the estimated cash receipts based on each program s principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are primarily based on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to ensure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
if the actual contractual reimbursement percentage under government programs and managed care contracts differed by from our estimated percentage  we project that our net accounts receivable and consolidated net income as of and for the year ended december  would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts characterized as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue 
we maintain a uniform policy whereby patient account balances are characterized as charity and indigent care only if the patient meets certain percentages of the federal poverty level guidelines 
local hospital personnel and our collection agencies pursue payments on accounts receivable from patients who do not meet such criteria 
we monitor the levels of charity and indigent care provided by our hospitals and other health care facilities and the procedures employed to identify and account for those patients 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals and other health care facilities provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion of the bill is determined by the patient s individual health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to patients indicating the outstanding balances on their accounts 
if an account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in one of our business offices 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have been very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is used when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off as uncollectible shortly after they are returned to us from the primary collection agency 
in certain circumstances  we may sell a portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to an unrelated third party 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
when considering the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  accounts receivable balances are routinely reviewed in conjunction with health care industry trends indicators  historical collection rates by payor  aging reports and other business and economic conditions that might reasonably be expected to affect the collectibility of patient accounts 
we believe that our principal risk of collection continues to be uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
if our actual collection rate changed by from the estimated percentage that we used  we project that our allowance for doubtful accounts and consolidated net income as of and for the year ended december  would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively 
although we believe that our existing allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policies for all payor classes are appropriate and responsive to both the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor cash collections  accounts receivable agings and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  general economic conditions or federal and state government health care coverage  including the effects of the health care reform act  could each have a material adverse effect on our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations and could result in accounting policy modifications in the future 
of the accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing  a small percentage may convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for potential denial and are reclassified as appropriate 
third party payor and self pay balances  as a percent of total gross billed accounts receivable  are summarized in the tables below 
december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals 
table of contents accounts receivable are reserved at increasing percentages as they age 
all accounts are reserved when they age days from the date of discharge 
in addition to days sales outstanding  which is discussed below under liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures  we use other factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in that regard  we compare subsequent cash collections to net accounts receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also review the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percent of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for emerging trends in our accounts receivable portfolio 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be fully recoverable eg  advances in technology  deteriorating operating results  excess capacity  obsolescence  etc the determination of possible impairment of assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
estimates of fair value are based on recent sales of similar assets  market analyses  pending disposition transactions and market responses based on discussions with  and offers received from  potential buyers 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our continuing operations during the years ended december   and  however  as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized long lived asset charges of approximately million and million in discontinued operations during and  respectively 
goodwill 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis ie  each october and whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing goodwill impairment tests prior to  we initially compared the estimated fair values of each reporting unit s net assets  including allocated home office net assets  to the corresponding carrying amounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units were determined using a market approach methodology based on net revenue multiples 
we also considered a valuation methodology using discounted cash flows and a market approach valuation methodology based on comparable transactions 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s net assets was less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determined the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  compared such fair value to the corresponding carrying amount and  if necessary  recorded a goodwill impairment charge 
during september  the financial accounting standards board amended the accounting standards in gaap as they relate to the annual test for goodwill impairment the goodwill update 
the goodwill update allows  but does not require  an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for the purpose of determining if detailed quantitative goodwill impairment testing is necessary 
we elected to early adopt the goodwill update in connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing on october  our adoption of the goodwill update did not have a material impact on our annual goodwill impairment testing or the results therefrom 
specifically  the qualitative factors reviewed by us did not reveal any circumstances whereby detailed quantitative goodwill impairment testing was necessary at the reporting unit level 
there were no goodwill impairment charges in continuing operations during the years ended december   and  however  as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in discontinued operations during we do not believe that any of our reporting units are currently at risk of incurring a goodwill impairment charge 
qualitative assessments of our reporting units are based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but are ultimately unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions when allocating home office assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
changes in the estimates  assumptions and other qualitative factors used to conduct goodwill impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of our goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 
however  after consideration of the relevant gaap aggregation rules  we determined that our goodwill impairment testing should be performed at the divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 

table of contents income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and carrybacks will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any material valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the period ended december  we participate in the internal revenue service s compliance assurance program whereby our federal income tax returns will be audited on a concurrent basis 
the internal revenue service is currently auditing our income tax return for the year ended december  we make estimates to record tax reserves that we believe adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
professional liability risks as with most other health care providers  we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business 
we use our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and our risk retention group subsidiary  which are domiciled in the cayman islands and south carolina  respectively  to self insure a significant portion of our professional liability risks 
those subsidiaries  which are collectively referred to as the insurance subsidiaries  provide i claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and other health care facilities and ii occurrence basis coverage to most of our employed physicians 
to mitigate the exposure of the self insured program covering the hospitals and other health care facilities  the insurance subsidiaries buy claims made reinsurance policies from unrelated third parties for claims above self retention levels of million or million  depending on the policy year 
the limits of liability provided by the insurance subsidiaries for each employed physician located outside of florida is generally million per claim and million in the aggregate  and the corresponding limits for physicians located in florida are  and  respectively 
our employed physicians not covered by the insurance subsidiaries generally maintain claims made policies with unrelated third party insurance companies 
our self insured professional liability reserves reflect estimates of all known indemnity losses  incurred but not reported indemnity losses and related incurred future loss expenses 
as of december  and  such discounted reserves  net of amounts estimated to be recoverable under reinsurance policies  were approximately million and million  respectively 
included in those amounts were million and million  respectively  of case reserves on reported claims 
historically  the average lag time between settlement of a claim and payment to the claimant is generally less than one month 
therefore  our total unpaid settled claim amount at the end of any reporting period is not significant 
our expense for professional liability risks includes i an estimate of discounted losses and loss expenses for the current year  including claims incurred but not reported  ii changes in estimates for losses and loss expenses from prior years based on actual claim development experience  iii interest accretion on discounted reserves  and iv cumulative adjustments for changes in the discount rate  if any  during the year 
such expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  including million  million and million  respectively  relating to current year claim activity 
the year over year increases in our expense for current year claim activity reflect  among other things  organic and acquisition related growth in our business 
our reserves for self insured professional liability risks are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies 
the data used to develop such reserves is based  in part  on asserted and unasserted claim information that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system 
in the consolidated financial statements  these long term liabilities are recorded at their estimated present values using a discount rate of at both december  and we select a discount rate that represents a risk free interest rate correlating to the period when the claims are projected to be paid ie  a weighted average payment duration of approximately three years 
however  the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence to settlement interval that varies from our payment duration estimate 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our professional liability reserve requirements by approximately million 

table of contents for purposes of estimating case reserves  we use individual claim information  including the nature of the claim  the expected claim amount  payments made on the claim to date  the year in which the claim occurred and the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred 
once case reserves for known claims are determined  the data is stratified by loss layers and retention levels  accident years  reported years  geography and other key attributes 
several actuarial methods are applied to the data by us and our external actuaries on a semi annual basis to produce estimates of the ultimate indemnity losses and related loss expenses for both known and incurred but not reported claims 
such actuarial methods include i paid and incurred extrapolation methods  ii frequency and severity methods to estimate the ultimate average frequency number of claims and the ultimate average severity cost per claim  and iii bornhuetter ferguson methods that add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience 
each of these actuarial methods uses our company specific data  including historical paid indemnity losses and loss expenses that have been accumulated over a period of fifteen years  current and historical case reserves  actual and projected census data  employed physician information  our professional liability retention levels by policy year  geographic information  trends of loss development factors  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  coverage limits of unrelated third party insurance policies  and other relevant inputs 
we also consider pertinent industry data and changes in laws and regulations eg  tort reform  settlement caps  etc 
in the jurisdictions where our hospitals and other health care facilities operate 
we believe that using the aforementioned company specific data and other information enables us and our external actuaries to reasonably estimate i our ultimate indemnity losses and related loss expenses and ii the projected timing of the corresponding payments 
therefore  we further believe that discounting our self insured professional liability reserves is appropriate 
given the number of factors used to establish our reserves for self insured professional liability risks  we believe that there is limited benefit to isolating any individual assumption or parameter from the detail computational process and calculating the impact of changing that single item 
instead  we believe that the sensitivity of the estimates of such reserves is best reflected in the selected actuarial confidence level used in the computations 
in our actuarial modeling  we consistently used the central estimate  which generally approximates a confidence level at the th percentile 
utilizing a confidence level higher than the central estimate  while not representative of our best estimate  would reflect a reasonably likely outcome for the ultimate resolution of our known and incurred but not reported indemnity claims and related expenses 
for example  using a statistical confidence level at the th percentile in our actuarial model would increase our discounted net reserves by approximately million  or 
our reserves for self insured professional liability risks are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates due to  among other things  their inherently complex  long term and subjective nature  we believe that the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and reasonable 
however  if actual losses and loss expenses exceed our projections of claim activity and or the projected claim payment duration differs from our estimates  our reserves could be materially impacted 
other self insured programs we provide i income continuance to  and reimburse certain health care costs of  our disabled employees collectively  workers compensation and ii health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured  however  we purchase stop loss insurance policies from unrelated third parties to mitigate our exposure to catastrophic events and individual years with high levels of benefit claim activity 
we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based on historical loss experience and other information provided by our third party administrators 
the long term liabilities for workers compensation are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies and are discounted to their estimated present values 
we select a discount rate that represents a risk free interest rate correlating to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our net workers compensation liability by approximately million our net liability considers discounted receivables for amounts that are estimated to be recoverable under stop loss insurance policies 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the net liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable 
if the actual costs of these programs exceed our projections and or the projected period over which workers compensation benefits will be paid differs from our estimates  the net liabilities could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents loss contingencies we regularly review the status of our legal and regulatory matters and assess the potential financial exposure thereof 
if the potential loss from any claim  lawsuit or regulatory proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a reserve 
attorneys fees and other costs of defending our company in respect of claims  lawsuits and regulatory proceedings are expensed in the period such fees and costs are incurred  except for those amounts relating to our professional liability risks  which are discussed at note h to the consolidated financial statements in item significant judgment is required when determining probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
predicting the final resolution of claims  lawsuits and regulatory matters and estimating financial exposure requires consideration of substantial uncertainties and  therefore  the actual costs thereof may vary significantly from our estimates 
when making determinations of likely outcomes of legal and regulatory matters and the related financial exposure  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the nature of the claim including unasserted claims  the availability of insurance  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction where the matter is being adjudicated  input from in house and external legal counsel  the likelihood of resolution through alternative dispute resolution or other means and the current status of the matter 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and we may revise and adjust our estimates at that time 
adjustments to reserves reflect the status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other relevant information 
changes in our estimates of financial exposure for legal matters and other loss contingencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our material legal matters and other loss contingencies 
recent accounting standards updates see note e and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of recent accounting standards updates that we adopted during the year ended december  or that we will adopt during the quarter ending march  we do not believe that such new accounting guidance had or will have a material impact on us 
results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in item as of december   we operated hospitals by and through our subsidiaries with a total of  licensed beds in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  washington and west virginia 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information about one of our tennessee based hospitals with a lease agreement that will expire in may and will not be renewed 
also  see note for information about our pending acquisition of an equity interest in each of five oklahoma based general acute care hospitals and their related health care operations  which we plan to complete during the quarter ending june  the operating results of hospitals and other ancillary health care businesses that we acquire are included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition 
unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion excludes our discontinued operations  which are identified at note to the consolidated financial statements in item such discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations during the years presented herein  other than the following items i a loss of approximately million from the sale of riley hospital in meridian  mississippi and its related health care operations  ii  and long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  and iii a gain of million from the sale of equity interests in a limited liability company that owned and operated two of our general acute care hospitals 
during march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the health care reform act were signed into law by president obama 
the primary goals of the health care reform act are to i provide coverage by january  to an estimated to million americans who currently do not have health insurance  ii reform the health care delivery system to improve quality  and iii lower the overall costs of providing health care 
to accomplish the goal of expanding coverage  the new legislation mandates that all americans maintain a minimum level of health care coverage 
to that end  the health care reform act expands medicaid coverage  provides federal subsidies to assist low income 
table of contents individuals when they obtain health insurance and establishes insurance exchanges through which individuals and small employers can purchase health insurance 
health care cost savings under the health care reform act are expected to come from i reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement payments to health care providers  including hospital operators  ii initiatives to reduce fraud  waste and abuse in government reimbursement programs  and iii other reforms to federal and state reimbursement systems 
although certain aspects of the health care reform act have already become effective  it will be several years before most of the far reaching and innovative provisions of the new legislation are fully implemented 
while we continue to evaluate the provisions of the health care reform act  its overall effect on our business cannot be reasonably determined at the present time because  among other things  the new legislation is very broad in scope and there exist uncertainties regarding the interpretation and future implementation of many of the regulations mandated under the health care reform act 
additionally  the health care reform act remains subject to significant legislative debate  including possible repeal and or amendment  and there are substantial legal challenges to various aspects of the law that have been made on constitutional grounds  including an appeal currently pending before the united states supreme court a ruling is expected by july 
for further discussion of the health care reform act and its possible impact on our business and results of operations  see business sources of revenue in item of part i and risk factors in item a of part i 
during the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  we experienced net revenue growth over the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  of approximately 
such growth principally resulted from i our acquisition of a equity interest in each of three florida based general acute care hospitals with a total of licensed beds and certain related health care operations collectively  shands in july  ii our acquisition of two florida based general acute care hospitals with a total of licensed beds and certain related health care operations collectively  wuesthoff in october  iii our acquisition of a equity interest in a mississippi based general acute care hospital with a total of licensed beds and certain related health care operations collectively  tri lakes in may  iv our acquisition of six tennessee based general acute care hospitals and other ancillary health care operations with a total of licensed beds collectively  the mercy hospitals on september   v increased surgical volume attributable to physician recruitment and market service development eg  ambulatory surgical centers  robotic surgical systems  etc 
at certain of our hospitals and other health care facilities  vi more emergency room visits  which we believe were attributable  in part  to our dedicated focus on emergency room operations  and vii improvements in reimbursement rates that resulted primarily from renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers 
during the calendar year  we recorded a first time benefit of approximately million from the meaningful use measurement standard under various medicare and medicaid healthcare information technology incentive programs collectively  the hcit programs 
items that adversely affected our profitability during the calendar year included i increases in interest expense and costs for government investigations  ii million of write offs of deferred debt issuance costs and related other attributable to a debt restructuring that we completed on november  the debt restructuring  and iii expenses attributable to our acquisition of the mercy hospitals and related restructuring activities 
overall  our income from continuing operations increased during the calendar year by million  or 
our strategic operational objectives include increasing patient volume and operating margins  while decreasing uninsured underinsured patient levels and the provision for doubtful accounts 
our specific plans include  among other things  utilizing experienced local and regional management teams  modifying physician employment agreements  renegotiating payor and vendor contracts and developing action plans responsive to feedback from patient  physician and employee satisfaction surveys 
based on the needs of the communities that we serve  we also seek opportunities for market service development  including establishing ambulatory surgical centers  urgent care centers  cardiac cath labs  angiography suites and orthopedic  cardiology and neurology neurosurgery centers of excellence 
furthermore  we are investing significant resources in physician recruitment and retention primary care physicians and specialists  emergency room operations  advanced robotic surgical systems  replacement hospital construction and other capital projects 
for example  we continue to implement er extra  which is our signature patient centered emergency room program that is designed to reduce patient wait times  enhance patient satisfaction and improve the quality and scope of patient assessments 
during  we also opened a hospital that we built to replace madison county medical center in canton  mississippi and deployed new makoplasty and da vinci robotic surgical systems at many of our hospitals 
we believe that our strategic initiatives  coupled with appropriate executive management oversight  centralized support and innovative marketing campaigns  will enhance patient  physician and employee satisfaction  improve clinical outcomes and ultimately yield increased surgical volume  emergency room visits and admissions 
additionally  as we consider potential acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships in and beyond  we believe that continually improving our existing operations provides us with a fundamentally sound infrastructure upon which we can add hospitals and other ancillary health care businesses 

table of contents we have also taken steps that we believe are necessary to achieve industry leadership in clinical quality 
our vision is to be the highest rated health care provider of any hospital system in the country  as measured by medicare 
with our knowledgeable and experienced clinical affairs leadership supporting this critical quality initiative  we measure key performance objectives  maintain accountability for achieving those objectives and recognize the leaders whose quality indicators and clinical outcomes demonstrate improvement 
as most recently reported by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  all four of our core measure care areas have dramatically improved since the commencement of our clinical quality initiatives and we now rank second in core measures amongst for profit hospital systems 
additionally  the joint commission  a leading independent not for profit organization that accredits and certifies health care organizations in the united states  recently named nearly of our hospitals as top performers on key quality measures  which compares to a nationwide achievement rate of approximately 
the joint commission aggregated certain evidence based accountability data from  including core measurement performance data  to determine the top performers 
outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net revenue generated on an outpatient basis 
recognizing the importance of these services  we have improved many of our health care facilities to accommodate the outpatient needs of the communities that they serve 
we have also invested substantial capital in many of our hospitals and physician practices during the past several years  resulting in improvements and enhancements to our diagnostic imaging and ambulatory surgical services 
during the past several years  various economic and other factors have resulted in a large number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
self pay admissions as a percent of total admissions at our hospitals were approximately and during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
we continue to take various measures to address the impact of uninsured and underinsured patients on our business 
additionally  one of the primary goals of the health care reform act is to provide health insurance coverage to more americans 
nevertheless  there can be no assurances that our self pay admissions will not grow in future periods  especially in light of the prolonged downturn in the economy and correspondingly higher levels of unemployment in many of the markets served by our hospitals 
therefore  we regularly evaluate our self pay policies and programs and consider changes or modifications as circumstances warrant 
calendar year compared to the calendar year the tables below summarize our operating results for the calendar year and the calendar year 
hospitals that were owned leased and operated by us for one year or more as of december  are referred to as same hospitals 
for all year over year comparative discussions herein  the operating results of our same hospitals are only considered to the extent that there was a similar period of operation in both years 
years ended december  percent percent of net of net amount revenue amount revenue in thousands in thousands net revenue salaries and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts rent expense other operating expenses medicare and medicaid hcit incentive payments depreciation and amortization interest expense write offs of deferred debt issuance costs and related other other income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations 
table of contents calendar year compared to the calendar year continued years ended december  percent change change same hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions emergency room visits surgeries outpatient revenue percent bps n a inpatient revenue percent bps n a total hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions emergency room visits surgeries outpatient revenue percent bps n a inpatient revenue percent bps n a includes acquired hospitals to the extent we operated them for comparable periods basis points admissions adjusted for outpatient volume net revenue during the calendar year was approximately  million as compared to  million during the calendar year 
this change represented an increase of million  or 
our same hospitals provided million  or  of the increase in net revenue as a result of i increased outpatient and surgical volume from  among other things  market service development activities  ii an increase in emergency room visits  and iii improvements in reimbursement rates 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in hospital admissions  which was primarily due to a reduction in admissions of uninsured patients and certain weather related disruptions 
the remaining net revenue increase of million was due to our acquisitions of i shands in july  ii wuesthoff in october  iii tri lakes in may  and iv the mercy hospitals in september net revenue per adjusted admission increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
the factors contributing to such change included higher patient acuity  increased surgical volume and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year increased basis points to of net revenue as compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
this change was primarily due to amounts considered to be patient responsibility eg  deductibles  co payments  other amounts not covered by insurance  etc our consistently applied accounting policy is that accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue and  accordingly  such amounts have no impact on our provision for doubtful accounts 
however  as a measure of our fiscal performance  we routinely aggregate amounts pertaining to our i provision for doubtful accounts  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care and divide the resulting total by the sum of our i net revenue  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care 
we believe that this fiscal measure  which we refer to as our uncompensated patient care percentage  provides us with key information regarding the aggregate level of patient care for which we do not receive remuneration 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  our uncompensated patient care percentage was and  respectively 
this basis point increase during the calendar year primarily reflects greater uninsured self pay patient revenue discounts  partially offset by a decline in self pay patients in the mix of patients that we serve 

table of contents salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
during the calendar year  increased costs for routine salary and wage increases and disproportionately higher salaries and benefits at our recent acquisitions including restructuring activities at the mercy hospitals were mostly offset by cost containment measures such as flexible staffing and new hire limitations 
supplies as a percent of net revenue decreased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this decrease was primarily due to improved pricing and greater discounts from our group purchasing agreement and a favorable change in our surgical volume mix during the calendar year 
rent expense as a percent of net revenue increased during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year while depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of net revenue declined 
in recent years  we have entered into more operating lease arrangements 
as our use of operating leases has increased  depreciation and amortization expense has declined and rent expense has increased 
additionally  certain of our hospital buildings reached the end of their depreciable lives during  which further reduced depreciation and amortization expense in other operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with i the acquisition of the mercy hospitals  ii restructuring activities at the mercy hospitals  and iii certain government investigations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our recent acquisitions and our ongoing government investigations  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in other operating expenses were i higher state mandated provider taxes and increased repairs and maintenance costs during the calendar year  ii certain services at our hospitals that have been recently outsourced and or contracted to third parties  and iii disproportionately higher costs at our recent acquisitions 
during the calendar year  we recognized a first time benefit of approximately million under the meaningful use measurement standard of the hcit programs 
interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such increase was primarily due to non cash interest expense of million attributable to our interest rate swap contract ie  accumulated other comprehensive loss amortization and net fair value adjustment expense that was recognized after the debt restructuring on november  this increase was partially offset by a lower overall effective interest rate on our former billion seven year term loan because less of the outstanding balance thereunder was covered by our interest rate swap contract 
we also maintained a lower average outstanding principal balance on such term loan during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year and recorded a greater amount of capitalized interest during the calendar year 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt arrangements and interest rate swap contract 
as a result of the debt restructuring  we wrote off approximately million of deferred debt issuance costs and incurred million of related costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt and the debt restructuring 
our effective income tax rates were approximately and during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  which is not tax effected in our consolidated financial statements  reduced our effective income tax rates by approximately basis points and basis points during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively

table of contents net revenue during the calendar year was approximately  million as compared to  million during the calendar year 
this change represented an increase of million  or 
our same hospitals provided million  or  of the increase in net revenue as a result of increased surgical volume attributable to physician recruitment and market service development  as well as improvements in reimbursement rates 
these items were partially offset by decreases in hospital admissions and emergency room visits  as well as unfavorable movement in our payor mix 
among other things  hospital admissions and emergency room visits declined in due to i fewer births at our hospitals and ii a less severe flu season as compared to when there was an outbreak of hn influenza swine flu in the united states 
the remaining net revenue increase of million was due to our acquisitions of i the bed sparks health system sparks in fort smith  arkansas in december  ii shands in july  and iii wuesthoff in october net revenue per adjusted admission increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
the factors contributing to such change included increased patient acuity and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers  partially offset by the unfavorable movement in our payor mix during the calendar year 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year increased basis points to of net revenue as compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
this change was primarily due to an increase in uninsured patients in the mix of patients that we serve approximately and of total hospital admissions during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively  which can be attributed  in part  to the prolonged downturn in the economy and correspondingly higher levels of unemployment 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  our uncompensated patient care percentage  which is described above under the heading calendar year compared to the calendar year  was and  respectively 
this basis point increase during the calendar year primarily reflects greater uninsured self pay patient revenue discounts and unfavorable movement in our payor mix 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this increase was primarily due to disproportionately higher salaries and benefits at our and acquisitions 
supplies as a percent of net revenue decreased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this decrease was primarily due to improved pricing and greater discounts from our group purchasing agreement and a favorable change in our surgical volume mix during the calendar year 
rent expense as a percent of net revenue increased during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year while depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of net revenue declined 
see above under the heading calendar year compared to the calendar year for the factors contributing to these changes 
other operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this change was primarily due to an increase in attorneys fees and disproportionately higher operating expenses at our recent acquisitions 
interest expense decreased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such decrease was primarily due to a lower overall effective interest rate on our former billion seven year term loan because less of the outstanding balance thereunder was covered by our interest rate swap contract 
we also maintained lower average outstanding principal balances on such term loan and our convertible debt securities during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
these reductions in interest expense were partially offset by a lesser amount of capitalized interest during the calendar year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt arrangements 
during the calendar year  we repurchased certain of our convertible debt securities  which yielded a net gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures liquidity our cash flows from continuing operating activities provide the primary source of cash for our ongoing business needs 
additionally  at december  approximately million of our available for sale securities and million of borrowing capacity under our new million long term revolving credit facility were available for  among other things  general business purposes and acquisitions 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we plan to fund the pending acquisition of an equity interest in each of five oklahoma based general acute care hospitals and certain related health care operations with available cash balances and proceeds from sales of available for sale securities 
we believe that our various sources of cash are adequate to meet our foreseeable operating  capital expenditure  business acquisition and debt service needs 
below is a summary of our recent cash flow activity in thousands 
years ended december  sources uses of cash and cash equivalents operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net decrease in cash and cash equivalents calendar year cash flows compared to the calendar year cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased approximately million  or  during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
this increase primarily related to i improved profitability  including our receipt of million under the meaningful use measurement standard of the hcit programs  ii reductions in both our interest payments and our net federal and state income tax payments during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year  and iii increases in our accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  which were primarily due to our recent acquisitions 
partially offsetting the abovementioned favorable developments during the calendar year was an increase in accounts receivable at the mercy hospitals  which we acquired on september  prospectively  we believe that our cash flows from continuing operating activities will be adversely impacted through the middle of by delayed cash collections on accounts receivable at the mercy hospitals  however  our new million long term revolving credit facility  which is described under capital resources below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item  is available to provide post acquisition working capital  if necessary  while we await approvals to bill and collect under the medicare and medicaid provider numbers that we assumed see further discussion below under days sales outstanding 
we also believe that the professional and other costs of our ongoing government investigations  while difficult to predict  will continue and will vary throughout the duration of such investigations 
those costs will be paid with our cash flows from continuing operating activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding such government investigations 
although subject to change due to a variety of factors beyond our control  we project that during the year ending december  i we will pay million to the counterparties of our interest rate swap contract  which is discussed at note a to the consolidated financial statements in item  and ii we will receive additional reimbursement under the meaningful use measurement standard of the hcit programs ranging from million to million 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the calendar year included i approximately million of additions to property  plant and equipment  consisting primarily of new medical equipment including million to purchase da vinci robotic surgical systems  information technology hardware and software upgrades  renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and replacement hospital construction including a hospital that opened in may to replace madison county medical center in canton  mississippi and a new bed

see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our recent acquisitions 
excluding the available for sale securities in restricted funds  we had a net cash outlay of million from buying and selling such securities during the calendar year

these cash outlays were partially offset by i million of proceeds from the sale of riley hospital in meridian  mississippi  which is discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  and ii million of proceeds from sales of assets and insurance recoveries 
financing activities during the calendar year  we received approximately million of cash proceeds from a syndicate of banks  including million under a then existing revolving credit facility to i finance the acquisition of seven tennessee based general acute care hospitals and other ancillary health care operations from catholic health partners and its subsidiary mercy health partners  inc  ii pay certain closing costs of a credit agreement  which is described at note d to the consolidated financial statements in item  and iii provide start up working capital to certain of our subsidiaries that are affiliated with the newly acquired hospitals 
in connection with the debt restructuring  we received  million of proceeds from new debt arrangements  which was primarily used to repay all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under certain of our then existing debt agreements

partially offsetting these cash outlays were i million of cash proceeds from exercises of stock options and ii million that we received from noncontrolling shareholders to acquire minority equity interests in one of our joint ventures 
discontinued operations cash used by our discontinued operations during the calendar year was approximately million  including million of purchase price allocated from the abovementioned mercy health partners  inc acquisition 
the cash provided by our discontinued operations during the calendar year was million 
we do not believe that the exclusion of such amounts from our consolidated cash flows in future periods will have a material effect on our liquidity or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our discontinued operations 

table of contents calendar year cash flows compared to the calendar year cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities were approximately the same amount during the calendar year and the calendar year 
however  we experienced increased cash flows during the calendar year from i improved operating profitability and ii increases in our liabilities during the calendar year that were primarily due to the timing of vendor payments 
offsetting these items were i income taxes ie  net federal and state income tax payments of million and million during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively and ii an increase in accounts receivable from the hospital acquisitions that we completed during investing activities cash used in investing activities during the calendar year included i approximately million of additions to property  plant and equipment  consisting primarily of new medical equipment  information technology hardware and software upgrades  renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and construction of a hospital to replace madison county medical center in canton  mississippi  ii million for the acquisition of two florida based hospitals wuesthoff  iii million to acquire a equity interest in each of three florida based hospitals shands  iv million to acquire six ancillary health care businesses  and v a million increase in our restricted funds

cash used in investing activities during the calendar year included i approximately million of additions to property  plant and equipment  consisting primarily of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities  and ii million for the acquisition of a health system in fort smith  arkansas sparks 
excluding the available for sale securities in restricted funds  we had a net cash outlay of million from buying and selling such securities during the calendar year 
these cash outlays were partially offset by a decrease in restricted funds of million and million of proceeds from sales of assets 
financing activities during the calendar year  we made principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million 
we also paid million to noncontrolling shareholders primarily for recurring distributions 
partially offsetting these cash outlays were i million of cash proceeds from exercises of stock options and ii million that we received from noncontrolling shareholders to acquire minority equity interests in one of our joint ventures 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt arrangements and capital lease obligations  respectively 
during the calendar year  we borrowed and repaid million under our then existing revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of sparks 
furthermore  we made principal payments on our other long term debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million  including mandatory and other prepayments of million on certain then existing bank term loan indebtedness 
during the calendar year  we also paid i million to repurchase certain of our convertible senior subordinated notes due in the open market and ii million to noncontrolling shareholders  including distributions of million from our joint venture in north carolina and south carolina and million in connection with the restructuring of such joint venture 
these cash outlays were partially offset by million that we received from noncontrolling shareholders to acquire minority equity interests in our joint ventures and cash proceeds from exercises of stock options of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our joint venture activity 
discontinued operations cash provided by our discontinued operations during the calendar year and the calendar year was approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not believe that the exclusion of such amounts from our consolidated cash flows in future periods will have a material effect on our liquidity or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our discontinued operations 

table of contents days sales outstanding to calculate days sales outstanding  or dso  we initially divide quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net patient accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable  as well as our liquidity 
our dso was days at december   which compares to days at september  and days at december  at december   we were in the process of obtaining the necessary approvals for our medicare and medicaid provider numbers for the mercy hospitals and their related ancillary health care operations  which we acquired on september  while the necessary approvals are pending  we are unable to bill for the services that we provided at those facilities  which caused our accounts receivable to grow and correspondingly increased our dso by approximately two days at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our acquisition of the mercy hospitals 
our dso at december  was also adversely impacted by certain ongoing system and billing conversions that affect our accounts receivable software applications 
income taxes other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  we believe that it is more likely than not that reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and carrybacks will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to change as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
within the statutory framework of those programs  numerous areas are subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that could affect payments made to us 
in the future  federal and or state governments might i reduce the funds available under those programs to close budget gaps or reduce deficit spending or ii require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  the implementation of the health care reform act  which dramatically affects the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states  and or the continued prevalence of managed care health plans could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity

capital resources senior secured credit facilities 
as more fully described at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we completed the debt restructuring on november   which included  among other things  new variable rate senior secured credit facilities with a syndicate of banks the new credit facilities 
the new credit facilities consist of i a million five year revolving credit facility the new revolving credit agreement  ii a million five year term loan the new term loan a  and iii a billion seven year term loan the new term loan b 
we used the net proceeds from the term loans under the new credit facilities  together with the net proceeds from the sale of our senior notes due  to repay all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under certain of our then existing debt agreements 
we can elect whether interest on borrowings under the new credit facilities is calculated using libor or the prime rate as defined in the loan agreement as its base rate  however  the base rate for the new term loan b is subject to a floor of when the libor option is selected 
the effective interest rate  which fluctuates with changes in the underlying base rates  includes a spread above the base rate that we select 
the amount of the interest rate spread is predicated on  among other things  our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement 
we can elect differing interest rates for each of the debt instruments that comprise the new credit facilities 
interest is payable in arrears at the end of a calendar quarter or on the date that the selected interest duration period ends 
beginning on march   the new term loan a will be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the principal amount thereof in each of the first two years of such facility  in the third year  in the fourth year and in the fifth year 
the new term loan b requires quarterly principal payments of million  beginning on march   and a balloon payment for the remaining outstanding balance at the end of the facility s seventh year 
we have the right to prepay amounts outstanding under the new credit facilities at any time without penalty  other than a prepayment of the new term loan b  which is subject to a prepayment premium during the first year of the loan agreement 
at december   the effective interest rates on the new term loan a and the new term loan b were and  respectively 
those rates remained unchanged as of february  
table of contents throughout the new revolving credit agreement s five year term  we are obligated to pay commitment fees based on the amounts available for borrowing 
the new revolving credit agreement provides that we can borrow  on a revolving basis  up to an aggregate of million  as adjusted for outstanding standby letters of credit of up to million 
we did not borrow under the new revolving credit agreement during the period from november  to december  although there were no amounts outstanding under the new revolving credit agreement on february   standby letters of credit in favor of third parties of approximately million reduced the amount available for borrowing thereunder to million on such date 
our effective interest rate on the variable rate new revolving credit agreement was approximately on february  the new credit facilities are generally subject to mandatory prepayment in amounts equal to i of the net cash proceeds received from certain asset sales  including insurance recoveries and condemnation events  subject to reinvestment provisions and the ratable offer requirements of other pari passu secured debt  ii of the net cash proceeds from our issuance of certain new debt  and iii of our excess cash flow as defined in the loan agreement with step downs of such percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we intend to fund the required principal payments under the term loans of the new credit facilities and the related interest with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale securities and  if necessary  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
demand promissory note 
we maintain a million secured demand promissory note in favor of a bank for use as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the demand promissory note  we may borrow  on a revolving basis  up to the principal face amount of the note 
all principal and accrued interest under the demand promissory note will be immediately due and payable upon the bank s written demand 
we did not borrow under this credit facility during the calendar year 
the demand promissory note s effective interest rate on february  was approximately  however  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder on such date 
senior notes due as more fully described at note b to the consolidated financial statements in item  on november  we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
we used the net proceeds from this debt offering  together with the net proceeds from the term loans under the new credit facilities  to repay all of the principal and accrued interest outstanding under certain of our then existing debt agreements 
the senior notes are senior unsecured debt obligations that bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning on july  the senior notes mature on january  at which time the entire million of principal is due and payable 
at any time on or after january   the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
prior to january   we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus a make whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest 
prior to january   we may also redeem up to of the original principal amount of the senior notes with the proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we intend to fund the required semi annual interest payments under the senior notes with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale securities and  if necessary  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
debt covenants the new credit facilities and the indentures governing our convertible debt securities  the senior notes and our senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in those debt agreements 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
should we fail to comply with one or more of our debt covenants in the future and are unable to remedy the matter  an event of default may result 
in that circumstance  we would seek a waiver from our lenders or renegotiate the related debt agreement  however  such renegotiations could  among other things  subject us to higher interest and financing costs on our debt obligations and our credit ratings could be adversely affected 

table of contents dividends the new credit facilities and the indentures for certain of our other debt agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends 
standby letters of credit as of february   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties with various expiration dates through february  should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale securities and  if necessary  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
interest rate swap contract as required by a former credit facility  we entered into a seven year receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract during february as part of the debt restructuring  such credit facility was terminated but the interest rate swap contract was not 
although we are exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by one or more of the counterparties to the contract  we do not anticipate nonperformance because our interest rate swap contract is in a liability position and would require us to make settlement payments to the counterparties in the event of a contract termination 
the interest rate swap contract provides for us to pay interest at a fixed rate of on the contract s notional amount  which was originally expected to reasonably approximate the declining principal balance of a term loan under the former credit facility 
at december   the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract was approximately  million 
the estimated fair value of our liability for the interest rate swap contract on such date was million and we project that million will be payable to the counterparties during the year ending december  however  our aggregate payments through the contract s expiration in february  as well as the specific timing thereof  are subject to change based on  among other things  future libor rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap contract 
net interest payable or receivable is settled between us and the counterparties at the end of each calendar quarter 
we intend to fund any net interest payable to the counterparties with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale securities and  if necessary  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures and other we believe that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment will range from to of our net revenue before the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ending december   which is within the capital expenditure limitations of the new credit facilities 
as of december   we had started i construction of a bed general acute care hospital to ultimately replace the south campus facility at poplar bluff regional medical center in poplar bluff  missouri  ii several hospital renovation and expansion projects  and iii various information technology hardware and software upgrades 
additionally  we estimate that the remaining cost to build and equip a replacement hospital for walton regional medical center in monroe  georgia will range from million to million 
we are currently obligated to complete construction of this replacement hospital no later than december  we do not believe that any of our construction  renovation and or expansion projects are individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a material commitment of our resources 
part of our strategic business plan calls for us to acquire hospitals and other ancillary health care businesses in non urban communities that are aligned with our business model  available at a reasonable price and otherwise meet our strict acquisition criteria 
we fund acquisitions  replacement hospital construction and other recurring capital expenditures with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from sales of available for sale securities  amounts available under revolving credit agreements and proceeds from long term debt issuances  or a combination thereof 
specifically  we plan to fund the acquisition of an equity interest in each of five oklahoma based general acute care hospitals and certain related health care operations with available cash balances and proceeds from sales of available for sale securities 
this pending acquisition  which we expect to close during the quarter ending june   is discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents divestitures of idle property and other we intend to sell i the woman s center at dallas regional medical center  which was a specialty women s hospital in mesquite  texas that we closed on june   and ii the former riverside hospital campus that we acquired from mercy health partners  inc on september  we are also exploring various alternatives for st 
mary s medical center of scott county wherein the hospital s lease agreement expires in may and will not be renewed 
however  the timing of such divestitures has not yet been determined 
we intend to use the proceeds from any transactions involving the abovementioned facilities for general business purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information about the three facilities that we intend to divest 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had recorded approximately i million for redeemable equity securities and ii million as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we excluded these amounts from the table below due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such payments 
we also excluded million of net professional liability risk reserves including million in current liabilities from the table below because we do not characterize such reserves as contractual obligations and the unpaid settled claim amount at december  was not significant 
as of december   contractual obligations for each of the next five years ending december and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are summarized in the table below 
interest rates at december  were used in the table to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt 
payments due by year ending december  contractual obligations thereafter in thousands long term debt a capital leases operating leases b interest rate swap contract physician commitments c other total contractual obligations other commitments not recorded commitment expiration by year ending december  on our consolidated balance sheet thereafter in thousands letters of credit d physician commitments c other e total commitments a for purposes of the above table  we assumed that we would repurchase our convertible senior subordinated notes due on may  because the noteholders can unilaterally exercise their contractual right to require us to repurchase some or all of their notes on such date 
b amounts relate to obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to unrelated third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
c see note e and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
d amount relates to outstanding letters of credit that principally serve as security for our workers compensation self insurance program and deposits for certain utility companies

table of contents impact of inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when there exists a shortage of skilled labor 
a skilled nursing staff shortage throughout the health care industry has existed for the past several years and has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed our nursing staff needs by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
suppliers  utility companies and other vendors pass their cost increases to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to partially offset increases in our operating costs by increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and efficiently utilizing our resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases from our many vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
to mitigate our exposure to interest rate volatility  a portion of our long term debt is fixed rate and  if appropriate  we will consider entering into an interest rate swap contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our long term debt 
we do not believe that our overall market risk exposures will materially change during as of december   the estimated fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
the estimated fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt on such date were  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those that were in effect at december  would impact our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
moreover  increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase our interest expense associated with any future borrowings

b for purposes of the above table  we assumed that the interest rates on each of our variable rate long term debt instruments at december  would remain in effect for the full term of such instruments 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  pursuant to the requirements of the agreements underlying our former credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract in february that provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of such contract for its seven year term 
at december   the estimated fair value of the liability for our interest rate swap contract  which is discussed at note a to the consolidated financial statements in item  was approximately million
