strategic overview canterbury park holding corporation the company conducts pari mutuel wagering operations and hosts unbanked card games at its canterbury park racetrack and card casino facility the racetrack in shakopee  minnesota  which is approximately miles southwest of downtown minneapolis 
the company s pari mutuel wagering operations include both wagering on thoroughbred and quarter horse races during live meets at the racetrack each year from may until late summer and year round wagering on races held at out of state racetracks that are televised simultaneously at the racetrack simulcasting 
unbanked card games  in which patrons compete against each other  are hosted in the card casino at the racetrack 
the card casino  which was completely remodeled in  operates hours a day  seven days a week 
the card casino offers both poker and table games at tables  which is the maximum number of tables permitted by minnesota law 
the company also derives revenues from related services and activities  such as concessions  parking  advertising  publication sales and from other entertainment events held at the racetrack our three largest sources of revenues  card casino operations  pari mutuel operations and concessions sales  generate cash revenues 
consequently  the company is highly liquid and has not utilized its line of credit in over eight years 
the following summarizes our financial performance for the last five years 
financial performance summary net revenues operating expenses income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss the primary strengths of canterbury park are our dedicated and capable staff  our first class facilities located on acres of land including approximately acres of underutilized property and the legal authority to offer our unique gaming products in our market area 
our management team has extensive knowledge of the horse racing  card casino  and concession operations  and our staff has demonstrated a commitment to our customers 
we continue to implement improvements to our comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement and enhancement program 
our management team has a good relationship with our workforce and is able to retain qualified personnel as demonstrated by our low turnover rate 
our facilities are modern by racetrack industry standards  and we have invested heavily in the past few years to update and upgrade them to meet the needs of our customers and horsemen 
our acre site  in a prime location on the edge of the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area in one of the fastest growing counties in minnesota  provides us with great long term growth and development opportunities  and our board of directors regularly considers additional uses for underutilized portions of our property 
our long term strategic direction is to more fully develop our property as a unique gaming and entertainment destination 

table of contents we have a strong commitment to live racing and have been particularly successful in attracting new customers and providing a quality live racing experience for our horse racing fans as well as the horsemen who enter their horses in live races at canterbury park 
however  we still face a number of longer term challenges as we work to improve the results of our pari mutuel operations  including declines in handle and intense competition for racehorses with tracks that are able to subsidize their purses with non horse racing related gaming revenues 
we continue to believe that our best option for long term growth is to gain authority under minnesota law to offer additional gaming options  which would enhance horse racing with increased purses  provide growth and development opportunities and produce significant new tax revenues for state and local governments 
in addition  we believe that additional gaming options would provide significant job opportunities for the area 
the effort to obtain legislative authority for these initiatives has required  and will continue to require  substantial expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of political process  there can be no assurance that any bills favorable to the company s interests will be enacted into law  and it is possible  as a result of the legislative process  that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the company may be enacted into law 
operations review year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income  a gaap financial measure  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda each defined below  which are non gaap measures  for the years ended december  and ebitda represents earnings before interest income  income tax expense  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income as an indicator of our operating performance  or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry 
moreover  other companies that provide ebitda information may calculate ebitda differently than we do 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus material  one time non cash expenses 
during the year ended december   adjusted ebitda included the loss on disposal of assets during the remodel of our card room

the card casino is divided into two areas  the poker area and the table games area 
the average daily collection amount per game is dependent upon the number of tables utilized to offer the game 
patron demand determines the number of tables to be used for a specific game 
total card casino revenue increased  or  compared to the increase in card casino revenue is due primarily to the increase in table games revenue of  or  in over the company believes the rebounding economy and related increase in discretionary spending more than offset the negative impact from the government imposed shutdown of operations from july to july we expect that competition from running aces  illegal internet wagering  and wagering at tribal casinos will continue to challenge our efforts to grow our card casino operating revenues in future periods 
as a result  we continue to search for opportunities to make canterbury park the most attractive alternative when our customers want to wager on card games

operating expenses total operating expenses decreased approximately  or  to  in  from  in total operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to from in the primary factors contributing to these decreases are discussed in the following paragraphs 

table of contents total purse expense decreased  or  in compared to as presented in the table below 
as discussed in greater detail in item c iv above  minnesota law requires us to allocate a portion of amounts received from betting in the card room and wagering on simulcast and live horse races for future payment as purses for live horse races and other authorized uses 
while most of these amounts are paid into the purse funds for thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred races  minnesota law requires that a portion of such amounts allocated for purses be paid into the mbf 
a description of how the purse expense was derived from these three sources and allocated for purse funds and to the mbf is presented below 
the increase in card casino revenues in compared to resulted in the increases in card casino purse and mbf expense shown in the table below 
total purse expense associated with simulcast and live racing decreased in compared to primarily due to lower wagering levels 
purse expense minnesota breeders fund expense card casino simulcast racing live racing total under minnesota law  the company is required to pay of the first million of gross card casino revenues towards purses for live horse racing at the racetrack 
after meeting the million threshold  the company must pay of gross card casino revenues as purse monies 
of funds allocated for purses  the amounts paid are allocated to the purse funds and to the mbf 
the amounts paid to the purse fund for simulcast racing differ depending upon whether the simulcast wagering occurs during the racing season  a statutorily defined week period beginning in early may each year  or outside of the racing season 
we paid an average of of handle to the purse fund in both and we pay of pari mutuel simulcast commission revenues to the mbf  consequently  lower revenues result in lower mbf expense 
we also experienced a reduction in host fees of  or  in compared to primarily as a result of lower wagering due to the government imposed shutdown of operations that occurred from july to july  this decrease in wagering more than offset a rate increase imposed from numerous tracks around the country in salary and benefit expenses decreased by  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the government imposed shutdown that occurred from july to july  during the shutdown  the company was forced to furlough substantially all of its approximately  full time and part time employees 
a loss on disposal of assets in the amount of  was recorded during the year ended and related primarily to the remodeling of our existing card room 
there was no loss on disposal of assets during the year ended december  advertising expense decreased  or in compared to the decrease is primarily due to lower agency fees resulting from increased use of internal resources and decreased expenditures during the government imposed shutdown of operations from july to july  
table of contents other operating expenses increased  or  in compared to the increase is primarily due to increased expenditures in support of legislation that would authorize electronic gaming devices at the racetrack 
net other income decreased  or  in compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income on our primary bank account balance during income taxes as a percentage of pre tax loss and income decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in net income before taxes in compared to the higher than statutory income tax rate is due to the company s expenditures on non deductible lobbying expenses in pursuit of passing racino legislation 
net income increased  which resulted in net income for in the amount of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  as mentioned above  the primary reasons for this change was the loss on disposal of assets that during the first quarter of and the increase in card casino revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets at december  we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  we will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists 
stock based employee compensation asc  compensation stock compensation asc  requires recognition of employee services provided in exchange for a share based payment based on the grant date fair market value 
we utilize our judgment in determining the assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted using a black scholes model 

table of contents contingencies in connection with the purchase of the racetrack  the company entered into an earn out promissory note dated march  in accordance with the earn out note  if i off track betting becomes legally permissible in the state of minnesota and ii we begin to conduct off track betting with respect to or in connection with its operations  we will be required to pay to the imr fund  lp the greater of  per operating year as defined  or of the net pretax profit as defined  for each of five operating years 
at this time  we believe that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met and that we will be required to pay these amounts is remote 
at the date if any that these two conditions are met  the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the of net pretax profit calculation 
the first payment is to be made days after the end of the third operating year in which off track betting is conducted by us 
remaining payments would be made within days of the end of each of the next four operating years

management believes that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at december  and as of the date of this report will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
