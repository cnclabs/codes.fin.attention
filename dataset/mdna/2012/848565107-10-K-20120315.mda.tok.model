overview we develop  manufacture and market highly engineered products and services in three principal business areas i capital equipment and systems for the photovoltaic solar industry  ii biomedical and iii prior to the sale of the semiconductor business unit  optoelectronics  generally bringing to bear expertise in materials technologies  surface science and thin films across all three business areas  discussed below 
in the photovoltaic solar area  we develop  manufacture and market specialized equipment for the production of terrestrial photovoltaic modules from solar cells and provide photovoltaic systems for grid connected applications in the commercial markets 
our equipment has been installed in approximately factories in countries 
the equipment market is very competitive with major competitors located in japan and switzerland 
our flagship product is our sun simulator which tests module performance 
our other product offerings include turn key module lines and to a lesser extent other individual equipment 
to compete we offer other services such as training and assistance with module certification 
we also provide turn key services to our customers to backward integrate to solar cell manufacturing 
at times  we supply materials such as solar cells to certain customers 
in the biomedical area  we provide value added surface treatments to manufacturers of orthopedic and other medical devices that enhance the durability  antimicrobial characteristics or other material characteristics of their products  and perform sponsored research programs into practical applications of advanced biomedical and biophotonic technologies 
with respect to optoelectronics  on march   we completed the sale of our semiconductor business unit  which provides semiconductor foundry services  operates a semiconductor foundry and fabrication facility and provides services to the defense  medical  telecommunications and consumer products markets  to masimo corporation

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
the update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  entities must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the update will be effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe that the application of the provision of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  an amendment to fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurement 
the update revises the application of the valuation premise of highest and best use of an asset  the application of premiums and discounts for fair value determination  as well as the required disclosures for transfers between level and level fair value measures and the highest and best use of nonfinancial assets 
the update provides additional disclosures regarding level fair value measurements and clarifies certain other existing disclosure requirements 
the update will be effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption prohibited 
we do not believe that the application of the provision of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
manufacturing equipment and solar systems are generally quoted  manufactured and shipped within a cycle of approximately nine months  allowing for orderly pricing adjustments to the cost of labor and purchased parts 
we have not experienced any negative effects from the impact of inflation on long term contracts 
our service business is not expected to be seriously affected by inflation because its procurement production cycle typically ranges from two weeks to several months  and prices generally are not fixed for more than one year 
research and development contracts usually include cost escalation provisions 
foreign currency fluctuation we sell almost exclusively in us dollars  generally against an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit through a major united states bank 
accordingly  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current sales orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on our customers access to us dollars and on the pricing competition on certain pieces of equipment that we sell in selected markets 
we bear the risk of any currency fluctuations that may be associated with these commitments 
we attempt to hedge known transactions when possible to minimize foreign exchange risk 
we had no hedging activity in and foreign exchange gain loss included in other expense  net was a gain of approximately thousand and a loss of approximately thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
related party transactions on november   we entered into a new lease agreement the bedford lease with spi trust  a trust of which roger g 
little  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of the company  is the sole trustee and principal beneficiary  with respect to  square feet of space comprising the entire building in which we have occupied space since december  the term of the bedford lease commenced on december  and was originally set to expire on november  the annual rental rate for the first year of the bedford lease was per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increased on each anniversary by per square foot 
on september   we entered into the first amendment to lease agreement with spi trust to amend the bedford lease 
the term of the bedford lease was extended for an additional five years to expire on november  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term december  through november  is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
after the first year of the extended term of the bedford lease  the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
we have the right to further extend the term of the bedford lease for an additional five year period 
if we exercise this right to further extend the term of the bedford lease  the annual rental rate for the first year of the further extended term will be the greater of a the rental rate in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the extended term  or b the market rate at such time  and on each anniversary of the commencement of the extended term the rental rate will increase by per square foot 
additionally  spitrust agreed to reimburse us up to thousand for all costs incurred by us in connection with any alterations or improvements to the premises or repairs or replacements to the heating and air conditioning systems 
we believe that the terms of the bedford lease  as amended  are commercially reasonable 
rent expense under the bedford lease was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
on august   we entered into a new lease agreement the hudson lease with spi trust  with respect to thousand square feet of space comprising the entire building in which spire semiconductor has occupied space since june  the term of the hudson lease commenced on september   and was to continue for seven years until august  the annual rental rate for the first year of the hudson lease is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
in addition  we were required to deposit with spi trust thousand as security for performance by the company for its covenants and obligations under the hudson lease 
spi trust is responsible  at its sole expense  to make certain defined tenant improvements to the building 
we believe that the terms of the hudson lease were commercially reasonable and reflective of market rates 
the hudson lease is classified as a related party operating lease 
rent expense under the hudson lease was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with sale of the semiconductor business unit  the lease was terminated on march  and we were released from all future obligations under the lease as of that date

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation and warranty reserves 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from continuing operations from three primary sources commercial products including  but not limited to  solar energy manufacturing equipment  solar energy systems and solar energy materials  biomedical and semiconductor processing services  and united states government funded research and development contracts we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
our oem original equipment manufacturer capital equipment solar energy business builds complex customized machines to order for specific customers 
most orders are sold on a fob bedford  massachusetts or ex works factory basis and other orders are sold on a carriage and insurance paid or cip  or on rare situations  a delivery duty unpaid or ddu basis 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for this equipment when title of the product has passed to the customer  provided that customer acceptance is obtained prior to shipment and the equipment is expected to operate the same in the customer s environment as it does in our environment 
when an arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when those obligations are met or customer acceptance has been achieved 
typically  we are able to separate arrangements with multiple elements into more than one unit of accounting as it relates to the passage of title  training and installation services 
we allocate total fees under contract to each element using the relative selling price method and revenue is recognized upon delivery of each element 
our management performs extensive analysis to determine the relative selling price of each unit of accounting 
we allocate revenue in arrangements using our best estimate of selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence vsoe nor third party evidence tpe of selling price exists 
we determine estimated selling price esp of each deliverable based on a number of factors  including internal costs  gross margin targets and historical sales of similar units  as well as external factors such as market and competitive conditions 
our solar systems business provides photovoltaic systems for application to powering buildings with connection to the utility grid 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these systems as title passes  the customer accepts the system installation and interconnection to the grid is achieved 
our solar materials business supplies photovoltaic materials under a united states government contact 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for these materials as title passes and the government accepts the materials 
our biomedical business provides advanced medical device surface treatment processes for performance improvement of orthopedic devices 
it is our policy to recognize revenues from these services when services are provided to the customer 
our optoelectronics business provided wafer epitaxial growth services  compound semiconductor foundry services and device fabrication 
it is our policy to recognize revenues from these goods and services when title of the product passes to the customer or when services are provided 
on march   we completed the sale of this business to masimo corporation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues and estimated profits on long term government contracts on the accrual basis where the circumstances are such that total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
we accrue revenue and profit utilizing the percentage of completion method using a cost to cost methodology 
a percentage of the contract revenues and estimated profits is determined utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to complete on a contract by contract basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
some of the contracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage until such time as the united states government performs an audit of the cost incurred under the contract 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as it performs against the contract since we have not experienced any substantial losses as a result of audits performed by the united states government 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  amending the accounting standards for multiple element revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on how multiple deliverables that exist in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using esp of each element if a vendor does not have vsoe or tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require a vendor to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we applied the provisions of asc prospectively for applicable arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  the beginning of our fiscal year  which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
total net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were million with the application of asc and would have been approximately million had we not applied asc allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
we actively pursue collection of past due receivables as the circumstances warrant 
customers are contacted to determine the status of payment and senior accounting and operations management are included in these efforts as is deemed necessary 
a specific reserve will be established for past due accounts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we do not record an allowance for government receivables and invoices backed by letters of credit as realizability is reasonably assured 
bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified 
there is no dollar threshold for account balance write offs 
while rare  a write off is only recorded when all efforts to collect the receivable have been exhausted 
inventories and reserve for excess and obsolescence we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
impairment of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method for determining the fair value of stock option grants 
asc requires the fair value of all share based awards that are expected to vest to be recognized in the statements of operations over the service or vesting period of each award 
we use the straight line method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense for all stock option grants over the requisite service period 
warranty we provide warranties on certain products and services 
our warranty programs are described below we generally warrant solar energy module manufacturing equipment sold for a total of days  which include the replacement of defective component parts and the labor to correct the defect 
spire biomedical warrants that its services only will meet the agreed upon specifications 
spire semiconductor warrants that its products will meet the agreed upon specifications 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  determined primarily from historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
should actual product failure warranties differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not required as we are a smaller reporting company
