overview seacube container leasing ltd seacube or the company is one of the world s largest container leasing companies based on total assets 
containers are the primary means by which products are shipped internationally because they facilitate efficient movement of goods via multiple transportation modes including ships  rail and trucks 
the principal activities of our business include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of refrigerated and dry containers and generator sets 
the company leases our containers primarily under long term contracts to a diverse group of the world s leading shipping lines 
as of december   we employ people in seven offices worldwide and have total assets of billion 
as of december   we own or manage a fleet of  units  representing  teus of containers and generator sets 
for the year ended december   our average utilization was  as measured in units 
we plan to grow our business by maximizing the profitability of our existing fleet and making additional investments in new containers 
the tables below summarize the composition of our fleet by unit and teu as of december  equipment fleet by units refrigerated dry gensets total operating leases direct finance leases total owned managed total fleet equipment fleet by teus refrigerated dry gensets total operating leases direct finance leases total owned managed total fleet the table below summarizes the composition of our owned fleet by net book value as of december  container fleet by net book value refrigerated dry gensets total operating leases direct finance leases total fleet utilization excludes assets held for sale and new units at the factory 
segment reporting the company manages the business through a single set of product metrics and profitability measures that did not seek to allocate costs amongst the individual products 
we employ a single sales force that sells each product and the back office functions are not allocable in total or in part to a single product 
we expect to continue to operate our business as a single reportable segment 
sale of containers the sale on january   we entered into sale agreements with an unrelated third party investor group for the sale of approximately  containers and gensets for cash consideration of million 
the leasing assets sold had a book value of approximately million  and we also sold accounts receivable with a carrying value of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million which was recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the sale of these assets  cli entered into administrative services agreements  whereby  for a ten year term subject to a maximum year extension at the option of the container owner  cli has agreed to operate  lease and re lease the containers and to act on the owners behalf as so directed 
under the agreements  cli does not retain any risk of ownership 
the administrative services agreements are subject to an early termination right of the container owner if certain performance targets are not met as well as the requirement that cli maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million 
management fees will be paid by the owners to cli depending upon the type of lease that the equipment is under term  master lease or direct finance lease 
cli will collect lease receivables on behalf of the owners and remit amounts to the owners after deducting the applicable management fees 
these fees are recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the containers and gensets and associated lease interests that were sold in the sale were a representative sample of our total operating lease fleet with regard to equipment type  customer mix  age  and utilization 
the principal reasons why we entered into the sale were i to provide us with an opportunity to establish a new relationship with a third party capital provider  ii to allow us to mitigate some customer credit and residual risk of ownership to a third party  thereby reducing our aggregate risk exposure to several customers  and iii to provide us with additional revenue in the form of management fees from the long term administrative services agreements that cli entered into at the time of the sale

depreciation on new additions net of disposals and sales accounted for million of the increase  which was offset by a decrease of million due to equipment reaching the end of their depreciable lives 
provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december  we continued to have a strong credit and collections experience  which was due to the improved credit quality of our customer base along with our comprehensive credit underwriting and monitoring

we have provided adjusted results below that illustrate the impact of the sale on total revenues  direct operating expenses  total expenses  net income loss and adjusted net income as if it had occurred as of january  we made adjustments to equipment leasing revenue  finance revenue  other revenue  depreciation and direct operating expenses 
these adjustments were based upon actual data for each container that was sold in the sale 
we estimated management fees for the day period of january through january  based upon the actual results of the managed assets in interest expense associated with the sold units was estimated based upon proceeds available to reduce outstanding debt 
the adjusted results provided below are not a presentation made in accordance with us gaap  and they should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap 
the adjusted results are a measure of our operating performance used by management to focus on the consolidated performance exclusive of income and expenses relating to the sale 
we believe this non gaap measure provides additional insight and understanding to management and investors of our results of operations on a comparative basis in identifying trends in our performance by removing the operational impact of the containers that were subject to the sale 
our calculation of the adjusted results may differ from analogous calculations of other companies in our industry  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  the adjusted results should not be considered a measure of our consolidated results 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using the adjusted results only supplementally

as part of the sale  we sold  containers 
these units generated approximately million in equipment leasing revenue during the first days of the average on hire fleet increased by approximately  units which resulted in increased equipment leasing revenue of million 
most of the additional units were added in the third and fourth quarter of finance revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
during  amortization of the company s current lease portfolio exceeded new investments resulting in lower finance revenue of million 
additionally  the company took back approximately  units representing million of finance revenue 
the majority of these units have been re leased 
other revenue  which includes management fee revenues and re billable costs to our lessees  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to lower rebillable costs of million and by slightly lower management fee revenues of million 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the primary reasons for the decrease in direct operating expense was lower storage and positioning fees of million and lower maintenance and repair costs of million 
both of which are attributable to higher utilization and thus fewer units repaired and stored 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease is a result of lower employee expenses primarily compensation related of million 
this was offset by additional costs associated with the company s transition to becoming a standalone entity 
depreciation expenses depreciation of leasing equipment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the reduction of leasing equipment attributed to the sale reduced depreciation expense by million 
additionally  million of the decrease was related to equipment reaching the end of their depreciable lives and the sales of equipment in the normal course of business 
this was offset by million for depreciation on new equipment purchased in provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of collections and other reversals for accounts during the year ended december  that had previously been included in the provision

the majority of our impairments occur at the conclusion of an operating lease when our equipment is older and has incurred a certain amount of damage that the lessee is responsible for 
the decision to sell the container is based upon a discounted cash flow model which includes rebillable costs 
these rebillable costs are recorded as other revenues and are not recorded as a reduction in the impairment of leasing equipment held for sale 
in  we designated fewer units for sale in recognition of stronger market demand 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
in connection with the sale  we repaid the outstanding amount of million on our container asset backed securitization series notes  and reduced our series notes by million 
in addition  we paid swap related termination and modification fees of million 
this repayment along with regularly scheduled debt amortization reduced our weighted average debt balance for by million resulting in million reductions in interest cost 
we also benefited from lower average interest rates on our floating rate debt reducing interest by million 
in addition  our non cash interest expense was million lower in the current period 
this non cash interest included lower amortization on terminated derivatives of million  which was partially offset by higher losses recognized directly into income for ineffective derivatives of million 
interest income interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in the interest received from the million promissory note from the initial shareholder to cli 
in march  seacube operating company ltd assumed the obligation of the initial shareholder  which was treated as a non cash equity distribution to the initial shareholder 
loss on terminations and modification of derivative instruments in january  we incurred a one time loss of million on swap terminations and modification of derivative instruments 
upon completion of the sale  we extinguished the series notes of our container asset backed securitization for our containers sold  and terminated and modified the related swap agreements 
the one time terminations and modification of derivative instruments required us to recognize previously deferred losses in the value of the swaps 
for the year ended december   we did not terminate or modify any of our existing derivative instruments

the leasing assets sold had a total net book value of approximately million  and we also sold accounts receivable at the amount of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million or million net of tax

liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily from the following sources revenues including operating lease revenues  total finance lease collections  billings to lessors for repairs and maintenance  and asset management fees 
cash flows from operating activities including the principal collections on finance leases were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings  under which  million was outstanding and million was available for borrowing as of december  sales of our older leasing equipment  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that our cash flows from our operations  principal collections on direct finance leases  existing credit facilities and sales of older equipment will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
our current projections of cash flows from operations and the availability of funds under our revolving credit agreement are expected to be sufficient to fund our maturing debt and contractual obligations in the next several years 
we will need to borrow funds to finance the purchases of new assets we intend to buy to expand our business in the next few years 
no assurance can be made that we will be able to meet our financing and other liquidity needs as currently contemplated 
see risk factors our inability to service our debt obligations or to obtain additional financing as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity needs to acquire equipment to be leased the acquisition of leasing assets fuels our growth 
as a result  we expect to invest substantial funds to acquire containers and gensets  although there can be no assurances as to the timing and amount of such acquisitions 
since  we invested an average of approximately million per year in containers and gensets 
going forward  provided there is sufficient demand  production capacity  appropriate pricing and available financing  we intend to invest in containers at a level that is at least consistent with our historical investment activity 
as of february   seacube has committed to purchase approximately million of equipment for delivery through april of this amount  approximately million  or  has been committed to long term leases 
over the next several years  we expect that our single largest cash expenditure will be the purchase of containers 
in order to finance these expenditures  we will actively seek to enter into new debt facilities with greater borrowing capacity to expand and or replace our existing facilities  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional facilities 
we believe that we will be able to generate or otherwise obtain sufficient capital to support our replacement and growth strategy that will enable us to pay dividends to holders of our common shares as contemplated by our dividend policy 
however  deterioration in our performance  the credit markets or our inability to obtain additional financing on attractive terms  or at all  could limit our access to funding or drive the cost of capital higher than our current cost 
in addition  any equity financing we may seek could have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
these factors  as well as numerous other factors detailed above in risk factors  could limit our ability to raise funds  further the growth of our business or pay dividends

in addition  we had lower cash paid for interest of million

the primary financial covenants to which the company is subject to are as follows minimum consolidated tangible net worth tnw 
maximum consolidated indebtedness ratio to ebitda at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants 
commitments container purchase commitments the container purchase commitments are related to purchase orders we place for containers  both refrigerated and dry  and complementary equipment in the normal course of business 
we do not bear the risks and rewards of ownership and therefore have not recorded an asset or a liability related to these commitments 
we also had obligations to purchase containers of million at december  as of february   seacube has committed to purchase approximately million of equipment for delivery through april of this amount  approximately million  or  has been committed to long term leases 
operating leases we are a party to various operating leases relating to office facilities and certain other equipment with various expiration dates through minimum rent payments under our material leases were million as of december  inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business 
non gaap measure adjusted net income is a measure of financial and operating performance that is not defined by us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flow from operations  as determined in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted net income is a measure of our operating and financial performance used by management to focus on consolidated financial and operating performance exclusive of income and expenses that relate to non routine or significant non cash items of the business 
we define adjusted net income loss as net income before non cash interest expense related to terminations and modifications of derivative instruments  losses on retirement of debt  fair value adjustments on derivative instruments  loss on swap terminations  write offs of goodwill and gain on the sale 
we use adjusted net income to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non gaap measure is helpful to management and investors in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure helps management make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
adjusted net income provides us with a measure of financial performance of the business based on operational factors including the profitability of assets on an economic basis net of operating expenses and the capital costs of the business on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of certain non routine and non cash items from our operating results 
adjusted net income is a key metric used by senior management and our board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of the business 
adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool and is not a presentation made in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under us gaap  including net income  or net cash from operating activities 
for example  adjusted net income does not reflect i our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  or ii changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs 
in addition  our calculation of adjusted net income may differ from the adjusted net income or analogous calculations of other companies in our industry  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted net income should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to pay dividends 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted net income only supplementally 
the following table shows the reconciliation of net income loss  the most directly comparable us gaap measure to adjusted net income year ended december  net income loss non cash interest expense  net of tax loss on retirement of debt  net of tax loss on terminations and modifications of derivative instruments gain on sale  net of tax adjusted net income critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and re evaluate them on an ongoing basis 
those estimates form the basis for our judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our audited consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
although we believe the policies summarized below to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition our primary sources of equipment leasing revenue are derived from operating leases and revenue earned on direct finance leases 
revenue recognition equipment leasing revenue we generate equipment leasing revenue through short term and long term leases with shipping lines and ocean carriers 
in the majority of our transactions  we act as the lessor of leasing equipment for a specified period of time and at a specified per diem rate 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
revenue recognition direct finance revenue we enter into direct finance leases as lessor of equipment that we own 
in most instances  the leases include a bargain purchase option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term 
the net investment in direct finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
the lease payments are segregated into principal and interest components similar to a loan 
unearned income is recognized on an effective interest basis over the life of the lease term and is recorded as finance revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the principal component of the lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in finance leases 
revenue recognition other revenue other revenue includes fees that our customers are contractually obligated to pay to return equipment to a leasable condition as well as fees for third party positioning of equipment 
when a lessee leases equipment from us  the lessee is contractually obligated to return the equipment in a leasable condition according to predetermined standards 
upon redelivery of the units  we bill the lessee for the expected cost to repair the equipment based on a repair survey performed at the depot 
when the equipment comes off lease  estimates of the cost to repair the equipment are prepared 
we bill the lessee based on this estimate and record maintenance and repair revenue at that time 
in accordance with revenue revenue recognition principal agent considerations topic  we recognize billings to customers for damages incurred and certain other pass through costs as revenue 
we recognize gross revenues from these pass through costs as we are the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third parties  we generally have the discretion in selection of the repair service provider  and we generally have the credit risk because the services are purchased prior to reimbursement being received 
other revenue includes fees earned on the management of container equipment for third party owners 
leasing equipment leasing equipment includes refrigerated and dry containers and gensets  which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
residual values are evaluated annually or sooner if market conditions cause our estimates to change significantly 
we estimate residual values based on fair market values and prior history 
we account for initial direct costs in the acquisition of leases in accordance with the leases fasb topic in certain circumstances  we will prepay commissions to sales agents when they have closed equipment lease transactions 
for both operating and direct finance leases  we capitalize those commission payments and amortize them over the initial lease term or the earliest date that the lease may be terminated 
containers containers are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
the estimated useful life for our reefers is years from the date of service and years for dry containers 
residual values for reefers are estimated to be of their original cost and dry containers residual values are estimated to be of their original cost 
cost incurred to place the new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we recognize repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of our assets as incurred and include them in direct operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
gensets gensets are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
gensets are depreciated over a year life from the date of service 
residual values for gensets are estimated to be of their original cost 
direct finance leases direct finance leases are recorded at the aggregated future minimum lease payments  including any bargain or economically compelled purchase options granted to the customer  less unearned income 
management performs annual reviews of the estimated residual values 
accounting for customer defaults we have sought to reduce credit risk by maintaining insurance against loss of equipment and to a limited extent  loss of lease revenue due to customer insolvency 
we cease the recognition of lease revenues for amounts billable to the lessee after the lease default date at the time we determine that such amounts are not probable of collection from the lessee 
in connection with the accounting for the insurance policy  we record a reduction to our expenses in the period when the insurance proceeds are received 
leasing equipment held for sale in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic  leasing equipment held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
leasing assets held for sale are not depreciated and related deferred costs are not amortized 
leasing assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value 
the majority of our impairments occur at the conclusion of an operating lease whereby our equipment is of an advanced age with a certain amount of damage that the lessee is responsible for 
the decision to categorize the equipment as held for sale is based upon a discounted cash flow model which includes costs rebillable to the lessee 
these costs are recorded as other revenues and are not recorded as a reduction of the impairment on leasing assets 
sales of leasing equipment we record the gains and losses from the sales of leasing equipment as part of other expense  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
gains and losses are recognized upon completion of the sale based upon the sales price and the book value of the equipment 
impairment of leasing equipment in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our leasing equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group as a whole may not be recoverable 
impairment exists when the carrying value of leasing assets taken as a whole exceeds the sum of the related undiscounted cash flows 
our review for impairment includes considering the existence of impairment indicators including third party appraisals of our equipment  adverse changes in market conditions for specific long lived assets and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of our equipment 
when indicators of impairment suggest that the carrying value of our leasing assets may not be recoverable  we determine whether the impairment recognition criteria have been met by evaluating whether the carrying value of the leasing assets taken as a whole exceeds the related undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
the preparation of the related undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates  including the level of future rents  the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the assets estimated downtime between re leasing events and the amount of re leasing costs 
additionally  we test our equipment for impairment when equipment comes off lease and a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of the equipment exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable  we will assess the fair values of the assets 
in determining the fair value of the assets  we consider market trends  published values for similar assets  recent transactions of similar assets and quotes from third party appraisers 
if the carrying amount of the equipment coming off lease exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
provision for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a periodic review of the collectability of our receivables on a customer by customer basis for those accounts which we believe may be experiencing difficulties in meeting their payment terms or have had such difficulties in the past 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for the doubtful account for each of these customers is based upon several factors including their credit rating  their prior payment history  discussions with the customers management  and current events we are involved in that could have financial implications 
for all remaining accounts  we apply a delinquency factor based upon prior history to the total amount due in order to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the delinquency factor represents the best estimate of those accounts that will become uncollectible 
changes in economic conditions may require a reassessment of the risk and could result in additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluates a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated statement of operations and the appropriate reserve to establish  if any 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized 
potential interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
business combinations a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
in accordance with the business combinations topic  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of acquired businesses is determined based on valuations performed by independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  if necessary 
we believe the estimated fair values determined for our acquisitions and allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
such assumptions are not certain and may not be indicative of actual performance 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other topic  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach 
management has determined that we have one reporting unit 
in the first step  the fair value is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
estimates of fair value are based on a number of factors  including quoted market prices and discounted cash flow analysis based on current operating forecasts and long range projections 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill using consistent methodologies and concluded that fair value substantially exceeded carrying value and no impairment existed for the years ended december   and derivatives instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic  which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and establishes criteria for both the designation and effectiveness of hedging activities 
in order to reduce interest rate risk  we have and may enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time where we would receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting a floating rate borrowing to fixed rate 
we intend to hedge only the risk related to changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
we do not enter into other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations 
however  we seek to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
new accounting pronouncements adopted in in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  which amends asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to require the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
additionally  it eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition in accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements and significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the revised guidance provides entities with the option of adopting the revisions retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption 
the company has applied asu prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in beginning on or after january  the adoption of asu had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
pending adoption in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu  which eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
the company may either present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the company will present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements beginning january  off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk while our leasing per diems are billed and paid to us in us dollars  we are subject to exchange gains and losses for local currency expenditures 
we record the effect of non us dollar currency transactions when we translate the non us subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars using exchange rates as they exist at the end of each month 
we have a division located in denmark  with the functional currency of the danish krone 
the effect of fluctuations in danish krone was not material in any period presented 
interest rate risk we have long term debt obligations that accrue interest at variable rates 
interest rate changes may therefore impact the amount of interest payments  future earnings and cash flows 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates that may result from fluctuations in the variable rates of interest accrued by our long term debt obligations 
based on the debt obligation payable as of december   we estimate that cash flows from interest expense relating to variable rate debt and the relevant interest rate swap agreement would increase decrease by approximately million on an annual basis in the event interest rates were to increase decrease by 
credit risk we are subject to concentrations of credit risk with respect to amounts due from customers 
we seek to limit our credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and  when deemed necessary  require letters of credit  guarantees or collateral 
our credit policy sets different maximum exposure guidelines for each customer 
credit criteria may include  but are not limited to  customer trade route  country  social and political climate  assessments of net worth  asset ownership  bank and trade credit references  credit bureau reports  operational history and financial strength 
we seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining insurance coverage against customer insolvency and related equipment losses 
we maintain contingent physical damage  recovery and loss of revenue insurance  which provides coverage in the event of a customer s insolvency  bankruptcy or default giving rise to our demand for return of all of our equipment 
subject to the policy s deductible and other terms and conditions  it covers the cost of recovering our equipment  damage to the equipment  loss of equipment and  to a limited extent  lost revenues 
this coverage automatically renews for one additional one year term on the anniversary of the commencement date subject to maintaining a certain claim experience rate 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments have counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements and repurchase agreements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against this risk and will ultimately realize an economic benefit from our hedging strategies or recover the full value of the securities underlying our repurchase agreements in the event of a default by a counterparty 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts includes our estimate of allowances necessary for receivables on both operating and direct financing lease receivables 
the provision for doubtful accounts is developed based on two key components specific reserves for receivables which are impaired for which management believes full collection is doubtful and reserves for estimated losses inherent in the receivables based upon historical trends 
we believe our provision for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
in addition  changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the provision for doubtful accounts 
direct financing leases are evaluated on a case by case basis 
when evaluating our operating and direct financing lease receivables for impairment  we consider  among other things  the level of past due amounts of the respective receivable  the borrower s financial condition  credit quality indicators of the borrower  the value of underlying collateral and third party credit enhancements such as guarantees and insurance policies 
once a direct financing lease is determined to be non performing  our procedures provide for the following events to take place in order to evaluate collectability the past due amounts are reclassified to accounts receivable  the equipment value supporting such direct financing lease is reclassified to leasing equipment  and collectability is evaluated  taking into consideration equipment book value and the total outstanding receivable  as well as the likelihood of collection through the recovery of equipment 
the adequacy of our provision for doubtful accounts is provided based upon a monthly review of the collectability of our receivables 
this review is based on the risk profile of the receivables  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions  as well as the value of underlying collateral in the case of direct financing lease receivables
