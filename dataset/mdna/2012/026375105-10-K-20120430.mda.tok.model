item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 
there are factors outside of our control that may decrease the demand for our products and services  which may adversely affect our performance 
our success depends on the sustained demand for our products 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending on our products  including  among other things  general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  weather  fuel prices and consumer confidence in future economic conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
during periods of economic decline  when discretionary income is lower  consumers or potential consumers could delay  reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services  which reduces our sales 
in addition  during such periods  advertising revenue in our ag interactive businesses decline  as advertisers reduce their advertising budgets 
a prolonged economic downturn or slow economic recovery may also lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

table of contents providing new and compelling products is critical to our future profitability and cash flow 
one of our key business strategies has been to gain profitable market share through product leadership  providing relevant  compelling and superior product offerings 
as a result  the need to continuously update and refresh our product offerings is an ongoing  evolving process requiring expenditures and investments that will continue to impact net sales  earnings and cash flows over future periods 
at times  the amount and timing of such expenditures and investments depends on the success of a product offering as well as the schedules of our retail partners 
we cannot assure you that this strategy will increase either our revenue or profitability 
for example  we may not be able to anticipate or respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards or shifts in consumer shopping behavior 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly sell or overstock unpopular products and be forced to grant significant credits  accept significant returns or write off a significant amount of inventory  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
conversely  shortages of popular items could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience volatility in our earnings as a result of expenses and investments we may make over the next several years 
we have and expect to continue to focus our resources on our core greeting card business  developing new  and growing existing business  including by expanding internet and other channels of electronic distribution to make american greetings the natural and preferred social expressions solution  as well as by capturing any shifts in consumer demand 
for example  during fiscal  we spent approximately million on incremental marketing expenses in support of our product leadership strategy  primarily related to promotional efforts around our recently developed site cardstore 
com  which allows consumers to purchase paper greeting cards on the internet and then have the physical cards delivered directly to the recipient 
in fiscal  we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses and make additional investments to help us extend our leadership position and better position us for future growth  including incurring additional expenses to support our efforts in digital channels of distribution 
the timing and the amount of this spending are difficult to estimate  but amounts may be material 
in addition  to the extent we are successful in expanding distribution and revenue in connection with expanding our market leadership  additional capital may be deployed as we may incur incremental costs associated with this expanded distribution  including upfront costs prior to any incremental revenue being generated 
if incurred  these costs may be material 
we also expect to begin investing in the development of a new world headquarters 
although we are currently in the early stages of the project  based on preliminary estimates  it is estimated that the gross costs associated with a new world headquarters building will be between approximately million and million over the next two to three years 
over roughly the next five or six years  we also expect to allocate resources  including capital  to refresh our information technology systems by modernizing our systems  redesigning and deploying new processes  and evolving new organization structures all intended to drive efficiencies within the business and add new capabilities 
amounts that we spend could be material in any given fiscal year 
in addition  over the life of the project of roughly the next five or six years  we currently expect to spend at least an aggregate of million to refresh our information technology systems  the majority of which we expect will be capital expenditures 
we believe these investments are important to our business  helping us drive further efficiencies and add new capabilities  however  there can be no assurance that we will not spend more or less than million over the life of the project  or that we will achieve the associated efficiencies or any cost savings 
consumers shifting to value shopping may negatively impact our profitability 
over the past several years  consumer shopping patterns have continued to evolve and that shift is impacting us 
as consumers have been gradually shifting to value shopping  this shift is resulting in a change in our product mix to a higher proportion of value line cards that lowers the average price sold of our greeting cards and has an unfavorable impact on our gross margin percentage 
we expect this trend to continue  which will put continued downward pressure on our historical gross margin percentage 
although we believe that we can mitigate some of the impact this trend may have on our operating margin percentage by continuing to focus on efficiency and cost reduction within all areas of the corporation  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our gross margin percentage will not decrease further 

table of contents we rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a few of our customers are material to our business and operations 
net sales to our five largest customers  which include mass merchandisers as well as card and gift shops  accounted for approximately of total revenue for and and of total revenue for approximately  and of the north american social expression products segment s revenue in  and  respectively  was attributable to its top five customers  and approximately  and of the international social expression products segment s revenue in  and  respectively  was attributable to its top three customers 
net sales to wal mart stores  inc and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively  and net sales to target corporation accounted for approximately of total revenue in and and of total revenue in there can be no assurance that our large customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past 
the loss of sales to one of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
difficulties in integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business and we may not achieve the cost savings and increased revenues anticipated as a result of these acquisitions 
we continue to regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and strengthen our business 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates  acquire candidates on acceptable terms or integrate acquired businesses successfully 
future acquisitions could cause us to take on additional compliance obligations as well as experience dilution and incur debt  contingent liabilities  increased interest expense  restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
integrating future businesses that we may acquire involves significant challenges 
in particular  the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration of these acquired businesses has and will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from our day to day operations 
the process of integrating operations may also cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel 
employee uncertainty and distraction during the integration process may also disrupt our business 
our strategy is  in part  predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services 
achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  we may not be able to realize the benefits of anticipated integration of sales forces  asset rationalization  systems integration  and more comprehensive product and service offerings 
if schurman fine papers is unable to operate its retail stores successfully  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
on april   we sold our retail operations segment  including all of our card and gift retail store assets  to schurman fine papers schurman  which now operates stores under a number of brands  including the american greetings  carlton cards and papyrus brands 
although we do not control schurman  because schurman is licensing the papyrus  american greetings and carlton cards names from us for its retail stores  actions taken by schurman may be seen by the public as actions taken by us  which  in turn  could adversely affect our reputation or brands 
in addition  the failure of schurman to operate its retail stores profitably could have a material adverse effect on us  our reputation and our brands  and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  because  under the terms of the transaction we remain subject to certain of the retail operations store leases on a contingent basis through our subleasing of stores to schurman as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report  as of february   schurman s aggregate commitments to us under these subleases was approximately million  
table of contents we are the predominant supplier of greeting cards and other social expression products to the retail stores operated by schurman  and we have provided credit support to schurman  including a guaranty of up to million in favor of the lenders under schurman s senior revolving credit facility  and up to million of subordinated financing under a loan agreement with schurman  each as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
as a result  if schurman is unable to operate its retail stores profitably  we may incur significant costs if schurman is unable to pay for product that it has purchased from us  schurman is unable to pay rent and other amounts due with respect to the retail store leases that we have subleased to it  we become obligated under our guaranty of its indebtedness  or schurman is unable to repay amounts that it may borrow from us from time to time under our loan agreement with schurman 
accordingly  we may decide in the future to provide schurman with additional financial or operational support to assist schurman in successfully operating its stores 
providing such support  however  could result in it being determined that we have a controlling financial interest in schurman under the financial accounting standards board s standards pertaining to the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
for information regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
if it is determined that we have a controlling financial interest in schurman  we will be required to consolidate schurman s operations into our results  which could materially affect our reported results of operations and financial position as we would be required to include a portion of schurman s income or losses and assets and liabilities into our financial statements 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by retail consolidations 
with continued retail trade consolidations  we are increasingly dependent upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to display space  scan based trading and other conditions 
increased consolidations in the retail industry could result in other changes that could damage our business  such as a loss of customers  decreases in volume  less favorable contractual terms and the growth of discount chains 
in addition  as the bargaining strength of our retail customers grows  we may be required to grant greater credits  discounts  allowances and other incentive considerations to these customers 
we may not be able to recover the costs of these incentives if the customer does not purchase a sufficient amount of products during the term of its agreement with us  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
bankruptcy of key customers could give rise to an inability to pay us and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts 
many of our largest customers are mass merchandiser retailers 
the mass merchandiser retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years 
in addition  the worldwide downturn in the economy and decreasing consumer demand over the past several years has put pressure on the retail industry in general  as well as specialty retailers specifically  including certain of the card and gift shops that we supply 
as a result  retailers have experienced liquidity problems and some have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
there is a risk that certain of our key customers will not pay us  will seek additional credit from us  or that payment may be delayed because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond our control  which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and may require us to write off deferred cost assets 
additionally  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if certain of our larger retail customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy  or significantly reduce the number of stores they operate 
we rely on foreign sources of production and face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets 
we rely on foreign manufacturers and suppliers for various products we distribute to customers 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
we generally do not 
table of contents have long term supply contracts and some of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas 
in addition  a portion of our current operations are conducted and located abroad 
the success of our sales to  and operations in  foreign markets depends on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we sell our products 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political instability  civil unrest and labor shortages  imposition of new legislation and customs regulations relating to imports that may limit the quantity and or increase the cost of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a particular region  lack of effective product quality control procedures by foreign manufacturers and suppliers  currency and foreign exchange risks  and potential delays or disruptions in transportation as well as potential border delays or disruptions 
also  new regulatory initiatives may be implemented that have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include antidumping and countervailing duties or other trade related sanctions  which could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries 
additionally  as a large  multinational corporation  we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world  including antitrust and tax requirements  anti boycott regulations  import export customs regulations and other international trade regulations  the uk bribery act  the usa patriot act and the foreign corrupt practices act 
failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to criminal or monetary liabilities and other sanctions  which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating income and conversely  the weakening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact 
for the year ended february   foreign currency translation favorably affected revenues by million and favorably affected income from continuing operations before income taxes by million compared to the year ended february  certain transactions  particularly in foreign locations  are denominated in other than that location s local currency 
changes in the exchange rates between the two currencies from the original transaction date to the settlement date will result in a currency transaction gain or loss that directly impacts our reported earnings 
for the year ended february   the impact of currency movements on these transactions unfavorably affected operating income by million 
the volatility of currency exchange rates may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the greeting card and gift packaging industries are extremely competitive  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
there are an estimated  greeting card publishers in the united states ranging from small  family run organizations to major corporations 
with the expansion of the internet as a distribution channel for greeting cards  together with the growing use of technology by consumers to create personalized greeting cards with digital photographs and other personalized content  we are also seeing increased competition from greeting card publishers as well as a wide range of personal publishing  mobile and electronic media businesses distributing greeting cards and other social expression products directly to the individual consumer through the internet 
in general  however  the greeting card business is extremely concentrated 
we believe that we are one of only two main suppliers offering a full line of social expression products 
our main competitor  hallmark cards  inc  as well as other companies with which we may compete  may have 
table of contents substantially greater financial  technical or marketing resources  a greater customer base  stronger name recognition and a lower cost of funds than we do 
certain of these competitors may also have longstanding relationships with certain large customers to which they may offer products that we do not provide  putting us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  including sales directly to consumers through the internet  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we are unable to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to our customers and ultimate consumers  or if we are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products to achieve widespread market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively  our sales may be adversely affected  we may be required to take certain financial charges  including goodwill impairments  and our results of operations and financial condition could otherwise be adversely affected 
we are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our borrowing arrangements  which could affect our flexibility to fund ongoing operations  uses of capital and strategic initiatives  and  if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants  it could lead to significant challenges in meeting our liquidity requirements 
the terms of our borrowing arrangements contain a number of restrictive covenants  including customary operating restrictions that limit our ability to engage in such activities as borrowing and making investments  capital expenditures and distributions on our capital stock  and engaging in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
we are also subject to customary financial covenants  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
these covenants restrict the amount of our borrowings  reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives 
these borrowing arrangements are described in more detail in liquidity and capital resources under item and in note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
compliance with some of these covenants is based on financial measures derived from our operating results 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results  such as through reduced customer demand and inflation 
a decline in our business could make us unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  in which case we may be restricted in how we manage our business and deploy capital  including by limiting our ability to make acquisitions and dispositions  pay dividends and repurchase our stock 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain compliance with our financial covenants or otherwise breach the covenants that we are subject to under our borrowing arrangements  our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations 
such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  our credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets  including the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
if we cannot repay all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit agreement  our lenders could proceed against our assets 
pending litigation could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations and cash flows 
as described in item legal proceedings of this annual report  from time to time we are engaged in lawsuits which may require significant management time and attention and legal expense  and may result in an unfavorable outcome  which could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations and cash flows 
current estimates of loss regarding pending litigation are based on information that is then available to us and may not reflect any particular final outcome 
the results of rulings  judgments or settlements of pending litigation may result in financial liability that is materially higher than what management has estimated at this time 
we make no assurances that we will not be subject to liability with 
table of contents respect to current or future litigation 
we maintain various forms of insurance coverage 
however  substantial rulings  judgments or settlements could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy 
the amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks  facts and circumstances existing at the time 
we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax related accounts 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  which may impact our effective tax rate and or our financial results 
we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
in addition  changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances  with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 
our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain advantageous content licenses from third parties to produce products 
to provide an assortment of relevant  compelling and superior product offerings  an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various popular brands  celebrities  character properties  designs  content and other material owned by third parties 
in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses  we may not be able to meet changing customer demands and preferences for greeting cards and our other products  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not realize the full benefit of the material we license from third parties if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 
the agreements under which we license popular brands  celebrities  character properties  design  content and other material owned by third parties usually require that we pay an advance and or provide a minimum royalty guarantee that may be substantial 
in some cases  these advances or minimums may be greater than what we will be able to recoup in profits from actual sales  which could result in write offs of such amounts that would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  we may acquire or renew licenses requiring minimum guarantee payments that may result in us paying higher effective royalties  if the overall benefit of obtaining the license outweighs the risk of potentially losing  not renewing or otherwise not obtaining a valuable license 
when obtaining a license  we realize there is no guarantee that a particular licensed property will make a successful greeting card or other product in the eye of the ultimate consumer 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a successful licensed property will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future 
our inability to protect or defend our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands 
we believe that our trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brands  success and competitive position 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secrets and patent laws in the united states and similar laws in other jurisdictions and on confidentiality and other types of agreements with some employees  vendors  consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these measures  if we are unable to successfully file for  register or otherwise enforce our rights or if 
table of contents these rights are infringed  invalidated  challenged  circumvented or misappropriated  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
also  we are  and may in the future be  subject to intellectual property rights claims in the united states or foreign countries  which could limit our ability to use certain intellectual property  products or brands in the future 
defending any such claims  even claims without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly settlements  litigation or restrictions on our business and could damage our reputation 
rapidly changing trends in the children s entertainment market could adversely affect our business 
a portion of our business and results of operations depends upon the appeal of our licensed character properties  which are used to create various toy and entertainment items for children 
consumer preferences  particularly among children  are continuously changing 
the children s entertainment industry experiences significant  sudden and often unpredictable shifts in demand caused by changes in the preferences of children to more on trend entertainment properties 
moreover  the life cycle for individual youth entertainment products tends to be short 
therefore  our ability to maintain our current market share and increase our market share in the future depends on our ability to satisfy consumer preferences by enhancing existing entertainment properties and developing new entertainment properties 
if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges in a timely and cost effective manner  demand for our collection of entertainment properties could decrease and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we may incur significant costs developing entertainment properties that may not generate future revenues at the levels that we anticipated  which could in turn create fluctuations in our reported results based on when those costs are expensed and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
the social expression industry is a seasonal business  with sales generally being higher in the second half of our fiscal year due to the concentration of major holidays during that period 
consequently  our overall results of operations in the future may fluctuate substantially based on seasonal demand for our products 
such variations in demand could have a material adverse effect on the timing of cash flow and therefore our ability to meet our obligations with respect to our debt and other financial commitments 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  since we usually order and manufacture merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new trends are confirmed by customer orders or consumer purchases 
we must carry significant amounts of inventory  especially before the holiday season selling period 
if we are not successful in selling the inventory during the holiday period  we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices  or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all 
increases in raw material and energy costs may materially raise our costs and materially impact our profitability 
paper is a significant expense in the production of our greeting cards 
significant increases in paper prices  which have been volatile in past years  or increased costs of other raw materials or energy  such as fuel  may result in declining margins and operating results if market conditions prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases on our greeting cards and other social expression products 
the loss of key members of our senior management and creative teams could adversely affect our business 
our success and continued growth depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our current senior management team as well as upon a number of key members of our creative staff  who have been instrumental in our success thus far  and upon our ability to attract and retain other highly capable and creative individuals 
the loss of some of our senior executives or key members of our creative staff  or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals  could materially and adversely affect us 
we seek to compensate our key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership  bonus plans or other incentives  but we can make no assurance that these programs will enable us to retain key employees or hire new employees 

table of contents if we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike  or other work stoppage  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
in particular  approximately  of our employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work related stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
employee benefit costs constitute a significant element of our annual expenses and funding these costs could adversely affect our financial condition 
employee benefit costs are a significant element of our cost structure 
certain expenses  particularly postretirement costs under defined benefit pension plans and healthcare costs for employees and retirees  may increase significantly at a rate that is difficult to forecast and may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in addition  the newly enacted federal healthcare legislation is expected to increase our employer sponsored medical plan costs  some of which increases could be significant 
declines in global capital markets may cause reductions in the value of our pension plan assets 
such circumstances could have an adverse effect on future pension expense and funding requirements 
further information regarding our retirement benefits is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this annual report 
various environmental regulations and risks applicable to a manufacturer and or distributor of consumer products may require us to take actions  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state  provincial  local and foreign laws and regulations  including regulations with respect to chemical usage  air emissions  wastewater and storm water discharges and other releases into the environment as well as the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  including hazardous materials 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  because legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements  which may be significant  or the effect on our operations as these laws and regulations may give rise to claims  uncertainties or possible loss contingencies for future environmental remediation liabilities and costs 
we cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations  will not have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the impact of environmental laws and regulations  regulatory enforcement activities  the discovery of unknown conditions  and third party claims for damages to the environment  real property or persons could result in additional liabilities and costs in the future 
we may be subject to product liability claims and our products could be subject to voluntary or involuntary recalls and other actions 
we are subject to numerous federal  state  provincial and foreign laws and regulations governing product safety including  but not limited to  those regulations enforced by the consumer product safety commission 
a failure to comply with such laws and regulations  or concerns about product safety may lead to a recall of selected products 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  recalls and defects or errors in products after their production and sale to customers 
such recalls and defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by our retail customers and consumers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs  any of which could harm our business 
individuals could sustain injuries from our products and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
governmental agencies could pursue us and issue civil fines and or criminal penalties for a failure to comply 
table of contents with product safety regulations 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
additionally  we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future 
recalls  post manufacture repairs of our products  product liability claims  absence or cost of insurance and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm our reputation  increase costs or reduce sales 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving  and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could harm our business and results of operations 
we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  restrictions on imports and exports  customs  tariffs  user privacy  data protection  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  electronic contracts and other communications  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services  broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property use and ownership  sales and other taxes  fraud  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e commerce 
those laws that do reference the internet are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain 
for example  the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  is intended  in part  to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for including or for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others 
portions of the communications decency act  or cda  are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content 
we rely on the protections provided by both the dmca and cda in conducting our online business 
any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business 
the children s online privacy protection act is intended to impose additional restrictions on the ability of online service providers to collect user information from minors 
in addition  the protection of children from sexual predators act of requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
the costs of compliance with these regulations may increase in the future as a result of changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them 
further  any failures on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities 
those current and future laws and regulations or unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations 
information technology infrastructure failures could significantly affect our business 
we depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives 
portions of our information technology infrastructure are old and difficult to maintain 
we could experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure  such as a computer virus  a problem with the functioning of an important information technology application  or an intentional disruption of our information technology systems 
in addition  our information technology systems could suffer damage or interruption from human error  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  terrorist attacks  acts of war and similar events 
the disruptions caused by any such events could impede our ability to record or process orders  manufacture and ship in a timely manner  properly store consumer images  or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course 
any such event could cause us to lose customers or revenue  damage our reputation  and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns 
over roughly the next five or six years  we expect to allocate resources  including capital  to refresh our information technology systems by modernizing our systems  redesigning and deploying new processes  and evolving new organization structures all intended to drive efficiencies within the business and add new capabilities 
such an implementation is expensive and carries substantial operational risk  including loss of data or information  unanticipated increases in costs  disruption of operations or business interruption 
further  we may not be successful implementing new systems or any new system may not perform as expected 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we could experience cost over runs and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction and relocation to a new world headquarters 
we anticipate investing in the development of a new world headquarters in northeastern ohio over the next two to three years 
based on preliminary estimates  we anticipate that the gross costs associated with the new world headquarters building  before any tax credits  loans or other incentives that we may receive  will be between approximately million and million 
due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature  together with the fact that we are in the preliminary stages of the project  the costs associated with this project may be higher than million and it may take us longer than expected to complete the project

in addition  while shareholders have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors  class b common shares have ten votes per share which limits the ability of holders of class a common shares to elect a director by exercising cumulative voting rights

our international operations include wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom uk  canada  australia and new zealand as well as licensees in approximately other countries 
during  our total revenue  operating results and cash flows were impacted by the multiple strategic actions we executed during the year to support both our short term and long term business goals  including continuing to drive product leadership initiatives  driving growth in our product leadership  primarily our new web site  cardstore 
com  through increased marketing spending  deploying additional capital to fund our multi year systems refresh project intended to drive efficiencies in our business and add new capabilities  expanding our international footprint through the acquisition of watermark publishing limited watermark in the uk  supporting the expanded relationships and distribution with our retail partners through additional investment and rollout activities  and strengthening our balance sheet by refinancing our debt 
although these strategic actions  along with the continued instability in the global economy  have brought volatility to our earnings and make it more difficult to predict future earnings levels and patterns  we believe that these actions will help us grow our business over the long term 
moreover  to mitigate the impact that some of these activities may have on our earnings  we will seek to continue to improve efficiencies and streamline our back office processes in order to reduce our general and administrative expenses 
total revenue for was billion  up million from the prior year 
our higher revenues were driven by increased net sales of greeting cards and seasonal gift packaging products  as well as the impact of foreign currency translation 
the increase in our greeting card net sales was driven by additional distribution with existing customers in both our international social expression products and our north american social expression products segments  as well as the acquisition of watermark 
the watermark acquisition in the first quarter of the current fiscal year added approximately million of revenue and another unique product brand to our strong portfolio of greeting cards 
we believe that the additional distribution with existing customers was achieved as a result of our product leadership efforts  which have focused on providing fresh and relevant 
table of contents products  along with strong in store execution 
we expect to continue to allocate resources to these efforts with the goal of continued revenue and earnings growth 
operating income for was million  down million from the prior year 
the primary driver of the decline in operating income was an impairment of goodwill 
in connection with the preparation of the fiscal financial statements  we determined that the decrease in our market capitalization  which was driven by a decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter  was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment  requiring us to complete an impairment test 
as a result of the testing  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment of million during the fourth quarter 
beyond the impact of the goodwill impairment  the current year operating income performance was impacted by a change in product mix  higher supply chain costs and increased marketing expenses 
our revenue growth in the year added about million of gross margin 
although this equates to a gross margin percentage decline of approximately basis points over the prior year period  it represents a significant improvement from the quarter over quarter basis point gross margin percentage decline that we reported for our third quarter ended november  our gross margin percentage slipped only basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period 
our declining gross margin percentage was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of lower margin value cards and seasonal gift packaging products 
as we have stated  over the past several years  consumer shopping patterns have continued to evolve and these changing patterns are impacting our business 
as consumers have been gradually shifting to value shopping  this shift is resulting in a change in our product mix to a higher proportion of value cards which in turn lowers the average price sold of our greeting cards and has an unfavorable impact on our gross margin percentage 
while we expect this trend to continue  the mix change in the current year compared to the prior year was accelerated as a result of our expanded distribution in the value channel  which has now been substantially implemented 
while we expect the value card trend to put continued downward pressure on our historical gross margin percentage  we are unable to accurately predict our future gross margin percentage due to continuing changes in the general business  influences from the broader macroeconomic environment and ongoing changes with customers that occur in the ordinary course of business which could either improve or further erode our gross margins 
current year operating income also declined compared to the prior year due to higher supply chain costs of approximately million  including merchandiser  freight and other distribution costs that were the result of higher unit sales volume 
approximately million of the higher supply chain costs were related to the rollout costs associated with expanded distribution in the value channel 
during  total incremental rollout costs associated with the expanded distribution in the value channel was approximately million  including the million of supply chain costs and approximately million related to sbt implementations 
the prior year included approximately million of combined supply chain and sbt implementation costs associated with the roll out of the expanded distribution in the value channel 
operating income in was also adversely impacted by approximately million of incremental marketing expenses that we incurred in the year in support of our product leadership strategy  primarily related to promotional efforts around our recently developed web site cardstore 
com  which allows consumers to purchase paper greeting cards on the internet and then have the physical cards delivered directly to the recipient 
as we seek to develop this and other digital channels of distribution  during the first half of we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses and make additional investments to support these efforts in amounts and at a pace that is similar to our spending on these efforts during the second half of we will likely continue this spending during the second half of  however  the timing and amount will depend on consumer response 
also in  we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses and make additional investments to help us extend our leadership position and better position us for future growth 
the timing and amount of expenses associated with these efforts in any given period will also depend on the response from consumers to each program 
some of the investments  business activities and trends discussed above are putting downward pressure on our operating income 
as such  we will continue to focus on supply chain efficiencies to improve the way we manufacture  distribute and service our products 
we also intend to focus resources on streamlining our back office processes in order to reduce our general and administrative expenses 
however  over the next few years  
table of contents we will need to balance these efforts with the efforts necessary to maintain our leadership position in the greeting card market 
by continuing to focus on efficiency and cost reduction within all areas of the company  our goal is to maintain annual operating margins around 
however  our operating margin in any given period may vary depending on the near term impacts of future investments we may make  such as  expenses associated with our world headquarters project  information systems refresh effort and cardstore 
com distribution model 
with respect to our statement of financial position in  inventory increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by the additional distribution with existing customers along with our acquisition of watermark described above 
if we are successful in continuing to drive sales growth  we expect our working capital needs  particularly accounts receivable and inventory  to also grow 
capital expenditures during the year increased approximately million from the prior period 
this increase was primarily related to our information systems refresh  machinery and equipment purchased for our card producing facilities  and assets acquired in connection with our world headquarters project 
we expect that capital expenditures will remain higher than our historical trend as we execute our multi year information systems refresh and world headquarters projects 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we used the net proceeds from the offering along with cash on hand to retire our existing million aggregate principal amount of long term debt due the net result of these transactions was to reduce the principal amount of our long term debt by approximately million  improve the overall terms and conditions of our borrowings and extend the maturity of the notes by an additional five years at the same interest rate 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million  including the write off of the remaining original issue discount and deferred issuance costs of approximately million and approximately million we paid in tender fees  call premiums and other transaction costs  all associated with the retired debt 
also during the fourth quarter  we amended our credit facility to extend the expiration date from june  to january  and increase the maximum principal amount that can be borrowed  on a revolving basis  from million to million  with the ability to further increase such maximum principal amount from million to million  subject to customary conditions

this  or million  improvement was primarily due to an increase in net sales of greeting cards of approximately million driven by the watermark acquisition in our international social expression products segment  as well as additional distribution with existing customers in both our north american social expression products segment and our international social expression products segment 
the current year also included higher gift packaging product sales of approximately million and the impact of approximately million of favorable foreign currency translation 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased sales in our ag interactive segment of approximately million due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of winding down the photoworks website  lower net sales in our fixtures business of approximately million  and decreased sales of other ancillary products such as party goods and ornaments of approximately million 
the contribution of each major product category as a percentage of net sales for the past two fiscal years was as follows everyday greeting cards seasonal greeting cards gift packaging all other products the all other products classification includes  among other things  giftware  party goods  ornaments  calendars  custom display fixtures  stickers  online greeting cards and other digital products

both of our greeting card segments contributed to the unit volume increases during the current year as a result of additional distribution with existing customers 
the unit volume improvements within our international social expression products segment were also driven by the watermark acquisition

the improvement in unit volume was driven by both our greeting card segments across nearly all seasonal programs as a result of additional distribution with existing customers

com  which allows consumers to purchase paper greeting cards on the internet and then have the physical cards delivered directly to the recipient 
as we seek to develop this and other digital channels of distribution  during the first half of fiscal we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses and make additional investments to support these efforts in amounts and at a pace that is similar to our spending on these efforts during the second half of we will likely continue this spending during the second half of  however  the timing and amount will depend on consumer response 
in addition  to the extent we are successful in expanding distribution and revenue in connection with expanding our leadership  additional capital may be deployed as we may incur incremental costs associated with this expanded distribution  including upfront costs prior to any incremental revenue being generated 
if incurred  these costs may be material 
over roughly the next five or six years  we expect to allocate resources  including capital  to refresh our information technology systems by modernizing our systems  redesigning and deploying new processes  and evolving new organization structures all intended to drive efficiencies within the business and add new capabilities 
amounts that we spend could be material in any given fiscal year and over the life of the project 
during  we spent approximately million  including capital of approximately million and expense of approximately million  on these information technology systems 
in addition  over roughly the next five or six years  we currently expect to spend at least an aggregate of million on these information technology systems  the majority of which we expect will be capital expenditures 
we believe these investments are important to our business  help us drive further efficiencies and add new capabilities  however  there can be no assurance that we will not spend more or less than million over the life of the project  or that we will achieve the associated efficiencies or any cost savings 
during march  we also announced that in fiscal we expect that we will begin to invest in the development of a world headquarters in the northeast ohio area 
the state of ohio has committed certain tax credits  loans and other incentives totaling up to million to assist us in the development of a new headquarters in ohio 
we are required to make certain investments and meet other criteria to receive these incentives over time 
we are currently in the early stages of the project and have not yet completed the architectural design for the new building 
however  based on preliminary estimates  it is anticipated that the gross costs associated with a new world headquarters building  before any tax credit  loans or other incentives that we may receive  will be between approximately million and million over the next two to three years 
during  we repurchased million of our class a common shares  representing the remaining amount authorized under the million stock repurchase authorized by our board of directors in january also  during  we repurchased million of our class a common shares under the million stock repurchase program announced on january  under this program  the share repurchases may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant  at prices we deem appropriate  and subject to applicable legal requirements and other factors 
there is no set expiration date for this program 
our future operating cash flow and borrowing availability under our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility are expected to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
the seasonal nature of our business results in peak working capital requirements that may be financed through short term borrowings when cash on hand is insufficient 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of february  payment due by period as of february  dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases commitments under customer agreements commitments under royalty agreements interest payments severance commitments under purchase agreements approximately million of the operating lease commitments in the table above relate to retail stores acquired by schurman that are being subleased to schurman 
the failure of schurman to operate the retail stores successfully could have a material adverse effect on us because if schurman is not able to comply with its obligations under the subleases  we remain contractually obligated  as primary lessee  under those leases 
the interest payments in the above table are determined assuming the same level of debt outstanding in the future years as was outstanding at february  under our credit agreement and accounts receivable facility at the current average interest rates for those facilities 
in addition to the contracts noted in the table  we issue purchase orders for products  materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of business 
these purchase orders typically do not include long term volume commitments  are based on pricing terms previously negotiated with vendors and are generally cancelable with the appropriate notice prior to receipt of the materials or supplies 
accordingly  the foregoing table excludes open purchase orders for such products  materials and supplies as of february  also  we have provided credit support to schurman including a guaranty of up to million in favor of the lenders under schurman s senior revolving credit facility  and up to million of subordinated financing under a loan agreement with schurman  each as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report  which are not included in the table as no amounts have been drawn and therefore we cannot determine the amount of usage in the future 
although we do not anticipate that contributions will be required in to the defined benefit pension plan that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of gibson greetings  inc in  we may make contributions in excess of the legally required minimum contribution level 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
we do anticipate that contributions will be required beginning in fiscal  but those amounts have not been determined as of february  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item of this annual report 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of the critical areas that required a higher degree of judgment or are considered complex 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably expect will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although we consider these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the retail markets in which we operate could have a material effect on the required allowance balances 
sales returns we provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return  primarily seasonal cards and certain other seasonal products  in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical sales returns  the amount of current year sales and other known factors 
estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience 
however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from these estimates if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and or its market 
we regularly monitor our actual performance to estimated rates and the adjustments attributable to any changes have historically not been material 
deferred costs in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with certain customers for the supply of greeting cards and related products 
we view such agreements as advantageous in developing and maintaining business with our retail customers 
the customer may receive a combination of cash payments  credits  discounts  allowances and other incentives to be earned as product is purchased from us over the stated term of the agreement or minimum purchase volume commitment 
these agreements are negotiated individually to meet competitive situations and therefore  while some aspects of the agreements may be similar  important contractual terms may vary 
in addition  the agreements may or may not specify us as the sole supplier of social expression products to the customer 
although risk is inherent in the granting of advances  we subject such customers to our normal credit review 
we maintain an allowance for deferred costs based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative measures incorporating historical write offs 
in instances where we are aware of a particular customer s inability to meet its performance obligation  we record a specific allowance to reduce the deferred cost asset to an estimate of its future value based upon expected recoverability 
losses attributed to these specific events have historically not been material 
the aggregate average remaining life of our contract base is years 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in accordance with asc topic asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized  but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we complete the annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter 
to test for goodwill impairment  we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units 
while we may use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing  our primary methods are discounted cash flows and a market based analysis 
we estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates 
changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we assess whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
the assumptions used in this assessment are consistent with our internal planning 
a valuation allowance is recorded against those deferred tax assets determined to not be realizable based on our assessment 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or decreased in the future if our assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies change

in june  the fasb issued asu no 
asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income

table of contents them in the notes to the financial statements 
the other requirements in asu are not affected by asu asu and asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  but it will affect how we present our other comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
asu gives entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
only if an entity determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying amount  would it be required to then perform the first step of the two step quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  the two step quantitative impairment testing is not required 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no

asu requires an employer who participates in multiemployer pension plans to provide additional disclosures to help financial statement users to better understand the plans in which an employer participates  the level of the employer s participation in those plans and the financial health of those plans 
asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
since asu does not change the existing recognition and measurement guidance for an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan  our adoption of this standard during the fourth quarter of did not impact our financial statements 
factors that may affect future results certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use such words as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available information  but are subject to a variety of uncertainties  unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment  which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements  and that could adversely affect our future financial performance  include  but are not limited to  the following a weak retail environment and general economic conditions  competitive terms of sale offered to customers  including costs and other terms associated with new and expanded customer relationships  the loss of one or more retail customers and or retail consolidations  acquisitions and bankruptcies  including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms  the timing and impact of expenses incurred and investments made to support new retail or product strategies  including increased marketing expenses  as well as new product introductions and achieving the desired benefits from those investments  the timing of investments in  together with the ability to successfully implement or achieve the desired benefits and cost savings associated with  any information systems refresh we may implement  the timing and impact of converting customers to a scan based trading model  the ability to achieve the desired benefits associated with our cost reduction efforts  schurman fine papers ability to successfully operate its retail operations and satisfy its obligations to us  consumer demand for social expression products generally  shifts in consumer shopping behavior  and consumer acceptance of products as priced and marketed  including the success of new and expanded advertising and marketing efforts  such as our on line efforts through cardstore

risks pertaining specifically to ag interactive include the viability of online advertising  subscriptions as revenue generators  and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing social media and the digital photo sharing space 
the risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us 
should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our financial performance related to forward looking statements  refer to the risk factors section included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments we had no derivative financial instruments as of february  interest rate exposure we manage interest rate exposure through a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
currently  the majority of our debt is carried at fixed interest rates 
therefore  our overall interest rate exposure risk is minimal 
based on our interest rate exposure on our non fixed rate debt as of and during the year ended february   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on interest expense 
under the terms of our current credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow significantly more floating rate debt  which  if incurred could have a material impact on interest expense in a fluctuating interest rate environment 
foreign currency exposure our international operations expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of international subsidiaries to us dollars could affect comparability of results between years 
approximately  and of our  and total revenue from continuing operations  respectively  were generated from operations outside the united states 
operations in australia  new zealand  canada  the european union and the uk are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
no assurance can be given that future results will not be affected by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  for the period ended february   a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would not materially affect our income before income tax expense
