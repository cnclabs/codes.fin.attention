the company strives to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
these factors result in a high rate of inventory turns and typically cause company inventory levels to appear relatively low compared to sales volume 
a key element of the company s manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed the company to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
the business is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how the company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions 
for external reporting purposes  the company has identified the following reportable segments north american furniture solutions includes the operations associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for work related settings  including office  education  and healthcare environments  throughout the united states and canada 
the north american furniture solutions reportable segment is the aggregation of two operating segments in accordance with asc through in addition  the company has determined that both operating segments within the north american furniture solutions reportable segment each represent reporting units

interest is payable periodically throughout the period a borrowing is outstanding 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company also completed the repurchase of million of registered debt securities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced a reduction in the cash dividend effective for the first quarter of fiscal payment 
this change reduced the cash dividend to per share annually versus a total quarterly cash dividend of per share that was paid through the third quarter of fiscal as part of our decision to conserve cash we suspended significant share repurchases beginning in fiscal the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal totaled million 
subsequent to the end of fiscal the company announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to per share or per share annually 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal and fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal is a result of the repayment of the remaining million in principal due under the public bond issue 
the payment was made using a combination of existing cash and proceeds from newly issued senior unsecured private placement notes of million maturing in march the only usage against the company s unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of the company s private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require the company to adhere to certain covenants and maintain certain performance ratios 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants and performance ratios during fiscal in fiscal  we received million related to the issuance of shares in connection with stock based compensation plans 
this compares to receiving million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal  the company had cash of million including foreign cash of million 
in addition  the company had foreign marketable securities of million 
the foreign subsidiary holding the company s marketable securities is taxed as a us taxpayer at the company s election  consequently  for tax purposes all u 
s tax impacts for this subsidiary have been recorded 
the company currently plans to repatriate approximately million within fiscal from foreign subsidiaries  for which all u 
s taxes have been recorded 
the company s intent is to permanently reinvest the remainder of the foreign cash amounts outside the us the company s plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these balances to fund us operations 
during fiscal the company repatriated million of undistributed foreign earnings 
during fiscal the company did not repatriate any undistributed foreign earnings 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs  subject to financing availability in the marketplace 
contingencies the company leases a facility in the united kingdom under an agreement that expired in june  and the company is currently leasing the facility on a month to month basis 
under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will be approximately million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of june  based on circumstances existing in fiscal  the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  was million 
the company has a lease obligation in the uk until may for a facility that it has exited 
current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement  as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference if it were subleased 
as of june  and may  the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million and million  respectively 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect the company s operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
basis of presentation the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to may fiscal year ending june  contained weeks of operations 
fiscal years ended may  and may  each included weeks of operations 
this is the basis upon which weekly average data is presented 
contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments 
further information regarding debt obligations can be found in note of the consolidated financial statements 
likewise  further information related to operating leases can be found in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in millions payments due by fiscal year total thereafter long term debt estimated interest on debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations pension plan funding stockholder dividends other total estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of june  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension plan funding commitments are known for a month period for those plans that are funded  unfunded pension and post retirement plan funding amounts are equal to the estimated benefit payments 
as of june   the total projected benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of june  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations primarily represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  and other post employment benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  guarantees as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or through owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation thereof is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include any freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates receivable allowances we base our allowances for receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the current economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at june  and may   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the year over year decrease in the allowance is primarily due to the stabilization of economic conditions and continued financial health of our customers 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of june  and may   were million and million  respectively 
the company is required to perform an annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the asset values are impaired 
the company has early adopted the provisions of asu  which permits the company to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value to assess goodwill for impairment 
the quantitative impairment test  when necessary  is based on the present value of projected cash flows and the resulting residual value and includes a reconciliation to market capitalization 
in completing the test under this approach  the company assumes that one of the drivers of the value of a business today is the cash flows it will generate in the future 
the company also assumes that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect the best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
the company completed the required annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded through a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the goodwill of the reporting units are not impaired and thus the two step quantitative impairment test was unnecessary 
the company employs a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what the company believes is what a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to the company s reporting units 
the company believes the discount rates selected in the qualitative assessment are appropriate in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in discount rates  though the testing performed in fiscal indicates that even a significant increase in the discount rate would not have changed the conclusion 
the company employs the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets which is a both a market based approach and an income based approach 
the relief from royalty method focuses on the level of royalty payments that the user of an intangible asset would have to pay a third party for the use of the asset if it were not owned by the user 
this method involves estimating theoretical future after tax royalty payments based on the company s forecasted revenues attributable to the trade names 
these payments are then discounted to present value utilizing a discount rate that considers the after corporate tax required rate of return applicable to the asset 
the projected revenues reflect the best estimate of management for the trade names  however  actual revenues could differ significantly 
the company completed the required annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that two healthcare trade names were impaired during fiscal  resulting in an impairment of million 
the impairment was the result of the company s strategy change during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce its portfolio of healthcare brands and begin marketing the related products under the nemschoff trade name 
the remaining indefinite lived intangible assets tested were not impaired 
the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what the company believes is what a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to the company s reporting units 
the company believes the discount rates selected are appropriate in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in the discount rates and changes in the discount rate may result in future impairment 
long lived assets the company evaluates other long lived assets and acquired business units for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment risk may be present 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million that was related to our convia line of business 
these assets related to products that we determined had no future revenue stream to the company 
the impairment charge was comprised of million of expense related to an intangible asset and million of expense in relation to fixed assets  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million 
this asset impairment relates to the nemschoff plant closure and consolidation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the restructuring action which included this fixed asset impairment 
warranty reserve the company stands behind company products and the promises it makes to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
the company has established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these obligations 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to these reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company establishes reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted in response to changing conditions 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions 
the company has net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
the company also has foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  reserves are established for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
the company also establishes reserves for health  prescription drugs  and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
the company s health benefits retention level does not include an aggregate stop loss policy 
the company s retention levels designated within significant insurance arrangements as of june   are as follows 
retention level general liability and auto liability physical damage million per occurrence workers compensation and property million per occurrence health benefits million per employee pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
the company utilizes the services of an independent actuarial firm to assist in determining the rate 
for the domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
the discount rate is set for the international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations 
interest crediting rate the company uses this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
the company bases this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is still appropriate 
expected long term rate of return the company bases this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
the company considers likely returns and risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents the long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can and do differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of june   and may   the net actuarial loss associated with the employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with lower than expected return on assets for fiscal and fiscal changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the expense and obligations related to our pension plans 
the company cannot accurately predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to the expense or obligation in subsequent years will be significant 
both the june  pension funded status and expense are affected by year end discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions 
any change to these assumptions will be specific to the time periods noted and may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the effect of the indicated increase decrease in discount rates and expected return on assets is shown below in millions assumption percent change expense june  obligation us international us international discount rate expected return on assets for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  the company uses a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  the company recognizes the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of the net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
the company currently estimates this period to be approximately years 
as of june   the deferred net actuarial loss ie the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation the company views stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain employees  non employee directors and officers 
the stock based compensation programs include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options 
the company recognizes expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
the black scholes option pricing model is used in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with compensation programs 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of the common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of the company s common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
the company assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company encounters matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  the company is required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
the company is also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc  takes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
the impact from changes in commodity prices increased the company s costs by approximately million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the net impact of changes in pricing of increased net sales by million  which had the effect of decreasing the company s costs as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal the net impact of changes in pricing in fiscal decreased net sales by million  which had the effect of increasing the company s costs as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal the net impact of changes in pricing in fiscal increased net sales by approximately million  which had the effect of decreasing the company s costs as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal the company believes market prices for commodities in the near term may move higher and acknowledges that over time increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  and chinese renminbi 
as of june   the company had outstanding  ten forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
two forward contracts were placed to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure and two forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset million australian dollar denominated net asset exposure 
five forward contracts were placed to offset a million usdollar denominated net liability exposure 
as of may   the company had outstanding  sixteen forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
two forward contracts were placed to offset a million euro denominated net asset exposure and five forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset million australian dollar denominated net asset exposure 
eight forward contracts were placed to offset a million usdollar denominated net liability exposure 
a net loss of million and million related to remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency was included in net earnings for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal year  a net gain of million impacted net earnings 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million as of the end of fiscal conversely  the effect decreased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million as of the end of fiscal for fiscal the cumulative effect increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total stockholders equity by million 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s interest rate swap agreement expired as planned on march  at the end of fiscal the company held one interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt securities to a variable rate 
the combined fair market value and net asset amount of the effective interest rate swap instruments was million at may  the swap arrangement effectively reduced interest expense by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd 
average interest rate
