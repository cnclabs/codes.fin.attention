beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we redefined our reportable operating segments based on geography as our company is organized and managed along geographic lines  with product offerings and channels based on local custom and regulation

in connection with the new segment structure  we have changed the accountability for  and reporting of  certain items  including administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest and our equity in the net income of unconsolidated affiliates 
when practical  these items are allocated to segments 
interest is also allocated to operating segments when debt is incurred at the local country level and is nonrecourse to ezcorp  inc these items are now included in the segment s measure of profit or loss segment contribution 
expenses that cannot be allocated are included as corporate expenses
