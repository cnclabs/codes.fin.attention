item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
long term business strategy our long term business strategy focuses on several key areas in an effort to foster long term relationships with our customers 
the key areas of our long term strategy follow attract  develop  and empower associates to grow our business  offer outstanding brands in premium facilities and facilitate superior customer service  diversification  
table of contents expand revenues at existing locations and increase higher margin businesses  grow through targeted acquisitions  enhance customer satisfaction  leverage scale and implement best practices  and leverage internet marketing attract  develop  and empower associates to grow our business we view our local dealership general managers and customer facing associates as one of our most important assets 
each dealership or group of dealerships has independent operational and financial management responsible for day to day operations 
we believe experienced local managers are better qualified to make day to day decisions concerning the successful operation of a dealership and can be more responsive to our customers needs 
we seek local dealership management that not only has experience in the automotive industry  but is also familiar with the local dealership s market 
we also have regional management that oversees operations at the individual dealerships and supports the dealerships operationally and administratively 
we invest for future growth and offer outstanding brands and facilities which we believe attracts outstanding talent 
we believe attracting the best talent to our retail dealership operations and allowing our associates to make business decisions at the local level helps to foster long term growth through increased repeat and referral business 
offer outstanding brands in premium facilities and facilitate superior customer service we offer outstanding brands in premium facilities and believe offering our customers a superior customer service experience will generate repeat and referral business and will help to foster a loyal and dedicated customer base 
customer satisfaction is measured at each of our dealerships on a monthly  quarterly  and or yearly basis by the manufacturers we represent  and we compensate our dealership employees  in part  based on their performance in such rankings 
we have the highest percentage of revenues from foreign and luxury brands among the us based publicly traded automotive retailers 
we believe luxury and foreign brands will continue to offer us the opportunity to generate same store growth  including higher margin service and parts sales 
in  our revenue mix consists of related to premium brands  related to volume foreign brands  and relating to brands of us based manufacturers 

table of contents the following chart reflects our percentage of total revenues by brand in logo we sell and service outstanding automotive brands in our premium facilities  in attractive geographic markets 
where advantageous  we attempt to aggregate our dealerships in a campus setting in order to build a destination location for our customers  which we believe helps to drive increased customer traffic to each of the brands at the location 
this strategy also creates an opportunity to reduce personnel expenses  consolidate advertising and administrative expenses and leverage operating expenses over a larger base of dealerships 
our dealerships have generally achieved new unit vehicle sales that are significantly higher than industry averages for the brands we sell 
diversification our business benefits from our diversified revenue mix  including the multiple revenue streams in a traditional automotive dealership new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance  and service and parts operations  and returns relating to our joint venture investments  which we believe helps to mitigate the cyclicality that has historically impacted some elements of the automotive sector 
we are further diversified within our retail automotive operations due to our brand mix and geographical dispersion 
diversification outside the us one of the unique attributes of our operations versus our peers is our diversification outside the us approximately of our consolidated revenue during was generated outside the us and puerto rico  predominately in the uk the uk is the third largest retail automotive market in western europe 
our brand mix in the uk is predominantly premium 
we believe that as of december   we were among the largest audi  bentley  bmw  ferrari  land rover  lexus  mercedes benz  maserati and porsche dealers in the uk based on new unit sales 

table of contents additionally  we operate a number of dealerships in germany  western europe s largest retail automotive market  including through joint ventures with experienced local partners  which sell and service audi  bmw  lexus  mini  porsche  toyota  volkswagen and various other premium brands

expand revenues at existing locations and increase higher margin businesses increase same store sales 
we believe our emphasis on superior customer service and premium facilities will contribute to increases in same store sales over time 
we have added a significant number of incremental service bays in recent years in order to better accommodate our customers and further enhance our higher margin service and parts revenues 
we have employed a strategy called retail first to increase our same store used vehicle sales 
under this approach  we have increased our efforts to retail a vehicle to a consumer before attempting to dispose of it through the traditional wholesale process 
we believe this approach has helped to increase the number of used retail vehicle sales in grow finance  insurance  and other aftermarket revenues 
each sale of a vehicle provides us the opportunity to assist in financing the sale of a vehicle  to sell the customer an extended service contract or other insurance product  and to sell aftermarket products  such as security systems and protective coatings 
in order to improve our finance and insurance business  we focus on enhancing and standardizing our salesperson training programs through a menu driven product offering  and strengthening our product offerings 
expand service and parts and collision repair revenues 
today s vehicles are increasingly complex and require sophisticated equipment and specially trained technicians to perform certain services 
unlike independent service shops  our dealerships are authorized to perform this work under warranties provided by manufacturers 
we believe that our brand mix and the complexity of today s vehicles  combined with our investment in expanded service facilities and our focus on customer service  will contribute to increases in our service and parts revenue 
we also operate collision repair centers which are integrated with local dealership operations 
we also offer rapid repair services such as paint less dent repair  headlight reconditioning  wheel repairs  tire sales and windshield replacement at most of our facilities in order to offer our customers the convenience of one stop shopping for all of their automotive requirements 
grow through targeted acquisitions we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities exist for well capitalized dealership groups with experience in identifying  acquiring and integrating dealerships 
the fragmented automotive retail market provides us with significant growth opportunities in our markets 
we generally seek to acquire dealerships with high growth automotive brands in highly concentrated or growing demographic areas that will benefit from our management expertise  manufacturer relations and scale of operations  as well as smaller  single location dealerships that can be effectively integrated into our existing operations 
over time  we have also been awarded new franchises from various manufacturers 
in  we acquired franchises which we estimate will generate approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis 
in addition  in january  we acquired the agnew group of dealerships in the uk which we expect to generate approximately million of additional annualized revenues 
we also divested or classified as discontinued operations franchises that generated approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis in

we monitor customer satisfaction data accumulated by manufacturers to track the performance of dealership operations  and incent our personnel to provide exceptional customer service and customer loyalty 
leverage scale and implement best practices we seek to build scale in many of the markets where we have dealership operations 
our desire is to reduce or eliminate redundant administrative costs such as accounting  information technology systems and other general administrative costs 
in addition  we seek to leverage our industry knowledge and experience to foster communication and cooperation between like brand dealerships throughout our organization 
senior management and dealership management meet regularly to review dealership operating performance  examine industry trends  and implement operating improvements 
key financial information is discussed and compared between dealerships across all markets 
this frequent interaction facilitates implementation of successful strategies throughout the organization 
leverage internet marketing we intend to leverage the internet to attract and retain customers as we believe the majority of our customers consult the internet for information when shopping for a vehicle 
in order to attract customers and enhance our customer service  each of our dealerships maintains its own website 
all of our dealership websites are presented in common formats except where otherwise required by manufacturers which helps to minimize costs and provides a consistent image across dealerships 
in addition  many automotive manufacturers websites  and our corporate websites  provide links to our dealership websites and  in the uk  manufacturers also provide a website for the dealership 
in addition  we list substantially all our us and us vehicle inventory on www

these sites  together with our dealership websites  provide consumers a simple method to schedule maintenance and repair services at their local penske automotive dealership and view extensive vehicle information  including photos  prices  promotions  videos and third party vehicle history reports for pre owned vehicles

our dealerships finance the purchase of most new vehicles from the manufacturers through floor plan financing provided primarily by various manufacturers captive finance companies 
used vehicle retail sales 
in  we sold  used vehicles  which generated of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit 
we acquire used vehicles from various sources  including auctions open only to authorized new vehicle dealers  public auctions  trade ins from consumers in connection with their purchase of a new vehicle from us and lease expirations or terminations 
to improve customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory  each of our dealerships participates in all available manufacturer certification processes for used vehicles 
if certification is obtained  the used vehicle owner is typically provided benefits and warranties similar to those offered to new vehicle owners by the applicable manufacturer 
several of our dealerships have implemented software tools which assist in procuring and selling used vehicles 
through our scale in certain us markets  we have implemented closed bid auctions that allow us to bring a large number of vehicles we do not intend to retail to a central market for other dealers or wholesalers to purchase 
in the uk  we offer used vehicles to wholesalers and other dealers via online auction 
we have employed a strategy called retail first to increase our same store used vehicle sales 
under this approach  we have increased our efforts to retail a vehicle 
table of contents to a consumer before attempting to dispose of it through the traditional wholesale process 
we believe this approach has helped to increase the number of used retail vehicles sales in we believe these strategies have resulted in greater operating efficiency and helped to reduce costs associated with maintaining optimal inventories 
vehicle finance  extended service and insurance sales 
finance and insurance sales represented of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit in at our customers option  our dealerships can arrange third party financing or leasing in connection with vehicle purchases 
we typically receive a portion of the cost of the financing or leasing paid by the customer for each transaction as a fee 
while these services are generally non recourse to us  we are subject to chargebacks in certain circumstances  such as default under a financing arrangement or prepayment 
these chargebacks vary by finance product but typically are limited to the fee we receive 
we also offer our customers various vehicle warranty and extended protection products  including extended service contracts  maintenance programs  guaranteed auto protection known as gap  this protection covers the shortfall between a customer s loan balance and insurance payoff in the event of a total loss  lease wear and tear insurance and theft protection products

service and parts sales 
service and parts sales represented of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit in we generate service and parts sales in connection with warranty and non warranty work performed at each of our dealerships 
we believe our service and parts revenues benefit from the increasingly complex technology used in vehicles that makes it difficult for independent repair facilities to maintain and repair today s automobiles 
a goal of each of our dealerships is to make each vehicle purchaser a customer of our service and parts department 
our dealerships keep detailed records of our customers maintenance and service histories  and many dealerships send reminders to customers when vehicles are due for periodic maintenance or service 
many of our dealerships have extended evening and weekend service hours for the convenience of our customers 
we also offer rapid repair services such as paint less dent repair  headlight reconditioning  wheel repairs  tire sales and windshield replacement at most of our facilities in order to offer our customers the convenience of one stop shopping for all of their automotive requirements

dealership data is gathered and processed through individual dealer systems utilizing a common management system licensed from a third party 
each dealership is allowed to tailor the operational capabilities of that system locally  but we require that they follow our standardized accounting procedures 
our database technology allows us to extract and aggregate information from the system in a consistent format to generate consolidating financial and operational data 
the system also allows us to access detailed information for each dealership individually  as a group  or on a consolidated basis 
information we can access includes  among other things  inventory  cash  unit sales  the mix of new and used vehicle sales and sales of aftermarket products and services 
our ability to access this data allows us to continually analyze these dealerships results of operations and financial position so as to identify areas for improvement 
our technology and processes also enable us to quickly integrate dealerships or dealership groups we acquire in the us 
table of contents our uk dealership financial  accounting and operational data is processed through a standard management system licensed from a third party  except when otherwise required by the manufacturer 
financial and operational information is aggregated following us policies and accounting requirements  and is reported in our us reporting format to ensure consistency of results among our worldwide operations 
similar to the us  the us technology and processes enable us to continually analyze these dealerships results of operations and financial position so as to identify areas for improvement and to quickly integrate dealerships or dealership groups we acquire in the uk marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our retail operations 
we utilize many different media for our marketing activities  focusing on the internet and other digital media  including our own websites such as www 
penskecars 
com and www 
sytner 
co 
uk as discussed above under leverage internet marketing 
we also utilize newspaper  direct mail  magazine  television  and radio advertising 
automobile manufacturers supplement our local and regional advertising efforts through large advertising campaigns promoting their brands and promoting attractive financing packages and other incentive programs they may offer 
in an effort to realize increased efficiencies  we are focusing on common marketing metrics and business practices across our dealerships  as well as negotiating enterprise arrangements for targeted marketing resources 
agreements with vehicle manufacturers we operate our dealerships under separate agreements with the manufacturers or distributors of each brand of vehicle sold at that dealership 
these agreements are typical throughout the industry and may contain provisions and standards governing almost every aspect of the dealership  including ownership  management  personnel  training  maintenance of a minimum of working capital  net worth requirements  maintenance of minimum lines of credit  advertising and marketing activities  facilities  signs  products and services  maintenance of minimum amounts of insurance  achievement of minimum customer service standards and monthly financial reporting 
in addition  the general manager and or the owner of a dealership typically cannot be changed without the manufacturer s consent 
in exchange for complying with these provisions and standards  we are granted the non exclusive right to sell the manufacturer s or distributors brand of vehicles and related parts and warranty services at our dealership 
the agreements also grant us a non exclusive license to use each manufacturer s trademarks  service marks and designs in connection with our sales and service of its brand at our dealership 
some of our agreements  including those with bmw  honda  mercedes benz and toyota  expire after a specified period of time ranging from one to six years 
manufacturers have generally not terminated our franchise agreements  and our franchise agreements with fixed terms have typically been renewed without substantial cost 
we currently expect the manufacturers to renew all of our franchise agreements as they expire 
in addition  certain agreements with the manufacturers limit the total number of dealerships of that brand that we may own in a particular geographic area and  in some cases  limit the total number of their vehicles that we may sell as a percentage of a particular manufacturer s overall sales 
manufacturers may also limit the ownership of stores in contiguous markets 
to date  we have reached the limit of the number of lexus dealerships we may own in the us  and we have reached certain geographical limitations with certain manufacturers in the us and us where these limits are reached  we cannot acquire additional franchises of those brands in the relevant market unless we can negotiate modifications to the agreements 
we may not be able to negotiate any such modifications 
many of these agreements also grant the manufacturer or distributor a security interest in the vehicles and or parts sold by them to the dealership  as well as other dealership assets  and permit them to terminate or not renew the agreement for a variety of causes  including failure to adequately operate the dealership  insolvency or bankruptcy  impairment of the dealer s reputation or financial standing  changes in the dealership s management  owners or location without consent  sales of the dealership s assets without consent  failure to maintain adequate 
table of contents working capital or floor plan financing  changes in the dealership s financial or other condition  failure to submit required information to them on a timely basis  failure to have any permit or license necessary to operate the dealership  and material breaches of other provisions of the agreement 
in the us  these termination rights are subject to state franchise laws that limit a manufacturer s right to terminate a franchise 
in the uk  we operate without such local franchise law protection see regulation below 
our agreements with manufacturers or distributors usually give them the right  in some circumstances including upon a merger  sale  or change of control of the company  or in some cases a material change in our business or capital structure  to acquire from us  at fair market value  the dealerships 
for example  our agreement with general motors provides that  upon a proposed purchase of or more of our voting stock by any new person or entity or another manufacturer subject to certain exceptions  an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger  reorganization or sale of a material amount of assets or a change of control of our board of directors  general motors has the right to acquire all assets  properties and business of any general motors dealership owned by us for fair value 
some of our agreements with other major manufacturers  including honda and toyota  contain provisions similar to the general motors provisions 
competition the automotive retail industry is currently served by franchised automotive dealerships  independent used vehicle dealerships and individual consumers who sell used vehicles in private transactions 
for new vehicle sales  we compete primarily with other franchised dealers in each of our marketing areas  relying on our premium facilities  advertising and merchandising  management experience  sales expertise  service reputation and the location of our dealerships to attract and retain customers 
each of our markets may include a number of well capitalized competitors  including in certain instances dealerships owned by automotive manufacturers and national and regional automotive retail chains 
we also compete with dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and with dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not represent in a particular market 
our new vehicle dealership competitors have franchise agreements which gives them access to new vehicles on the same terms as us 
automotive dealers also face competition in the sale of new vehicles from on line purchasing services and warehouse clubs 
with respect to arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions such as banks and local credit unions 
for used vehicle sales  we compete with other franchised dealers  independent used vehicle dealers  automobile rental agencies  on line purchasing services  private parties and used vehicle superstores for the procurement and resale of used vehicles 
we believe that the principal factors consumers consider when determining where to purchase a vehicle are the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers  the ability of dealerships to offer a wide selection of the most popular vehicles  the location of dealerships and the quality of the customer experience 
other factors include customer preference for particular brands of automobiles  pricing including manufacturer rebates and other special offers and warranties 
we believe that our dealerships are competitive in all of these areas 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automotive dealers  franchised and non franchised service center chains  and independent garages for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automotive dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal factors consumers consider when determining where to purchase vehicle parts and service are price  the use of factory approved replacement parts  facility location  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
we believe the majority of consumers are utilizing the internet and other digital media in connection with the purchase of new and used vehicles 
accordingly  we face increased competition from on line automotive 
table of contents websites  including those developed by automobile manufacturers and other dealership groups 
consumers can use the internet and other digital media to compare prices for vehicles and related services  which may result in reduced margins for new vehicles  used vehicles and related services 
employees and labor relations as of december   we employed approximately  people  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor unions 
we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
our policy is to motivate our key managers through  among other things  variable compensation programs tied principally to dealership profitability 
due to our reliance on vehicle manufacturers  we may be adversely affected by labor strikes or work stoppages at the manufacturers facilities 
regulation we operate in a highly regulated industry and a number of regulations affect the marketing  selling  financing and servicing of automobiles 
under the laws of the jurisdictions in which we currently operate  we typically must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our advertising  operating  financing  employment and sales practices 
other laws and regulations include franchise laws and regulations  environmental laws and regulations see environmental matters below  laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers  as well as privacy  identity theft prevention  wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws 
our financing activities with customers are subject to truth in lending  consumer leasing  equal credit opportunity and similar regulations  as well as motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  insurance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales 
in recent years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the us have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
in the us  we benefit from the protection of numerous state franchise laws that generally provide that a manufacturer or distributor may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state franchise laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
europe generally does not have these laws and  as a result  our european dealerships operate without these types of protections 
however  current european rules limit automotive manufacturers block exemption to certain anti competitive rules in regards to establishing and maintaining a retail network 
as a result  existing manufacturer authorized retailers are able to  subject to manufacturer facility requirements  relocate or add additional facilities throughout the european union  offer multiple brands in the same facility  allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on transfers of dealerships between existing franchisees within the european union 
in june  the european rules will change such that the authorized retailers abilities will be more limited 
we do not currently believe that the rule changes will have a material affect on us 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the operation and removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks  the use  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other materials and the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination 
as with automotive dealerships generally  and service  parts and body shop operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and contracting for recycling or 
table of contents disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes  including environmentally sensitive materials such as motor oil  filters  transmission fluid  antifreeze  refrigerant  batteries  solvents  lubricants  and fuel 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
our operations involving the management of hazardous and other environmentally sensitive materials are subject to numerous requirements 
our business also involves the operation of storage tanks containing such materials 
storage tanks are subject to periodic testing  containment  upgrading and removal under applicable law 
furthermore  investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks 
in addition  water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations 
similarly  certain air emissions from our operations  such as auto body painting  may be subject to relevant laws 
various health and safety standards also apply to our operations 
we may have liability in connection with materials that are sent to third party recycling  treatment  and or disposal facilities under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and comparable statutes 
these statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where the contamination occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at these sites 
an expanding trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards  which will increase substantially through furthermore  in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases  referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  climate change related legislation and policy changes to restrict greenhouse gas emissions are being considered at state and federal levels 
significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide on vehicles and automobile fuels in the us could adversely affect prices of and demand for the vehicles that we sell 
we believe that we do not have any material environmental liabilities and that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material effect on us 
however  soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain of our current or former properties 
further  environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
in addition  in connection with our acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
compliance with current  amended  new or more stringent laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us  and such expenditures could be material 
insurance the automotive retail industry is subject to substantial risk of loss due to the significant concentration of property values at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
in addition  we are exposed to liabilities arising out of our operations  including claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
we attempt to manage such risks through insurance programs  including umbrella and excess insurance policies  subject to specified deductibles and significant loss retentions 
as a result  we are exposed to uninsured and underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on us

we are incorporated in the state of delaware and began dealership operations in october seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  prospects  and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the matters discussed below 
certain statements and information set forth herein  as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  seeks  projects  will  would  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we set forth this statement in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions 
you should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
although we believe that the expectations  plans  intentions  and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable  such statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
the risks  uncertainties  and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include the following macro economic conditions 
our performance is impacted by general economic conditions overall  and in particular by economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
these economic conditions include levels of new and used vehicle sales  availability of consumer credit  changes in consumer demand  consumer 
table of contents confidence levels  fuel prices  personal discretionary spending levels  interest rates  and unemployment rates 
when the worldwide economy faltered and the worldwide automotive industry experienced significant operational and financial difficulties in and  we were adversely affected  and we expect a similar relationship between general economic and industry conditions and our performance in the future 
automotive manufacturers exercise significant control over us 
each of our dealerships operates under franchise and other agreements with automotive manufacturers or related distributors 
these agreements govern almost every aspect of the operation of our dealerships  and give manufacturers the discretion to terminate or not renew our franchise agreements for a variety of reasons  including certain events outside our control such as accumulation of our stock by third parties 
without franchise agreements  we would be unable to sell new vehicles or perform manufacturer authorized warranty service 
if a significant number of our franchise agreements are terminated or are not renewed  we would be materially affected 
restructuring  bankruptcy or other adverse condition affecting a significant automotive manufacturer or supplier 
our success depends on the overall success of the automotive industry generally  and in particular on the success of the brands of vehicles that each of our dealerships sell 
in  revenue generated at our bmw mini  audi volkswagen bentley  toyota lexus scion  honda acura  and mercedes benz sprinter smart dealerships represented     and  respectively  of our total revenues 
significant adverse events  such as the reduced new vehicle production by japanese automotive manufacturers caused by the significant production and supply chain disruptions resulting from the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan on march   or future events that interrupt vehicle or parts supply to our dealerships  would likely have a significant and adverse impact on the industry as a whole  including us  particularly if the events relate to any of the manufacturers whose franchises generate a significant percentage of our revenue 
our business is very competitive 
we generally compete with other franchised automotive dealerships in our markets  private market buyers and sellers of used vehicles  internet based vehicle brokers  national and local service and repair shops and parts retailers  and automotive manufacturers in certain markets 
purchase decisions by consumers when shopping for a vehicle are extremely price sensitive 
the level of competition in the market generally  coupled with increasing price transparency resulting from increased use of the internet by consumers  can lead to lower selling prices and related profits 
if there is a prolonged drop in retail prices  new vehicle sales are allowed to be made over the internet without the involvement of franchised dealers  or if dealerships are able to effectively use the internet to sell outside of their markets  our business could be materially adversely affected 
property loss  business interruption or other liabilities 
our business is subject to substantial risk of loss due to the significant concentration of property values  including vehicle and parts inventories  at our operating locations  claims by employees  customers and third parties for personal injury or property damage  and fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
while we have insurance for many of these risks  we retain risk relating to certain of these perils and certain perils are not covered by our insurance 
if we experience significant losses that are not covered by our insurance  whether due to adverse weather conditions or otherwise  or we are required to retain a significant portion of a loss  it could have a significant and adverse effect on us 
leverage 
our significant debt and other commitments expose us to a number of risks  including cash requirements for debt and lease obligations 
a significant portion of the cash flow we generate must be used to service the interest and principal payments relating to our various financial commitments  including billion of floor plan notes payable  million of long term debt and billion of future lease commitments including extension periods and assuming constant consumer price indices 
a sustained or significant decrease in our operating cash flows could lead to an inability to meet our debt service requirements or to a failure to meet specified financial and operating covenants included in certain of our agreements 
if this were to occur  it may lead to a default under one or more of our commitments and potentially the acceleration of amounts due  which could have a significant and adverse effect on us 

table of contents availability 
because we finance the majority of our operating and strategic initiatives using a variety of commitments  including floor plan notes payable and revolving credit facilities  we are dependent on continued availability of these sources of funds 
if these agreements are terminated or we are unable to access them because of a breach of financial or operating covenants or otherwise  we will likely be materially affected 
interest rate variability 
the interest rates we are charged on a substantial portion of our debt  including the floor plan notes payable we issue to purchase the majority of our inventory  are variable  increasing or decreasing based on changes in certain published interest rates 
increases to such interest rates would likely result in significantly higher interest expense for us  which would negatively affect our operating results 
because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases  increased interest rates may also decrease vehicle sales  which would negatively affect our operating results 
international operations 
we have significant operations outside the us that expose us to changes in foreign exchange rates and to the impact of economic and political conditions in the markets where we operate 
as exchange rates fluctuate  our results of operations as reported in us dollars fluctuate 
for example  if the us dollar were to strengthen against the uk pound  our uk results of operations would translate into less us dollar reported results 
any significant or prolonged increase in the value of the us dollar  particularly as compared to the uk pound  could result in a significant and adverse effect on our reported results 
joint ventures 
we have significant investments in a variety of joint ventures  including retail automotive operations in germany and a limited partnership interest in ptl 
we expect to receive annual operating distributions from each such venture  and  in the case of ptl  to realize us tax savings as a result of our investment 
these benefits may not be realized if the joint ventures do not perform as expected  or if changes in tax  financial or regulatory requirements negatively impact the results of the joint venture operations 
our ability to dispose of these investments may be limited 
in addition  because ptl is engaged in different businesses than we are  its performance may vary significantly from ours 
performance of sublessees 
in connection with the sale  relocation and closure of certain of our franchises  we have entered into a number of third party sublease agreements 
the rent paid by our sub tenants on such properties in totaled approximately million 
in the aggregate  we remain ultimately liable for approximately million of such lease payments including payments relating to all available renewal periods 
we rely on our sub tenants to pay the rent and maintain the properties covered by these leases 
in the event a subtenant does not perform under the terms of their lease with us  we could be required to fulfill such obligations  which could have a significant and adverse effect on us 
information technology 
our information systems are fully integrated into our operations  including electronic communications and data transfer protocols with manufacturers and other vendors  customer relationship management  sales and service scheduling  data storage  and financial and operational reporting 
the majority of our systems are licensed from third parties  the most significant of which are provided by one supplier in the us and one supplier in the us to the extent these systems become unavailable to us for any reason  or if our relationship deteriorates with either of our two principal suppliers  we may not be able to negotiate agreements to secure those or similar services on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  and our business could be significantly disrupted 
in addition  to the extent our systems are subject to intentional attacks or unintentional events that allow unauthorized access that disrupts our systems  our business could be significantly disrupted 
key personnel 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management  and in particular upon roger penske who is our chairman and chief executive officer 
to the extent mr 
penske  or other key personnel  were to depart from our company unexpectedly  our business could be significantly disrupted 

table of contents regulatory issues 
we are subject to a wide variety of regulatory activities  including governmental regulations  claims and legal proceedings 
governmental regulations affect almost every aspect of our business  including the fair treatment of our employees  wage and hour issues  and our financing activities with customers 
in the event of regulation restricting our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers  we could be adversely affected 
we could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law which may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings  may expose us to substantial monetary damages which may adversely affect us 
franchise laws in the us in the us  state law generally provides protections to franchised automotive dealers from discriminatory practices by manufacturers and from unreasonable termination or non renewal of their franchise agreements 
if these franchise laws are repealed or amended  manufacturers may have greater flexibility to terminate or not renew our franchises 
franchised automotive dealers in the european union operate without such protections 
environmental regulations 
we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the operation and removal of storage tanks  and the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
in the normal course of our operations we use  generate and dispose of materials covered by these laws and regulations 
we face potentially significant costs relating to claims  penalties and remediation efforts in the event of non compliance with existing and future laws and regulations 
accounting rules and regulations 
the financial accounting standards board is currently evaluating several significant changes to generally accepted accounting standards in the us  including the rules governing the accounting for leases 
any such changes could significantly affect our reported financial position  earnings and cash flows 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission is currently considering adopting rules that would require us to prepare our financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards  which could also result in significant changes to our reported financial position  earnings and cash flows 
related parties 
our two largest stockholders  penske corporation and its affiliates penske corporation and mitsui co and its affiliates mitsui  together beneficially own of our outstanding common stock 
the presence of such significant shareholders results in several risks  including our principal stockholders have substantial influence 
penske corporation and mitsui have entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote together as to the election of our directors 
as a result  penske corporation has the ability to control the composition of our board of directors  which may allow them to control our affairs and business 
this concentration of ownership  coupled with certain provisions contained in our agreements with manufacturers  our certificate of incorporation  and our bylaws  could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us 
some of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests 
roger penske  our chairman and chief executive officer and a director  and robert h 
kurnick  jr  our president and a director  hold the same offices at penske corporation 
each of these officers is paid much of their compensation by penske corporation 
the compensation they receive from us is based on their efforts on our behalf  however  they are not required to spend any specific amount of time on our matters 
one of our directors  richard j 
peters also serves as a director of penske corporation 
penske corporation has pledged its shares of common stock to secure a loan facility 
penske corporation has pledged all of its shares of our common stock as collateral to secure a loan facility 
a default by penske corporation could result in the foreclosure on those shares by the lenders  after which the lenders could attempt to sell those shares on the open market 
any such change in ownership and or sale could materially impact the market price of our common stock 
see below penske corporation ownership levels 

table of contents penske corporation ownership levels 
certain of our agreements have clauses that are triggered in the event of a material change in the level of ownership of our common stock by penske corporation  such as our trademark agreement between us and penske corporation that governs our use of the penske name which can be terminated months after the date that penske corporation no longer owns at least of our voting stock 
we may not be able to renegotiate such agreements on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all  in the event of a significant change in penske corporation s ownership 
we have a significant number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale 
penske corporation and mitsui own of our common stock and each has two demand registration rights that could result in a substantial number of shares being introduced for sale in the market 
we also have a significant amount of authorized but unissued shares 
the introduction of any of these shares into the market could have a material adverse effect our stock price

we believe that our facilities are sufficient for our needs and are in good repair 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation which may relate to claims brought by governmental authorities  customers  vendors  or employees  including class action claims and purported class action claims 
we are not a party to any legal proceedings  including class action lawsuits  that individually or in the aggregate  are reasonably expected to have a material effect on us

we are a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the direct or indirect ownership of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings and other advances and payments to us 
also  pursuant to the automobile franchise agreements to which our dealerships are subject  our dealerships are generally required to maintain a certain amount of working capital  which could limit our subsidiaries ability to pay us dividends

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements 
we have acquired and initiated a number of businesses since inception 
our financial statements include the results of operations of those businesses from the date acquired or when they commenced operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been updated to reflect the revision of our financial statements for entities which have been treated as discontinued operations through december  overview we are the second largest automotive retailer headquartered in the us as measured by the billion in total revenue we generated in as of december   we operated retail automotive franchises  of which franchises are located in the us and franchises are located outside of the us the franchises outside the us are located primarily in the uk in  we retailed and wholesaled more than  vehicles 
we are diversified geographically  with of our total revenues in generated in the us and puerto rico and generated outside the us we offer approximately vehicle brands  with of our total retail revenue in generated from brands of non us based manufacturers  and generated from premium brands  such as audi  bmw  mercedes benz and porsche 
each of our dealerships offers a wide selection of new and used vehicles for sale 
in addition to selling new and used vehicles  we generate higher margin revenue at each of our dealerships through maintenance and repair services and the sale and placement of higher margin products  such as third party finance and insurance products  third party extended service contracts and replacement and aftermarket automotive products 
we also own a limited partnership interest in penske truck leasing co  lp ptl  a leading global transportation services provider 
ptl leases  rents and maintains more than  vehicles and serves customers in north america  south america  europe and asia and is one of the largest purchasers of commercial trucks in north america through its approximately  corporate and  agent locations 
product lines include full service leasing  contract maintenance  commercial and consumer truck rentals  used truck sales  transportation and warehousing management and supply chain management solutions 
the general partner of ptl is penske truck leasing corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of penske corporation  which  together with other wholly owned subsidiaries of penske corporation  owns of ptl 
the remaining of ptl is owned by general electric capital corporation 
in  smart usa distributor  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed the sale of certain assets and the transfer of certain liabilities relating to the distribution rights  management  sales and marketing activities of smart usa to daimler vehicle innovations llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mercedes benz usa 
the final aggregate cash purchase price for the assets was million 
as a result  smart usa has been treated as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
outlook the level of new automotive unit sales in our markets impacts our results 
the new vehicle market and the amount of customer traffic visiting our dealerships has improved during and  though the level of automotive sales in the us remains below the last years average sales level 
there are market expectations for continued improvement in the automotive market in the us over the next several years  although the level of such improvement is uncertain 
during  million cars and light trucks were sold in the us  representing a improvement over the million cars and light trucks sold during the same period last year 
we believe the us automotive market will continue to recover based upon industry forecasts from companies such as jd power  coupled with demand in the marketplace  an aging vehicle population  increased availability  and lower cost  of credit for consumers  and the planned introduction of new models by many different vehicle brands 
vehicle registrations in the u 
k were million in compared to million in  representing a decline of 
according to the society of motor manufacturers and traders www

co 
uk  the uk market is expected to be challenging in as the economic outlook remains uncertain  however  in  
table of contents vehicle registrations of premium brands such as audi  bentley  bmw  jaguar  land rover  lexus  mercedes benz  mini and porsche increased  indicating that registrations of premium luxury vehicles have been more resilient than the market as a whole 
operating overview new and used vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of third party extended service contracts  sales of third party insurance policies  commissions relating to the sale of finance and lease contracts to third parties and the sales of certain other products 
service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair  maintenance and collision services  and the sale of replacement parts and other aftermarket accessories 
our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and service and parts transactions 
our gross profit varies across product lines  with vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other revenues resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as inventory and vehicle availability  customer demand  consumer confidence  unemployment  general economic conditions  seasonality  weather  credit availability  fuel prices and manufacturers advertising and incentives also impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 
aggregate gross profit increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the same period in prior year 
the increase in gross profit is largely attributable to the increase in same store retail revenue 
our retail gross margin percentage declined from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   due primarily to an increase in the percentage of our revenues generated by used vehicle sales which carry a lower gross margin than other parts of our business 
our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  rent  insurance  utilities  and other expenses 
as the majority of our selling expenses are variable  and we believe a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  we believe our expenses can be adjusted over time to reflect economic trends 
floor plan interest expense relates to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories that is secured by those vehicles 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
the cost of our variable rate indebtedness is based on the prime rate  defined london interbank offered rate libor  the bank of england base rate  the finance house base rate  or the euro interbank offered rate 
our floor plan interest expense has decreased during the year ended december  as a result of lower applicable interest rates  including the impact of the expiration of interest rate swap transactions 
our other interest expense has decreased during the year ended december  due to repurchases of our senior subordinated convertible notes and term loan repayments offset by increased average borrowings under the revolving us credit facility 
equity in earnings of affiliates represents our share of the earnings from our investments in joint ventures and other non consolidated investments  including ptl 
it is our expectation that operating conditions as outlined above in the outlook section will similarly impact these businesses throughout however  because ptl is engaged in different businesses than we are  its operating performance may vary significantly from ours 
the future success of our business is dependent upon  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions  the level of vehicle sales in the markets where we operate  our ability to increase sales of higher margin products  especially service and parts services  our ability to realize returns on our significant capital investment in new and upgraded dealership facilities and the return realized from our investments in various joint ventures and other non consolidated investments

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve making estimates and employing judgments 
such judgments influence the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized in our financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews these estimates and assumptions 
management may determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are required  which may result in a material change in our results of operations or financial position 
the following are the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition vehicle  parts and service sales we record revenue when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the customer  when vehicle service or repair work is completed and when parts are delivered to our customers 
sales promotions that we offer to customers are accounted for as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
rebates and other incentives offered directly to us by manufacturers are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales 
reimbursements of qualified advertising expenses are treated as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amounts received under certain manufacturer rebate and incentive programs are based on the attainment of program objectives  and such earnings are recognized either upon the sale of the vehicle for which the award was received  or upon attainment of the particular program goals if not associated with individual vehicles 
during the years ended december    and  we earned million  million  and million  respectively  of rebates  incentives and reimbursements from manufacturers  of which million  million  and million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
finance and insurance sales subsequent to the sale of a vehicle to a customer  we sell installment sale contracts to various financial institutions on a non recourse basis with specified exceptions to mitigate the risk of default 
we receive a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rate charged to the customer and the interest rate set by the financing institution or a flat fee 
we also receive commissions for facilitating the sale of various third party insurance products to customers  including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts 
these commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract 
impairment testing franchise value impairment is assessed as of october every year and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment through a comparison of its carrying amount and estimated fair value 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying value of a franchise exceeds its estimated fair value and an impairment loss may be recognized up to that excess 
the fair value of franchise value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions about revenue and profitability growth  franchise profit margins  and our cost of capital 
we also evaluate our franchise agreements in connection with the annual impairment testing to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support our assessment that the franchise agreements have an indefinite life 
goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level as of october every year and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment 
the company s operations are organized by management into operating segments by line of business and geography 
the company has determined it has two reportable segments as defined in generally accepted accounting principles for segment reporting  including i retail  consisting of our automotive retail operations and ii pag investments  consisting of our investments in businesses other than automotive retail operations 
we have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments within the retail reportable segment are components that are aggregated into four 
table of contents geographical reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  as they a have similar economic characteristics all are automotive dealerships having similar margins  b offer similar products and services all sell new and used vehicles  service  parts and third party finance and insurance products  c have similar target markets and customers generally individuals and d have similar distribution and marketing practices all distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar fashions 
there is no goodwill recorded in our pag investments reportable segment 
in september  the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment 
this update permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt the qualitative assessment 
investments we account for each of our investments under the equity method  pursuant to which we record our proportionate share of the investee s income each period 
the net book value of our investments was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
investments for which there is not a liquid  actively traded market are reviewed periodically by management for indicators of impairment 
if an indicator of impairment is identified  management estimates the fair value of the investment using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions relating to revenue and profitability growth  profit margins and our cost of capital 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary may result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
self insurance we retain risk relating to certain of our general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  auto physical damage insurance  property insurance  employment practices liability insurance  directors and officers insurance and employee medical benefits in the us as a result  we are likely to be responsible for a significant portion of the claims and losses incurred under these programs 
the amount of risk we retain varies by program  and  for certain exposures  we have pre determined maximum loss limits for certain individual claims and or insurance periods 
losses  if any  above the pre determined loss limits are paid by third party insurance carriers 
our estimate of future losses is prepared by management using our historical loss experience and industry based development factors 
aggregate reserves relating to retained risk were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes in the reserve estimate during relate primarily to our general liability and workers compensation programs 
income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as the timing of depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years which we have already recorded in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions taken on our tax returns that have not yet been recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to allow for the use of the deduction or credit 
we do not provide for us taxes relating to undistributed earnings or losses of our foreign subsidiaries 
income from continuing operations before income taxes of foreign subsidiaries which subsidiaries are predominately in the uk was million  million  and million during the years ended 
table of contents december   and  respectively 
it is our belief that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the companies that produced them 
at december   we have not provided us federal income taxes on a total of approximately million of earnings of individual foreign subsidiaries 
if these earnings were remitted as dividends  we would be subject to us income taxes in excess of foreign taxes paid and certain foreign withholding taxes 
classification in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results of our operations in our consolidated financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles relating to discontinued operations  which requires judgments  including whether a business will be divested  whether the cash flows will be replaced  the period required to complete the divestiture  and the likelihood of changes to the divestiture plans 
if we determine that a business should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are revised to reflect such reclassification 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which requires the presentation of components of other comprehensive income with the components of net income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we will adopt this update for periods beginning after december  while this will affect the presentation of comprehensive income  we do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment  amending the guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
this update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
this is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test and is considered a preliminary step in determining whether it is necessary to calculate a fair value for a reporting unit 
we elected to early adopt the provisions of this update by preparing a qualitative assessment for the period ending december  the adoption of this update had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following tables present comparative financial data relating to our operating performance in the aggregate and on a same store basis

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  inventory financing  the acquisition of new businesses  the improvement and expansion of existing facilities  the purchase or construction of new facilities  debt service and repayments  and potentially for dividends and repurchases of our outstanding securities under the program discussed below 
historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements  the issuance of debt securities  sale leaseback transactions  mortgages  dividends and distributions from joint venture investments or the issuance of equity securities 
we have historically expanded our retail automotive operations through organic growth and the acquisition of retail automotive dealerships 
we believe that cash flow from operations  dividends and distributions from our joint venture investments and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
in the event we pursue significant acquisitions  other expansion opportunities  significant repurchases of our outstanding securities  or refinance or repay existing debt  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings  which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  our liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event we fail to comply with the covenants under our various financing and operating agreements or in the event our floor plan financing is withdrawn

securities repurchases from time to time  our board of directors has authorized securities repurchase programs pursuant to which we may  as market conditions warrant  purchase our outstanding common stock  debt or convertible debt on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  via a tender offer  or through a pre arranged trading plan 
we have historically funded any such repurchases using cash flow from operations and borrowings under our us credit facility 
the decision to make repurchases will be based on factors such as the market price of the relevant security versus our view of its intrinsic value  the potential impact of such repurchases on our capital structure  and our consideration of any alternative uses of our capital  such as for strategic investments in our current businesses  in addition to any then existing limits imposed by our finance agreements and securities trading policy

inventory financing we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan arrangements with various lenders  including a majority through captive finance companies associated with automotive manufacturers 
in the us  the floor plan arrangements are due on demand  however  we have not historically been required to repay floor plan advances prior to the sale of the vehicles that have been financed 
we typically make monthly interest payments on the amount financed 
outside of the us  substantially all of our floor plan arrangements are payable on demand or have an original maturity of days or less and we are generally required to repay floor plan advances at the earlier of the sale of the vehicles that have been financed or the stated maturity 
the floor plan agreements typically grant a security interest in substantially all of the assets of our dealership subsidiaries  and in the us are guaranteed by us 
interest rates under the floor plan arrangements are variable and increase or decrease based on changes in the prime rate  defined libor  finance house base rate  or euro interbank offered rate

substantially all of the buildings and improvements on the properties financed pursuant to the mortgage facilities are subject to security interests granted to the lender 
as of december   we owed million of principal under our mortgage facilities 
short term borrowings we have three principal sources of short term borrowing the revolving portion of the us credit agreement  the revolving portion of the us credit agreement  and the floor plan agreements in place that we utilize to finance our vehicle inventories 
all of the cash generated in our operations is initially used to pay down our floor plan indebtedness 
over time  we are able to access availability under the floor plan agreements to fund our cash needs  including payments made relating to our higher interest rate revolving credit agreements 
during  outstanding revolving commitments varied between no balance and million under the us credit agreement and between million and million under the uk credit agreement s revolving credit line excluding the overdraft facility  and the amounts outstanding under our floor plan agreements varied based on the timing of the receipt and expenditure of cash in our operations  driven principally by the levels of our vehicle inventories 
interest rate swaps we periodically use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate floor plan debt 
we are party to forward starting interest rate swap agreements beginning january and maturing december pursuant to which the libor portion of million of our floating rate floor plan debt is fixed at a blended rate of 
we may terminate these agreements at any time  subject to the settlement of the then current fair value of the swap arrangements 
our prior interest rate swap agreements which fixed the libor portion of million of our floating rate floor plan debt at concluded in january ptl dividends we own a limited partnership interest in penske truck leasing 
during the years ended december    and  respectively  we received million  million  and million of pro rata cash distributions relating to this investment 
we currently expect to continue to receive future distributions from ptl subject in amount and timing on its performance 
operating leases we historically structured our operations so as to minimize our ownership of real property 
as a result  we lease or sublease substantially all of our facilities 
these leases are generally for a period between five and 
table of contents years  and are typically structured to include renewal options at our election 
we estimate our total rent obligations under these leases  including any extension periods we may exercise at our discretion and assuming constant consumer price indices  to be billion 
pursuant to the leases for some of our larger facilities  we are required to comply with specified financial ratios  including a rent coverage ratio and a debt to ebitda ratio  each as defined 
for these leases  non compliance with the ratios may require us to post collateral in the form of a letter of credit 
a breach of our other lease covenants give rise to certain remedies by the landlord  the most severe of which include the termination of the applicable lease and acceleration of the total rent payments due under the lease 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under these leases  and we believe we will remain in compliance with such covenants for the next twelve months 
sale leaseback arrangements we have in the past and may in the future enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance certain property acquisitions and capital expenditures  pursuant to which we sell property and or leasehold improvements to third parties and agree to lease those assets back for a certain period of time 
such sales generated proceeds which varied from period to period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have sold a number of dealerships to third parties and  as a condition to certain of those sales  remain liable for the lease payments relating to the properties on which those businesses operate in the event of non payment by the buyer 
we are also party to lease agreements on properties that we no longer use in our retail operations that we have sublet to third parties 
we rely on subtenants to pay the rent and maintain the property at these locations 
in the event a subtenant does not perform as expected  we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us and we could be required to fulfill these obligations 
we believe we have made appropriate reserves relating to these locations 
the aggregate rent paid by the tenants on those properties in was approximately million  and  in aggregate  we guarantee or are otherwise liable for approximately million of third party lease payments  including lease payments during available renewal periods 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased by million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major components of these changes are discussed below 
cash flows from continuing operating activities cash provided by continuing operating activities was million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
cash flows from continuing operating activities includes net income  as adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital 
we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan notes payable with various lenders 
we retain the right to select which  if any  financing source to utilize in connection with the procurement of vehicle inventories 
many vehicle manufacturers provide vehicle financing for the dealers representing their brands  however  it is not a requirement that we utilize this financing 
historically  our floor plan finance source has been based on aggregate pricing considerations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles relating to the statement of cash flows  we report all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable with the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows  and all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable to a party other than the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
currently  the majority of our non trade vehicle financing is with other manufacturer captive lenders 
to date  we have not experienced any material limitation with respect to the amount or availability of financing from any institution providing us vehicle financing 

table of contents we believe that changes in aggregate floor plan liabilities are typically linked to changes in vehicle inventory and  therefore  are an integral part of understanding changes in our working capital and operating cash flow 
as a result  we prepare the following reconciliation to highlight our operating cash flows with all changes in vehicle floor plan being classified as an operating activity for informational purposes year ended december  net cash from continuing operating activities as reported floor plan notes payable non trade as reported net cash from continuing operating activities including all floor plan notes payable cash flows from continuing investing activities cash used in continuing investing activities was million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
cash flows from continuing investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures  net expenditures for acquisitions and other investments  and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate primarily to improvements to our existing dealership facilities  the construction of new facilities and the acquisition of existing leased facilities 
as of december   we do not have material commitments related to our planned or ongoing capital projects 
we currently expect to finance our capital expenditures with operating cash flows or borrowings under our us or us credit facilities 
cash used in acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired  was million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  and included cash used to repay sellers floor plan liabilities in such business acquisitions of million  million  and million  respectively 
proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were million during the year ended december  cash flows from continuing financing activities cash provided by continuing financing activities was million during the year ended december   and cash used in continuing financing activities was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows from continuing financing activities include net borrowings or repayments of long term debt  repurchases of securities  net borrowings or repayments of floor plan notes payable non trade  payments of deferred financing costs  proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options  and dividends 
we had net borrowings of long term debt of million during the year ended december   which included borrowings on our us credit agreement revolving loans of million  net borrowing on other long term debt  primarily relating to our mortgage facilities  of million  partially offset by a repayment of million on our us credit agreement term loan 
we had net repayments of long term debt of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  which included repayments of million and million on our us credit agreement term loan 
during the years ended december   and  we used million  million and million to repurchase million  million and million aggregate principal amount  respectively  of our convertible notes 
we had net borrowings of floor plan notes payable non trade of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and net repayment of floor plan notes payable non trade of million during the year ended december  in and  we repurchased million and  shares of common stock  respectively  for million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we also paid million of cash dividends to our stockholders 
no cash dividends were paid to our stockholders during the years ended december  and 
table of contents cash flows from discontinued operations cash flows relating to discontinued operations are not currently considered  nor are they expected to be  material to our liquidity or our capital resources 
management does not believe that there are any material past  present or upcoming cash transactions relating to discontinued operations 
contractual payment obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december   except as otherwise noted 
the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of any relevant agreements 
future events  including acquisitions  divestitures  new or revised operating lease agreements  borrowings or repayments under our credit agreements and our floor plan arrangements  and purchases or refinancing of our securities could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
potential payments noted above under off balance sheet arrangements are excluded from this table 
total less than year to years to years more than years floorplan notes payable a long term debt obligations b operating lease commitments scheduled interest payments b c other liabilities d a floor plan notes payable are revolving financing arrangements 
payments are generally made as required pursuant to the floor plan borrowing agreements discussed above under inventory financing 
b interest and principal repayments under our million of senior subordinated notes due are reflected in the table above in the column entitled to years 
while these notes are not due until  the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash in c estimates of future variable rate interest payments under floor plan notes payable and our credit agreements are excluded due to our inability to estimate changes in interest rates in the future 
see inventory financing  us credit agreement  and us credit agreement above for a discussion of such variable rates 
d includes uncertain tax positions 
due to the subjective nature of our uncertain tax positions  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of payments arising in connection with the unrecognized tax benefits  however  as a result of the statute of limitations  we do not expect any of these payments to occur in more than years 
we have thus classified this as to years 
we expect that  other than for scheduled payments upon the maturity or termination dates of certain of our debt instruments  the amounts above will be funded through cash flow from operations 
in the case of payments upon the maturity or termination dates of our debt instruments  we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business or otherwise fund them from cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit agreements

table of contents cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  have been cyclical historically  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience periods of decline and recession similar to those experienced by the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk effects of inflation we believe that inflation rates over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services  however  we cannot be sure there will be no such effect in the future 
we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding debt 
outstanding revolving balances under our credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on a margin over defined libor or the bank of england base rate 
based on the amount outstanding under these facilities as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual other interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over the prime rate  defined libor  the finance house base rate  or the euro interbank offered rate 
during  and into january  the company was party to interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which the libor portion of million of the company s floating rate floor plan debt was fixed at 
in  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements beginning january and maturing december pursuant to which the libor portion of million of our floating rate floor plan debt is fixed at a rate of and million of our floating rate floor plan debt is fixed at a rate of 
based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments during the year ended december   including consideration of the notional value of the swap agreements  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual floor plan interest expense 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
these policies include the maintenance of our overall debt portfolio with targeted fixed and variable rate components  the use of authorized derivative instruments  the prohibition of using derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  and the prohibition of highly leveraged derivatives or derivatives which we are unable to reliably value  or for which we are unable to obtain a market quotation 
interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt  including our swaps  mortgages  the notes  the convertible notes  and certain seller financed promissory notes  but  with respect to such fixed rate debt instruments  do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk and germany 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to our intent to remain 
table of contents permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million change to our revenues for the year ended december  in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
