table of contents our industry according to gartner  inc  an independent it market research firm  enterprise security infrastructure is forecasted to be a billion market in gartner estimates that the intrusion prevention market  our core business  was approximately billion in and is projected to grow to billion in in  we launched new solutions into two adjacent markets next generation firewalls and advanced malware protection 
according to gartner data  this is expected to increase our addressable market from approximately billion to more than billion over the next years 
we expect that demand for security solutions will continue to rise as organizations seek to address various growing and evolving security challenges  including increasing change of it environments 
the nature of computing is changing 
today s environments are experiencing a proliferation of devices  users  and web applications all connecting over an ever changing network of physical devices  virtualized data centers  and clouds 
this results in new attack vectors available to hackers to access identity data  trade and classified secrets  intellectual property  and critical infrastructure 
trends of consumerization bring your own device to work  mobilization  and virtualization are driving these changes and the rate of change is increasing 
greater sophistication  severity and frequency of attacks 
in contrast to the hobbyist hackers of the past  today s attackers are motivated by financial gain 
these motivated attackers are employing much more sophisticated tools and techniques to generate profits for themselves and their well organized and well financed sponsors  including organized crime and nation states 
their attacks are increasingly difficult to detect and their tools often establish command and control points on compromised network assets with little or no discernible effect  facilitating future access to the assets  the data  and the networks on which they reside 
diverse demands on security administrators 
targeted security solutions such as firewalls  intrusion prevention systems  url filters  spam filters and advanced malware protection are critical layers to enhancing security 
however  they can create significant administrative burdens on personnel who must manage numerous disparate technologies that are seldom integrated and often difficult to use 
most security products require manual  labor intensive incident response and investigation by security administrators  especially when false positive results are generated 
compounding these resource constraint issues  many organizations are increasingly challenged by the loss of key personnel as the demand for security experts has risen dramatically in traditional corporate settings  government agencies and a growing number of start up security companies 
heightened government and industry regulation 
rapidly increasing government regulation mandates compliance with increased security requirements  escalating demand for solutions that both meet compliance requirements and reduce the burden of compliance reporting and enforcement 
these regulations include the payment card industry data security standard  or pci dss  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of for risk management and the federal information security management act  or fisma  which is designed to protect national defense initiatives 
our vision due to the growing and evolving nature of security challenges  sourcefire believes that the approach to security must also evolve 
the best solutions must be agile  based on a continuous process and supported by advanced technologies to better detect  analyze and prevent relentless and sophisticated attacks 
sourcefire calls this vision agile security 
sourcefire s agile security vision drives the engineering of our technology and solutions 
this vision reflects the realities of today s network and computer security disciplines and is grounded in four essential elements see clarity and vision  reflecting the who  what  where reality of your environment  as it exists right now

backlog while it is our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we generally have product license orders that have not shipped as of the end of a particular period 
in the ordinary course of our business  such orders are generally shipped within days 
although the amount of such product license orders varies  we do not believe the amount of such orders  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of our future performance 
manufacturing and suppliers we typically hold limited inventory 
we utilize two principal contract equipment manufacturers to source components  assemble  integrate and test our appliances and to ship those appliances to our customers 
the two principle contract manufacturers give us manufacturing presence in north america  latin america  europe and asia 
in addition  we utilize a third contract manufacturer to design and integrate some of our software and hardware components for use in the high performance models of our appliances 
our agreements with these

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
while we cannot determine the extent to which piracy of our software products occurs  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
for a discussion of seasonality affecting our business  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations seasonality 
competition the market for cybersecurity solutions is intensely competitive and we expect strong competition to continue in the future 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  stronger relationships with strategic channel partners  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources and other market advantages 
increasingly  commoditized security protection is offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
potential customers may perceive our products as less valuable or even unnecessary if similar functionality is available at a significant discount or free 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may have greater resources to devote to the promotion and sale of their products 
our principal competitors are set forth below network security 
in the market for network security  including intrusion prevention and next generation firewall  our chief competitors generally fall within the following categories large companies  including cisco systems  inc  ibm corporation  hp corporation  check point software technologies  ltd 
and intel corporation as a result of its acquisition of mcafee  inc  that sell competitive products and offerings  software or hardware network infrastructure companies that could integrate features that are similar to our products into their own products  smaller software companies offering applications for network and internet security monitoring  detection  prevention or response  and 
table of contents small and large companies offering point solutions that compete with components of our product offerings 
advanced malware and endpoint protection 
sourcefire has entered the endpoint protection market with an emphasis on the emerging advanced malware protection market 
sourcefire s solutions complement existing endpoint and network security products to protect from threats that may bypass these existing defenses 
in the enterprise and consumer anti malware markets  our chief competitors are large established endpoint protection market players and new entrants in an emerging advanced malware protection market 
new market entrants consist primarily of early stage venture backed point product companies with a singular focus and aggressive sales and marketing efforts 
several companies currently sell security software products that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted 
some of these companies sell products that perform the same functions as some of our products 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include functions similar to those that our products currently provide 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for information security solutions include security effectiveness  manageability  technical features  performance  ease of use  price  scope of product offerings  professional services capabilities  distribution relationships and customer service and support 
we believe that our solutions generally compete favorably with respect to such factors 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in product research and development and were engaged in sales and marketing

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks relating to our business  operations and industry adverse economic  market and political conditions may negatively affect our revenue and results of operations 
our business depends significantly on a range of factors that are beyond our control 
these include general economic and business conditions  the overall demand for network security products and services and other security products and services  and constraints on budgets and changes in spending priorities of corporations and government agencies 
the us and global economies have experienced a period of prolonged economic weakness  including a reduction in business confidence and activity  reduced capital spending  a lack of availability of credit  high unemployment and disruptions in financial markets 
these and other factors have affected  and in the future may affect  one or more of the industries or geographies to which we sell our products and services 
our customers include  but are not limited to  financial institutions  defense contractors  health care providers  information technology companies  telecommunications companies and retailers 
these customers may suffer from reduced operating budgets  which could cause them to defer or forego purchases of our products or services 
in addition  negative effects on the financial condition of our resellers and distributors could affect their ability or willingness to market our product and service offerings  negative effects on the financial condition of our product manufacturers could affect their ability to manufacture our products  and declines in economic and market conditions could impair our short term investment portfolio 
any of these developments could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
federal and state governmental agencies have contributed to our revenue growth and have become important customers for us 
if we cannot attract sufficient government agency customers  our revenue and competitive position will suffer 
reduced spending levels by us government agencies have had a negative effect on our revenue and results of operations and may continue to have a negative effect in the future 
federal and state governments have become important customers for us 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from these customers 
contracts with the us federal and state government agencies collectively accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our reliance on government customers subjects us to a number of risks  including budgetary constraints and cycles 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability 
reductions or delays in funding  including delays caused by the failure to pass a budget  continuing resolutions or other temporary funding arrangements  could adversely impact public sector demand for our products 
as of the date of this annual report  the us federal government has not adopted a budget for its fiscal year ending september  and is operating under a continuing budget resolution  which has resulted in reduced spending levels by us government agencies 
we believe that reduced federal spending levels and the uncertainty related to the federal budget process negatively affected our sales to the federal government for the year ended december   and may negatively affect our results of operations in the future

contracting with public sector customers is highly competitive and can be expensive and time consuming  often requiring that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract  modification or cancellation of contracts 
public sector customers often have contractual or other legal rights to terminate current contracts for convenience or due to a default 
if a contract is cancelled for convenience  which can occur if the customer s product needs change  we may only be able to collect for products and services delivered prior to termination 
if a contract is cancelled because of our default  we may only be able to collect for products and alternative products and services delivered to the customer  governmental audits 
national governments and state and local agencies routinely investigate and audit government contractors administrative processes 
they may audit our performance and pricing and review our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
if they find that we improperly allocated costs  they may require us to refund those costs or may refuse to pay us for outstanding balances related to the improper allocation 
an unfavorable audit could result in a reduction of revenue  and may result in civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  and replacing existing products 
many government agencies already have installed network security products of our competitors 
it can be very difficult to convince government agencies or other prospective customers to replace their existing network security solutions with our products  even if we can demonstrate the superiority of our products 
we face intense competition in our markets  especially from larger  better known companies  and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we may not compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
our chief competitors currently include large software companies  software or hardware network infrastructure companies  smaller software companies offering applications for network and internet security monitoring  detection  prevention or response  and small and large companies offering point solutions that compete with components of our product offerings 
for example  cisco systems  inc  ibm corporation  hp corporation  intel corporation  as a result of its acquisition of mcafee  inc  and check point software technologies  ltd 
have intrusion detection or prevention technologies that compete with our network security product offerings 
similarly  several large and small companies have anti malware and endpoint protection products that compete with our fireamp product 
in addition  our next generation firewall product competes with both new and traditional firewall vendors 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product portfolios  or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they also have greater resources to devote to the promotion and sale of their products than we have 
in addition  in some cases our competitors have aggressively reduced  and could continue to reduce  the price of their security monitoring  detection  prevention and response products  managed security services  maintenance and support services  and other security services and products which intensifies pricing pressures within our market 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include functions similar to those that our products provide 
the widespread inclusion of features comparable to our software in operating system software or networking hardware could render our products less competitive or obsolete  particularly if such features are of a high quality 
even if security functions integrated into operating system software or networking hardware are more limited than those of our products  a significant number of customers may accept more limited functionality to avoid purchasing additional products such as ours 

table of contents one of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone can offer new software products for free under an open source licensing model in order to gain rapid and widespread market acceptance 
such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional technology companies 
it is possible for new competitors with greater resources than ours to develop their own open source security solutions  potentially reducing the demand for our solutions 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
competitive pressure and or the availability of open source software may result in price reductions  reduced revenue  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
new competitors could emerge and could impair our sales 
new sources of competition for sales of our products could emerge 
these include emerging companies as well as larger companies who have not previously entered the market for network security products  anti malware and endpoint protection products  or next generation firewall products  established companies that develop their own network intrusion detection and prevention products  anti malware and endpoint protection products  or next generation firewall products  established companies that acquire or establish product integration  distribution or other cooperative relationships with our current competitors  and new competitors or alliances among competitors that emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share due to factors such as greater brand name recognition  a larger installed customer base and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and experience 
our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable  in part because of the purchasing and budget practices of our customers  which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline 
our operating results have historically varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors  most of which are outside of our control  including the budgeting cycles  internal approval requirements and funding available to our existing and prospective customers for the purchase of network security products  reductions or delays in funding for projects by us federal and state government agencies  for example the reductions and delays in spending that have resulted  and may continue to result  from the failure of the us federal government to adopt a budget for its fiscal year ending september   the timing  size and contract terms of orders received  which have historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters  but may fluctuate seasonally in different ways  the effect of one or more large orders on our operating results for a particular quarter and the effect of such large order or orders on comparisons of operating results for subsequent quarters  the level of perceived threats to network security  which may fluctuate from period to period  the level of demand for products sold by resellers  distributors  mssps  government integrators and other partners  the market acceptance of open source software solutions  the announcement or introduction of new product offerings by us or our competitors  and the levels of anticipation and market acceptance of those products  price competition  
table of contents general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets  the product mix of our sales  and the timing of revenue recognition for our sales 
in particular  the network security technology procurement practices of many of our customers have had a measurable influence on the historical variability of our operating performance 
our prospective customers usually exercise great care and invest substantial time in their network security technology purchasing decisions 
as a result  our sales cycles are long  generally between six and twelve months or sometimes longer  which further impacts the variability of our results 
additionally  many of our customers have historically finalized purchase decisions in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
a delay in even one large order beyond the end of a particular quarter can substantially diminish our anticipated revenue for that quarter 
in addition  many of our expenses must be incurred before we generate revenue 
as a result  the negative impact on our operating results would increase if our revenue fails to meet expectations in any period 
the cumulative effect of these factors may result in larger fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly operating results than in the operating results of many other software and technology companies 
this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet the revenue or operating results expectations of securities industry analysts or investors for a particular period 
if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons  the market price of our shares could fall substantially  and we could face costly securities class action suits as a result 
therefore  you should not rely on our operating results in any quarter as being indicative of our operating results for any future period  nor should you rely on other expectations  predictions or projections of our future revenue or other aspects of our results of operations 
we achieved profitability on an annual basis for the first time in  which we may not be able to maintain 
we incurred operating losses each year from our inception in through we achieved profitability on an annual basis for the first time in maintaining profitability will depend in large part on our ability to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods 
although our revenue has generally been increasing  there can be no assurances that we will maintain or increase our level of profitability 
our operating expenses may continue to increase as we seek to expand our customer base  increase our sales and marketing efforts and continue to invest in research and development of our technologies and products 
these efforts may be more costly than we expect and we may not be able to increase our revenue to offset our operating expenses 
if we cannot increase our revenue at a greater rate than our expenses  we will not remain profitable 
if we do not continue to establish and effectively manage our indirect distribution channels  or if our resellers  distributors and other partners fail to perform as expected  our revenue could suffer 
as part of our growth strategy  we have expanded  and intend to continue to expand  our indirect distribution channel 
our ability to sell our network security software and other products in new markets and to increase our share of existing markets will be impaired if we fail to manage or expand our indirect distribution channels 
our sales strategy involves the establishment of multiple distribution channels domestically and internationally through strategic resellers  distributors  mssps  government integrators and other partners 
as of december   we had agreements with third parties for the distribution of our products  compared to as of december  we cannot predict the extent to which these companies will be successful in marketing or selling our products 
there is a risk that our pace of entering into such agreements may slow 
in addition  our agreements with these companies could be terminated on short notice  and the agreements do not prevent these companies from selling the network security software of other companies  including our competitors 
any distributor of our products could give higher priority to other companies products or to their own products than they give to ours  which could cause our revenue to decline 
there is also a risk that some or all of our resellers  distributors and other partners may be acquired  change their business models or go out of business  any of which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents we are subject to risks of operating internationally that could impair our ability to grow our revenue abroad 
we market and sell our products in the united states and internationally  and we plan to increase our international sales presence 
therefore  we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations 
sales to customers located outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expansion of our existing operations and entry into additional worldwide markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we are also subject to a number of risks customary for international operations  including economic or political instability in foreign markets  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  import and export controls  the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  compliance with tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  the failure to realize expected tax benefits associated with our international operations  changes in regulatory or tax requirements  costs of compliance and penalties for noncompliance with foreign laws and laws applicable to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions  costs of compliance and penalties for noncompliance with laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection  privacy and encryption  management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  a substantial portion of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies 
to date  we have not used risk management techniques or hedged the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result  our results of operations are subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the market for network security products is rapidly evolving  and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop 
if we do not accurately predict  prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing customer needs  our competitive position and prospects could be harmed 
the market for network security products is expected to continue to evolve rapidly 
moreover  many customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans  which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks  incorporating a variety of hardware  software applications  operating systems and networking protocols 
in addition  computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks 
customers look to our products to continue to protect their networks against these threats in this increasingly complex environment without sacrificing network efficiency or causing significant network downtime 
the software in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack  without impeding the high network performance demanded by our customers 
although the market expects speedy introduction of software to respond to new threats  the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release of new products is uncertain 
therefore  in the future we may experience delays in the introduction of new products 
table of contents or new versions  modifications or enhancements of existing products 
if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our customers by developing and introducing on a timely basis new and effective products  upgrades and services that can respond adequately to new security threats  our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 
if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  our results of operations and competitive position could suffer 
we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhance versions of our open source and proprietary commercial products 
in  we developed and introduced new products in two adjacent markets  sourcefire next generation firewall in the next generation firewall market and sourcefire fireamp in the advanced malware and endpoint protection market 
in addition  we introduced new versions of our next generation intrusion prevention system products 
we introduce new products and incorporate additional features  improve functionality or add other enhancements to our existing products in order to meet our customers rapidly evolving demands for security in our highly competitive industry 
when we develop a new product or an advanced version of an existing product  we typically expend significant money and effort upfront to market  promote and sell the new offering 
therefore  when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products  they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing the products to market 
our new products or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons  including delays in introducing new  enhanced or modified products  defects  errors or failures in any of our products  inability to operate effectively with the networks of our prospective customers  inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers  negative publicity about the performance or effectiveness of our network security products  reluctance of customers to purchase products based on open source software  and disruptions or delays in the availability and delivery of our products  including products from our contract manufacturers 
if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market  our competitive position could be impaired  our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research  development  marketing  sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product 
if existing customers do not make subsequent purchases from us or renew their support arrangements with us  or if our relationships with our largest customers are impaired  our revenue could decline 
for the years ended december   and  existing customers that purchased additional products and services from us  whether for new locations or additional technology to protect existing networks and locations  generated a majority of our total revenue 
part of our growth strategy is to sell additional products to our existing customers 
we may not be effective in executing this or any other aspect of our growth strategy 
our revenue could decline if our current customers do not continue to purchase additional products from us 
in addition  as we deploy new versions of our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may not require the functionality of these products and may not purchase them 
we also depend on our installed customer base for future service revenue from annual maintenance fees 
our maintenance and support agreements typically have durations of one year 
if customers choose not to continue their maintenance service or seek to renegotiate the terms of maintenance and support agreements prior to renewing such agreements  our revenue may decline 

table of contents defects  errors or vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and business and divert our resources 
because our products are complex  they may contain defects  errors or vulnerabilities that are not detected until after our commercial release and installation by our customers 
we may not be able to correct any errors or defects or address vulnerabilities promptly  or at all 
any defects  errors or vulnerabilities in our products could result in expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze  correct and eliminate defects  to address and eliminate vulnerabilities or to create alternative solutions  loss of existing or potential customers  delayed or lost revenue  failure to timely attain or maintain market acceptance  increased service  warranty  product replacement and product liability insurance costs  and negative publicity  which could harm our reputation 
in addition  because our products and services provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty 
anyone who circumvents our customers security measures using our products could misappropriate the confidential information or other valuable property of  or interrupt the operations of our customers 
if that happens  affected customers or others could sue us 
in addition  we may face liability for breaches of our product warranties or product failures 
provisions in our contracts relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations may be deemed by a court to be unenforceable 
some courts  for example  have found contractual limitations of liability in standard computer and software contracts to be unenforceable in some circumstances 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and divert management attention from the operation of our business 
our business liability insurance coverage may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all 
our networks  products and services may be subject to intentional disruption 
as a leading network security solutions company  we are a high profile target for cyberattacks 
we expect our networks  products and services to be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation 
experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our networks  information systems and websites and impede the performance of our products  cause interruptions of our services or misappropriate information 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation  and to respond to such situations  we expect efforts to intentionally disrupt our networks  products and services to continue 
if these efforts are successful  our operations could be disrupted  our business could be significantly affected as a result of harm to our reputation  and we could suffer monetary and other losses 
we have acquired  and in the future may acquire  additional businesses  products or technologies as part of our long term growth strategy  and such acquisitions may not ultimately be successful or may not result in expected strategic benefits 
in december  we acquired immunet corporation 
we may seek to buy or make investments in additional complementary or competitive businesses  products or technologies as part of our long term growth strategy 
we may not be successful in making these additional acquisitions 
we may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other companies  including larger companies with greater financial resources 
we may incur substantial expenses in identifying and negotiating acquisition opportunities  whether or not completed 
acquisitions may not result in the expected strategic benefits  and completed acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of immunet corporation  could negatively affect our operating results and financial position because of the following and other factors the immunet acquisition was dilutive to our earnings per share for the year ended december  and any acquisitions we complete in the future may also be dilutive to our earnings  
table of contents in connection with our acquisition of immunet corporation  for the year ended december  we recognized  and we expect to continue to recognize  expenses for the amortization of intangible assets  employee retention payments and stock based compensation expense and other acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses  write offs of in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  we may not effectively integrate an acquired business  product or technology into our existing business and operations  completing a potential acquisition and integrating an acquired business into our existing business could significantly divert management s time and resources from the operation of our business  acquired companies  particularly privately held and non us companies  may have internal controls  policies and procedures that do not meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and public company accounting standards  we may use a significant portion of our cash resources to fund acquisitions  and we may issue stock to fund acquisitions  which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders 
in the future  we may not be able to secure financing necessary to make acquisitions or to operate and grow our business as planned 
in the future  we may need to raise additional funds to make acquisitions or to expand our sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities or to fund the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development efforts  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if we issue debt  the debt holders could have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations  including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
furthermore  if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders would experience dilution  and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock 
if other parties claim commercial ownership rights to snort  razorback or clamav  our reputation  customer relations and results of operations could be harmed 
while we created a majority of the current snort code base  razorback code base and clamav code base  a portion of the current code for each of snort  razorback and clamav was created  or in the future may be created  by the combined efforts of sourcefire and the open source software community  and a portion was created  or in the future may be created  solely by the open source community 
we believe that the portions of the snort code base  razorback code base and clamav code base created by anyone other than us are required to be licensed by us pursuant to the gnu general public license  or gpl  which is how we currently license snort and clamav 
there is a risk  however  that a third party could claim some ownership rights in snort  razorback or clamav  attempt to prevent us from commercially licensing snort  razorback or clamav in the future rather than pursuant to the gpl as currently licensed or claim a right to licensing royalties 
any such claim  regardless of its merit or outcome  could be costly to defend  harm our reputation and customer relations or result in our having to pay substantial compensation to the party claiming ownership 
we rely on software licensed from other parties  the loss of which could increase our costs and delay delivery of our products 
we utilize various types of software licensed from unaffiliated third parties 
for example  we license mysql database software that we use in our products 
our agreement with oracle corporation permits us to distribute mysql software on our products to our customers worldwide until june  our agreement with oracle gives us the unlimited right to distribute mysql software in exchange for a one time lump sum payment 
we believe that the mysql agreement is material to our business because we have spent a significant amount of 
table of contents development resources to allow the mysql software to function in our products 
if we were forced to find replacement database software or replacements for any of the other software we license from others for our products  our business would be disrupted and we could be required to expend significant resources  and there would be no guarantee that we would be able to procure the replacement on the same or similar commercial terms and conditions  or at all 
additionally  we would be required to either redesign our products to function with software available from other parties or develop these components ourselves  which could result in increased costs and could result in delays in our product shipments and the release of new product offerings 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future products 
if we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these software licenses  we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the software 
our inability to hire or retain key personnel  or to effectively manage headcount increases  could impair our intended growth 
our business is dependent on our ability to hire  retain  motivate and manage highly qualified personnel  including senior management and sales and technical professionals 
in particular  as part of our growth strategy  we have expanded  and intend to continue to expand the size of our sales force domestically and internationally and have hired  and expect to continue to hire  additional engineering  customer support and professional services personnel 
however  competition for qualified engineering and services personnel is intense  and if we are unable to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified sales  engineering and services personnel that our business needs  our reputation  customer satisfaction and potential revenue growth could be seriously harmed 
to the extent that we hire personnel from competitors  we may also be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 
our intended future growth may also place a significant strain on our management  financial  personnel and other resources 
in addition  our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our executive officers and senior personnel 
although we have adopted retention plans applicable to certain of these officers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain their services 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect our business and could divert other senior management time in searching for their replacements 
our business is subject to corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to the rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities  such as the public company accounting oversight board  the sec  and the nasdaq stock exchange  that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended december  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our business and reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations  either of which could materially increase our operating expenses 
because new and modified laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by 
table of contents regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
any material disruption or problem with the operation of our information systems may adversely impact our business  operating processes and internal controls 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful operation of our information systems 
in particular  we rely on our information systems to process financial information  manage inventory and administer our sales transactions 
in recent years  we have experienced considerable growth in transaction volume and headcount  and we are increasingly relying upon international resources in our operations 
our information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the continued growth of our operations and the efficient management of our business 
in an effort to improve the efficiency of our operations  achieve greater automation and support the growth of our business  we have implemented an enterprise resource planning  or erp  system and a customer resource management  or crm  system 
these information systems may not work as we currently intend 
any material disruption or similar problems with the operation of our information systems could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if our information system resources are inadequate  we may be required to undertake costly modifications and the growth of our business could be harmed 
potential uncertainty resulting from unsolicited acquisition proposals and related matters may adversely affect our business 
in the past we have received  and in the future we may receive  unsolicited proposals to acquire our company or our assets 
the review and consideration of acquisition proposals and related matters could require the expenditure of significant management time and personnel resources 
such proposals may also create uncertainty for our employees  customers and business partners 
any such uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to retain key employees and hire new talent  and could cause our customers and business partners to not enter into new arrangements with us or to terminate existing arrangements 
additionally  we and members of our board of directors could be subject to future lawsuits related to unsolicited proposals to acquire us 
any such future lawsuits could become time consuming and expensive 
these matters  alone or in combination  may harm our business 
risks relating to our intellectual property and litigation our products contain open source software  and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 
like many other technology companies  we use and distribute open source software in order to expedite development of new products and features 
open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses  including  for example  the gnu general public license  or gpl  the gnu lesser public license  or lgpl  the bsd license and the apache license 
this open source software includes  without limitation  snort  clamav  linux kernel  apache http server  openssl and perl 
these license terms may be ambiguous  in many instances have not been interpreted by the courts and could be interpreted in a manner that results in unanticipated obligations regarding our products 
depending upon how the open source software is deployed by our developers and the underlying licenses are interpreted by the courts  we could be required to offer our products that use the open source software for no cost  make available the source code for modifications or derivative works  or secure an additional license to the underlying patent rights 
any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software 
our use of open source software could also result in us developing and selling products that infringe third party intellectual property rights 
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the code incorporates proprietary software or otherwise infringes another party s 
table of contents intellectual property rights including patent rights 
we have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software 
however  we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
we also have processes and controls in place to review the use of open source software in the products developed by companies that we may acquire 
even if we conduct due diligence prior to completing an acquisition  the acquired products or technologies may nonetheless include open source software that was not identified during the initial due diligence 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies of any companies we may acquire that incorporate open source software or to otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition may be restricted in the same manner as if the open source software had been incorporated into our own products 
our intellectual property rights may be difficult to enforce  which could enable others to compete with us or to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology 
however  the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights and technology may not deter its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products 
our products incorporate open source snort software  which is readily available to the public 
to the extent that our proprietary software is included by others in what are purported to be open source products  it may be difficult and expensive to enforce our intellectual property rights in such software 
competitors also may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our proprietary technology 
in addition  from time to time  we become aware that users of our security products may not have paid adequate license  technical support  or subscription fees to us 
however  some jurisdictions may not provide an adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
furthermore  changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our software or lessened sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to refraining from intellectual property piracy or other infringements of intellectual property could also harm our business 
in limited instances we have agreed to place  and in the future may agree to place  source code for our proprietary software in escrow 
in most cases  the escrowed source code may be made available to certain of our customers and partners in the event that we were to file for bankruptcy or materially fail to support our products in the future 
release of our source code upon any such event would increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our software 
we have rarely agreed to source code escrow arrangements in the past and usually only in connection with prospective customers considering a significant purchase of our products and services 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights in our technologies  we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense  time and effort required to create competitive technologies 
as a result  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
efforts to assert intellectual property ownership rights in our products could impact our standing in the open source community  which could limit our product innovation capabilities 
if we were to undertake actions to protect and maintain ownership and control over our intellectual property rights  our standing in the open source community could be diminished 
this could in turn limit our ability to rely on this community as a resource to identify and defend against new viruses  threats and techniques to attack secure networks  explore new ideas and concepts and further our research and development efforts 

table of contents claims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others could harm our business and cause us to incur significant costs 
the security technology industry has increasingly been subject to patent and other intellectual property rights litigation  particularly from special purpose entities that seek to monetize their intellectual property rights by asserting claims against others 
we expect this trend to continue and accelerate and expect that we may from time to time be required to defend against this type of litigation 
for example  as described under legal proceedings below  we and nine other network security companies have been named as defendants in a patent infringement lawsuit 
third party asserted claims or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our customers  end users  manufacturers  suppliers  partners or distributors  alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products 
the litigation process can be costly and is subject to inherent uncertainties  so we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position 
in addition to the expense and distraction associated with litigation  adverse determinations could cause us to lose our proprietary rights  prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  require us to obtain licenses to patents or other intellectual property rights that our products are alleged to infringe  which licenses may not be available on reasonable commercial terms or at all  and subject us to significant liabilities 
under the terms of our contracts  we may also be required to indemnify customers and others for losses or costs arising from such claims and such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
if we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology 
similarly  we face exposure to infringement actions if we hire software engineers who were previously employed by competitors and those employees inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of our competitors into our products despite efforts by our competitors and us to prevent such infringement 
future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
from time to time we have been  and may be in the future  subject to litigation  including stockholder derivative actions 
risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify  and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
while we maintain director and officer insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim  and there can be no assurance as to the continued availability of this insurance 
we may in the future be the target of additional proceedings  with or without merit  and these proceedings may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
risks relating to manufacturing we depend on a limited number of manufacturers of our hardware products  which increases our vulnerability to supply disruption 
our ability to meet our customers demand for our products depends upon obtaining adequate hardware platforms on a timely basis and integrating them with our software 
we utilize two principal contract equipment manufacturers  patriot technologies  inc and premio  inc  to source components  assemble  integrate and test our appliances and to ship those appliances to our customers 
in addition  we utilize a third contract manufacturer  netronome systems inc  to design and integrate some of our software and hardware components for use in the high performance models of our appliances 
the unexpected termination of our relationship with any of these manufacturers would be disruptive to our business and our reputation  and could result in a material decline in our revenue as well as shipment delays and possible increased costs as we seek and implement production with an alternative manufacturer 

table of contents in addition  we rely on our contract manufacturers to source the components for our hardware platforms and they in turn obtain materials from a limited number of suppliers 
these suppliers may extend lead times  limit the supply to our manufacturers or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to avoid shortages  we may encounter these problems in the future 
our results of operations would be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of hardware platforms in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of hardware platforms or problems with the quality of those hardware platforms 
we commit in advance to purchase products from contract manufacturers based on our expectations of future demand and a portion of these commitments are non cancelable 
in addition  in some cases we purchase products from contract manufacturers and hold them in inventory based on our expectations of future demand 
if demand for our products does not meet our expectations  or if products become obsolete as a result of our introduction of new products  we could be required to recognize an expense related to our purchase commitments or write down the value of our inventory  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we commit in advance to purchase products from our contract manufacturers based on our expectations of future demand and a portion of these commitments are non cancelable 
in addition  in some cases we purchase products from contract manufacturers based on our expectations of future demand 
demand for our products may not meet our expectations as a result of a number of factors  including weakness in general economic conditions  reductions in our customers purchasing budgets  discounting of prices on competitive products  defects or perceived defects in the products or the introduction by us or our competitors of new or enhanced products 
in the past  we have recognized expenses related to purchase commitments and inventory write offs and  in the future  if we reduce our estimate of future demand for products that we are committed to purchase or hold in inventory  or if such products become obsolete as a result of our introduction of new products  we may be required to recognize additional expenses for purchase commitments or inventory write offs  which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations 
risks relating to our common stock the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations 
since the time of our initial public offering in march  the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future 
for example  during the year ended december   our stock traded between a high of per share and a low of per share 
among the factors that could affect our common stock price are the risks described in this risk factors section and other factors  including quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or reports by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of similar companies or of our competitors  liquidity and activity in the market for our common stock  actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders  strategic moves by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
stock markets in general  and the stocks of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 

table of contents sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets  or the perception that they might occur  could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain 
as of february   we had  outstanding shares of common stock 
this number includes shares held by institutional investors who own a significant majority of our common stock 
this number also includes shares held by directors and officers who may sell such shares at their discretion  subject to volume limitations contained in federal securities laws 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan could make an acquisition of our company  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and our ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan under which we would issue preferred stock rights upon specified events  which could substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  delaware corporate law and our stockholder rights plan collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with us  they would apply even if stockholders consider the offer to be beneficial 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management

item legal proceedings on may  and august   enhanced security research  llc  or esr  filed two nearly identical complaints in the united states district court for the district of delaware against defendants  including cisco systems  inc  international business machines corporation  check point software technologies  ltd  check point software technologies  inc  sonicwall  inc  com corporation  nokia corporation  nokia  inc  fortinet  inc  and us 
the only significant difference between the first and second complaints is the addition of security research holdings llc as a plaintiff 
the complaints allege  among other things  that our network security appliances and software infringe two us patents 
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages  enhancement of those damages  an attorney s fee award and an injunction against further infringement 
we believe that the patents in this case are invalid and that the allegations of infringement are without merit  and we intend to defend this case vigorously on these bases 
both patents in this litigation are currently undergoing reexamination by the 
table of contents united states patent and trademark office  or uspto  and the uspto has rejected all claims of both patents as not patentable 
in both reexaminations  the patent owner has filed appeals to the us patent office board of appeals and interferences arguing that the claims are patentable 
in both cases  the patent owner has requested an oral hearing 
on june   the district court dismissed the action filed may   for lack of standing 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the dismissal following plaintiff s appeal 
also on june   the district court stayed the action filed august  pending conclusion of the reexaminations 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and jury trials  we cannot at this early stage of the matter estimate the possible outcome of this litigation 
because patent litigation is time consuming and costly to defend  we may incur significant costs related to this matter in future periods 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in this matter could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or cash flows

repurchases of equity securities during repurchases are made under the terms of our stock incentive plan 
under this plan  we may award shares of restricted stock to our employees and directors 
these shares of restricted stock typically are subject to a lapsing right of repurchase by us 
we may exercise this right of repurchase in the event that a restricted stock recipient s service to us is terminated 
if we exercise this right  we are required to repay the purchase price paid by or on behalf of the recipient for the repurchased restricted shares  which typically is the par value per share of 
repurchased shares are returned to the stock incentive plan and are available for future awards under the terms of that plan 
these were the no repurchases of equity securities made by us during the fiscal quarter ended december  we do not have a stock repurchase program

table of contents sales to us federal and state government agencies collectively accounted for  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our revenues from us federal and state government agencies increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
we believe that our revenue from product sales for the year ended december  was positively affected by the introduction of new  enhanced versions of our products and by the expansion of our indirect sales channel 
in addition  our revenue from sales of services during was positively affected by an increase in our installed customer base 
we expect these factors to continue to positively affect our product and services revenue in we also believe that reduced federal spending levels and the uncertainty related to the federal budget process negatively affected our revenue from product sales to the federal government for the year ended december   and may negatively affect our revenue from product sales to the federal government in we evaluate our performance on the basis of several key financial metrics  including revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit  and operating expenses 
we compare these key performance indicators  on a quarterly basis  to both target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we also evaluate performance on the basis of adjusted income from operations  adjusted income from operations as a percentage of revenue  adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share and free cash flow  which are non gaap financial measures 
information regarding our non gaap financial measures and a reconciliation of each to the nearest gaap measure is provided under non gaap financial measures below 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales and services 
product revenue is principally derived from the sale of our network security solutions 
our network security solutions include a perpetual software license bundled with a third party hardware platform 
services revenue is principally derived from technical support and professional services 
we typically sell technical support to complement our network security product solutions 
technical support entitles a customer to product updates and new rule releases on a when and if available basis and both telephone and web based assistance for using our products 
our professional services revenue includes optional installation  configuration and tuning  which we refer to collectively as network security deployment services 
these services typically occur on site after delivery has occurred 
product sales are typically recognized as revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer 
for sales through resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers and distributors provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
we recognize revenue from services when the services are performed 
for technical support services  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the support arrangement  which is generally months 
our support agreements generally provide for payment in advance 
we sell our network security solutions globally 
however   and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  was generated by sales to us based customers 
we expect that our revenue from customers based outside of the united states will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we strengthen our international presence 
we continue to generate a majority of our product revenue through sales to existing customers  both for new locations and for additional technology to protect existing networks and locations 
product sales to existing customers accounted for  and of total product revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect product sales to existing customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our product revenue in historically  our product revenue has been seasonal  with a significant portion of our total product revenue in recent fiscal years generated in the third and fourth quarters 
revenue from our government customers has 
table of contents been influenced by the september th fiscal year end of the us federal government  which has historically resulted in our revenue from government customers being highest in the second half of the year 
while we expect these historical trends to continue  they could be affected by a number of factors  including another decline in general economic conditions  changes in the timing or amounts of us government spending and our planned international expansion 
notwithstanding these general seasonal patterns  our revenue within a particular quarter is often affected significantly by the unpredictable procurement patterns of our customers 
our prospective customers usually spend a long time evaluating and making purchase decisions for network security solutions 
historically  many of our customers have not finalized their purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter 
we expect these purchasing patterns to continue in the future 
therefore  a delay in even one large order beyond the end of the quarter could materially reduce our anticipated revenue for a quarter 
in addition  because we typically recognize revenue upon shipment  the timing of our quarter end and year end shipments could materially affect our reported product revenue for a given quarter or year 
delayed orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and could therefore cause us to fail to meet the financial performance expectations of financial and industry research analysts or investors 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of the hardware platform  third party manufacturing costs  royalties for third party software  personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control  stock based compensation expense  amortization of acquired intangible assets  supplies  warranty  shipping and handling costs  expense for inventory excess and obsolescence and depreciation in the instances where we lease our network security solutions to our customers 
we allocate overhead costs  including facilities  supplies  communication and information systems and employee benefits  to the cost of product revenue 
overhead costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
as our product volume increases  we anticipate incurring an increased amount of both direct and overhead expenses to supply and manage the increased volume 
in addition  hardware unit costs or other costs of manufacturing could increase in the future 
for the year ended december   write downs for excess and obsolete inventory increased million compared to the prior year as a result of new product introductions 
in addition  in second half of  we recognized million of expense in product cost of revenue for purchase commitments we have made to our contract manufacturers for the product and component inventory that has been estimated to be in excess of future demand for existing products due to the introduction of our new products 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future demand for our products could change in the near term and result in additional inventory valuation adjustments or commitment reserves which would negatively impact our future results of operations 
cost of services revenue includes the direct labor costs of our employees and outside consultants engaged to furnish those services  as well as their travel and associated direct material costs and stock based compensation expense 
additionally  we include in cost of services revenue an allocation of overhead costs  as well as the cost of time and materials to service or repair the hardware component of our products covered under a renewed support arrangement beyond the manufacturer s warranty  the amortization of a long term contract for a third party to provide maintenance and support services for certain product offerings and the expense for advance replacement unit inventory excess and obsolescence 
as our customer base continues to grow  we anticipate incurring an increasing amount of these service and repair costs  as well as costs for additional personnel to provide support and service to our customers 
gross profit our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of our products  our pricing policy  new product introductions  the cost of hardware platforms  expense for inventory excess and obsolescence  warranty expense  the cost of labor and materials and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
our gross profit would be adversely affected by price declines or pricing discounts if we are unable to reduce costs on existing products and fail to introduce new products with higher margins 
currently  product sales typically have a lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue than our services due to the cost of the hardware platform 
our gross profit for any particular quarter could be adversely 
table of contents affected if we do not complete a sufficient level of sales of higher margin products by the end of the quarter 
as discussed above  many of our customers do not finalize purchasing decisions until the final weeks or days of a quarter  so a delay in even one large order of a high margin product could significantly reduce our total gross profit percentage for that quarter 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for our engineers  stock based compensation expense  retention obligations related to our hiring of former immunet employees  costs for professional services to design  test and certify our products  and costs associated with data used by us in our product development 
we have expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing commercial and federal government markets as well as new markets for security solutions 
to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
accordingly  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december  and  as a percentage of revenue  will be consistent with sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation expense  trade show  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  marketing consultants and other professional services  training  seminars and conferences  and travel and related costs 
as we continue to focus on increasing our market penetration  expanding internationally  increasing our indirect sales channel and building brand awareness  we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december  and  as a percentage of revenue  will be consistent with general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation and allocated overhead costs for executive  legal  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expense  corporate development expenses and professional fees related to legal  audit  tax and regulatory compliance  travel and related costs  and corporate insurance 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the year ending december  stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and employee stock purchases 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility 
based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock based awards  we recognized aggregate stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

technical support and professional services gross margin for the year ended december   remained relatively flat over the prior year 
product gross margin for the year ended december  was consistent with the prior year as lower margins on our product revenue  primarily due to lower average selling prices resulting from our new channel initiatives  were offset by a decrease in inventory write downs of excess and obsolete inventory 
technical support and professional services gross margin for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  increased primarily due to service revenue increasing at a higher rate than service expense

the benefit from income taxes for the year ended december  consisted of a million us income tax benefit  partially offset by million of foreign income tax expense 
the us income tax benefit is primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the us as of december   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the us  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences associated with deferred revenue and stock based compensation 
based upon our operating results over recent years and through june   as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations  during the second quarter of we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would ultimately realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets in the us as a result  during the second quarter  we released million of our valuation allowance  which was recorded as a one time tax benefit

table of contents our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate  as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law 
further  our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year  including from quarter to quarter  due to items arising from discrete events  including the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 
with respect to foreign earnings  it is our policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us accordingly  we do not provide deferred taxes on such earnings 
any excess tax benefit  above amounts previously recorded for stock based compensation expense  from the exercise of stock options is recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that cash taxes payable are reduced 
seasonality our product revenue has tended to be seasonal  with a significant portion generated in the third and fourth quarters 
revenue from our government customers has been influenced by the september th fiscal year end of the us federal government  which has historically resulted in our revenue from government customers being highest in the second half of the year 
in the fourth quarter  revenues have historically been strong due to purchases by north american enterprise customers  which operate on a calendar year budget and often wait until the fourth quarter to make their most significant capital equipment purchases 
in addition  increased fourth quarter sales in europe have historically resulted in higher fourth quarter revenues following a decline in sales in the summer months due to vacation practices in europe and the resulting delay in capital purchase activities until the fall 
while we expect these historical trends to continue  they could be affected by a number of factors  including another decline in general economic conditions  changes in the timing or amounts of us government spending  and our planned international expansion 
the timing of transactions could materially affect our quarterly or annual product revenue 
quarterly timing on a quarterly basis  we have usually generated the majority of our sales in the final month of the quarter 
we believe this occurs for two reasons 
first  many customers wait until the end of the quarter to extract favorable pricing terms from their vendors  including sourcefire 
second  our sales personnel  who have a strong incentive to meet quarterly sales targets  have tended to increase their sales activity as the end of a quarter nears  while their participation in sales management review and planning activities is typically scheduled at the beginning of a quarter 
the timing of our quarter end and year end shipments also affects our quarterly and annual product revenue  since we typically recognize revenue upon shipment of the product  and orders received at the end of a quarter or year may not be shipped until the beginning of the following quarter or year 
non gaap financial measures adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share  adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations as a percentage of revenue in evaluating the operating performance of our business  we exclude certain charges and credits that are required by gaap 
we believe these non gaap results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding i stock based compensation  which does not involve the expenditure of cash  ii amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  which does not involve the expenditure of cash  and iii other acquisition related expenses  which are unrelated to the ongoing operation of our business in the ordinary course 
for  based on our current tax structure  we expect non gaap results to be adjusted to reflect the effect of an assumed tax rate of 
we believe this adjustment provides useful information to both management and investors 
free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures 
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to 
table of contents management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that  after the purchase of property and equipment  can be used for strategic opportunities  including investing in the business  making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities used in investing activities provided by financing activities increase net cash at beginning of period net cash at end of period investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of our net income of million adjusted for a net cash inflow of million of net non cash revenues and expenses  offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of million  which include a payment of million for a long term contract for a third party to provide maintenance and support services for certain product offerings 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of our net income of million adjusted for a net cash inflow of million of net non cash revenues and expenses  which includes million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  and a net cash inflow of million for changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of our net income of million adjusted for a net cash inflow of million for net non cash revenues and expenses and a net cash inflow of million for changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of investments of million  million for acquisition related payments and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by maturities of investments of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of investments of million  million related to our acquisition of immunet and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by maturities of investments of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million  offset by maturities of investments of million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december   and was primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based plans  as well as the excess tax benefits relating to share based payments 
liquidity requirements we manufacture our products through contract manufacturers and other third parties 
this approach provides us with the advantage of relatively low capital expenditure requirements and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
the majority of our products are delivered to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers 
accordingly  our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the components required to produce our products  and they invoice us when the finished goods are shipped 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture and lab and test equipment 

table of contents we expect our short term liquidity requirements through december  will consist primarily of the funding of working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we expect to meet these short term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements  we expect to fund these amounts through the use of existing cash and investment resources 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and working capital of million 
as described above  our product sales are  and are expected to continue to be  highly seasonal 
we believe that our current cash reserves are sufficient for any short term needs arising from the seasonality of our business 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our operating leases 
we expect to meet these long term requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
in addition  we may utilize existing cash resources  equity financing or debt financing to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments due to immunet shareholders we purchase components for our products from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon information we provide 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
as of december   we had total purchase commitments for inventory of approximately million due within the next months 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to inherent uncertainty  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period payments will be made 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of 
table of contents judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from arrangements that include hardware products with embedded software  software licenses and royalties  technical support  and professional services 
revenue from products in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations consists primarily of sales of hardware appliances containing software  but also includes fees and royalties for the license of our technology in a software only format and subscriptions to receive rules released by the vulnerability research team  or vrt  that are used to update the appliances for current exploits and vulnerabilities 
technical support  which generally has a contractual term of months  includes telephone and web based support  software updates  and rights to software upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services include training and consulting 
for each arrangement  we recognize revenue when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists eg  a signed contract  b delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions  c the fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection of the fee is deemed probable 
for sales through resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers and distributors provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
to the extent that a reseller or distributor requests an inventory or stock of products  we defer revenue on that product until we receive notification that it has been sold through to an identified end user 
all amounts billed or received in excess of the revenue recognized are included in deferred revenue 
in addition  we defer all direct costs associated with revenue that has been deferred 
these amounts are included in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or inventory in the accompanying balance sheets  depending on the nature of the costs and the reason for the deferral 
in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance any tangible products containing software components and non software components that operate together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
in addition  the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple element revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate elements  ii require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price  or besp  if neither vsoe or tpe is available  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each element within the arrangement 
we adopted this accounting guidance on january  on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after december  the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that operate together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and are no longer accounted for under the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 

table of contents our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliance  but is not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
stand alone software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software 
stand alone software sales continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for stand alone software sales after december   and for all transactions containing software entered into prior to the first quarter of  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vsoe 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for each of the deliverables  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which sufficient vsoe of fair value can be determined for any undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
if the only undelivered elements are elements for which we currently have vsoe of fair value  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based on the residual method 
when vsoe of fair value does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
for all transactions originating or materially modified after december   we recognize revenue in accordance with the amended accounting guidance 
certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have stand alone software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance 
the revenue for all of our other multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to each element based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue recognition guidance 
we have established vsoe of fair value for substantially all of our technical support based upon actual renewals of each type of technical support that is offered and for each customer class 
technical support and technical support renewals are currently priced based on a percentage of the list price of the respective product or software and historically have not varied from a narrow range of values in the substantial majority of our arrangements 
revenue related to technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period of the technical support arrangement  which is generally months 
the vsoe of fair value of our other services is based on the price for these same services when they are sold separately 
revenue for professional services that are sold either on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element arrangements is deferred and recognized as the services are performed 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our non software deliverables using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  customer classes and geographies and distribution channels 
for our non software deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use besp to determine our selling price 
for our services  we generally use vsoe to determine our selling price 
for certain arrangements we are able to account for more transaction consideration upon delivery than allowed under the prior guidance  primarily due to more deliverables being accounted for as separate units of accounting and the elimination of the use of the residual method under the amended revenue recognition guidance and a requirement to allocate arrangement consideration using a selling price hierarchy 

table of contents an estimate of the revenue that would have been reported if we had applied the new revenue recognition guidance for the year ended december  is million compared to the million of revenue recognized under the industry specific software revenue recognition rules 
we record taxes collected on revenue producing activities on a net basis 
changes in our judgments and estimates about these assumptions could materially impact the timing of our revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and stock purchased under our amended and restated employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of stock options granted and for employee stock purchases under the espp 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility 
additionally  the recognition of expense requires the estimation of the number of options that will ultimately vest and the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
the fair value of stock based awards is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we rely on historical experience of employee turnover to estimate our expected forfeitures 
the key assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation of stock options granted under the stock incentive plan  or plan  and the stock incentive plan  or plan  and espp grants include the following average risk free interest rate this is the average us treasury rate  with a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the option  as of the grant date 
expected dividend yield we use an expected dividend yield of zero  as we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected life this is the period of time that the stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and espp grants are expected to remain outstanding 
as we do not yet have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock options granted  we have based our expected term on the simplified method 
this estimate is derived from the average midpoint between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term 
in future periods  we expect to begin to incorporate our own data in estimating the expected life as we develop appropriate historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
for espp grants  the expected life is the plan period 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
for stock options granted  since our historical stock data from our ipo in march is less than the expected life of the stock options  we have used a blended volatility to estimate expected volatility 
the blended volatility includes a weighting of our historical volatility from the date of our ipo to the respective grant date and an average of our peer group historical volatility consistent with the expected life of the option 
our peer group historical volatility includes the historical volatility of companies that are similar in revenue size  are in the same industry or are competitors 
we expect to continue to use a larger proportion of our historical volatility in future periods as we develop additional historical experience of our own stock price fluctuations considered in relation to the expected life of the option 

table of contents for espp grants  we use our historical volatility since we have historical data available since our ipo  which is consistent with the expected life 
if we were to employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we were to decide to use a different valuation model  the amount of expense recorded in future periods could differ significantly from what we have recorded in recent periods 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  which are characteristics that are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may be significantly different than the actual values upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency between past and future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
our stock awards are generally subject to service based vesting  however  in some instances  awards contain provisions for acceleration of vesting upon achievement of performance measures  change in control and in certain other circumstances 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the probability of achieving performance measures and adjust stock based compensation expense accordingly 
the stock based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the estimated vesting period 
stock based compensation expense may fluctuate within a fiscal year  including from quarter to quarter  based on the probability of achieving those performance measures 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  temporary differences associated with stock based compensation expense and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
with respect to foreign earnings  it is our policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us accordingly  we do not provide deferred taxes on such earnings 
any excess tax benefit  above amounts previously recorded for stock based compensation expense  from the exercise of stock options is recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that cash taxes payable are reduced 
because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions  in i calculating income tax expense  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and 
table of contents iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return allowance 
we make estimates regarding the collectability of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical write off experience  the need for specific customer reserves  the aging of our receivables  customer creditworthiness and changes in customer payment cycles 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate based on actual results 
if any of the factors used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts change or if the allowance does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  changes to our provision for doubtful accounts may be needed  and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
we also use our judgment to make estimates regarding potential future product returns related to reported product revenue in each period 
we analyze factors such as our historical return experience  current product sales volumes  and changes in product warranty claims when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
if any of the factors used to calculate the sales return allowance were to change  we may experience a material difference in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any given period 
inventory 
inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis  or market value  except for evaluation and advance replacement units which are stated at the lower of cost  on a specific identification basis  or market value 
evaluation units are used for customer testing and evaluation and are predominantly located at the customers premises 
advance replacement units  which include fully functioning appliances and spare parts  are used to provide replacement units under technical support arrangements if a customer s unit is not functioning properly 
we make estimates of forecasted demand for our products  and inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our estimated demand is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  the timing of new product introductions and age 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of future demand for our products could change in the near term and result in additional inventory write downs  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date 
our investments are comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  commercial paper  government sponsored enterprise securities  government securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments have been classified as available for sale 
available for sale investments are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
amortization is included in interest and investment income 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included in interest and investment income 
we evaluate our investments on a regular basis to determine whether an other than temporary impairment in fair value has occurred 
if an investment is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the investment  or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and is charged against earnings for the period 
for investments that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the investment  but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis  the credit component of the other than temporary impairment is charged against earnings for the applicable period and the non credit component of the other than temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
unrealized losses entirely caused by non credit related factors related to investments for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued revised guidance to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
entities are allowed to first assess qualitative factors to 
table of contents determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a greater than percent likelihood exists that the fair value is less than the carrying amount then a two step goodwill impairment test must be performed 
this accounting guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe this guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk nearly all of our revenue is derived from transactions denominated in us dollars  even though we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as a result  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound  singapore dollar  brazilian real and japanese yen  associated with operating expenses of  and cash held in  our foreign operations 
however  we believe this exposure is not material at this time 
as we grow our international operations  our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling approximately million at december  the cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes while investments  made in accordance with our conservative investment policy  take advantage of higher interest income yields 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short and long term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
credit market risk we invest our cash in accordance with an established internal policy and our investments are comprised of money market funds  corporate debt investments  commercial paper  government sponsored enterprise securities  government securities and certificates of deposit  that historically have been highly liquid and have matured at their full par values 
therefore  we believe our credit market risk is not material at this time 
however  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges with respect to our investments as a result of volatility in financial markets or other factors
