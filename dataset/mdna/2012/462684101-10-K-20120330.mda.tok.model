the reduction in gross margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in direct margins as a result of increased sales of lower margin systems

in november  the company entered into a license and distribution agreement with alcon for the iridex greentip softtip cannula family of products 
as part of the agreement alcon agreed to pay million at signing as a settlement of past legal claims 
the company has treated this as part of its ongoing business and therefore as part of operating income because the agreement has established on ongoing commercial relationship that will benefit the company s continuing business in subsequent periods

the company anticipates receiving an additional million in other income from the settlement  to be paid to the company on april  the company revalues the fair value of the contingent earn out liability it owes to retinalabs as a consequence of the asset purchase agreement the company entered into with retinalabs on a quarterly basis 
as a result of entering into the license and distribution agreement with alcon for the greentip cannulas which the company purchased from retinalabs  the company determined that the fair value of the earn out had increased by million and the expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes on continuing operations of million and an effective tax rate of for fiscal year similar to a provision for income taxes of million and an effective tax rate of for fiscal year our tax rate is benefiting from a reduction in the valuation allowance we currently have booked against our deferred tax asset 
ultimately  assuming we remain profitable  the entire valuation reserve will be released and our tax rate will return to more normal levels

table of contents contractual payment obligations our contractual payment obligations that were fixed and determinable as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total and thereafter operating leases payments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations are presented and accounted for in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  asc 
when a qualifying component of the company is disposed of or has been classified as held for sale  the operating results of that component are removed from continuing operations for all periods presented and displayed as discontinued operations if a elimination of the component s operations and cash flows from the company s ongoing operations has occurred or will occur and b significant continuing involvement by the company in the component s operations does not exist after the disposal transaction 
on december  we entered into an agreement to sell our aesthetics business to cutera  inc the sale of the aesthetics business was completed on february  the operating results of our aesthetics business were therefore classified as discontinued operations  and the associated assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale for all periods presented under the requirements of asc revenue recognition 
our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles  delivery devices  consumables and service and support activities 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized 
the company s sales may include post sales obligations for training or other deliverables 
for revenue arrangements such as these  we recognize revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements section of subtopic of the accounting standards codification asc 
when the company has objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  it defers revenue attributable to the post sale obligations and recognizes such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  the company defers all revenue related to the transaction until all elements are delivered 
revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract 
we recognize repair service revenue upon completion of the work 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory physically held at the company s facility  sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolete or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of revenues 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality issues 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant 
table of contents management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our provision for sales returns is recorded net of the associated costs 
similarly management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non payment by customers to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
as sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
in addition  in the event that customers were to delay their payments to us  the levels of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on past payment history with the customer  analysis of the customer s current financial condition  the aging of the accounts receivable balance  customer concentration and other known factors 
warranty 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the product specifications 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as cost of revenues 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
under asc  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
in and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income 
in future periods if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under asc  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interests and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the impact on adoption of asc is more fully described in note accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s service period 
stock based compensation expense for fiscal included compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of asc stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we determined that the black scholes option pricing model is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 

table of contents recently issued and adopted accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this standard is intended to simplify how entities  test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year and does not expect its adoption to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it does not  however  change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 in order to redeliberate the portion of the earlier asu relating to presentation of reclassifications from other comprehensive income 
both updates are required for us the first quarter of  applied retrospectively 
as asu and asu are only presentation standards  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we transact the majority of our business in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign currency rates will not have a significant impact on our income statement or cash flows 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international sales  our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions may increase 
we currently do not engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of the currency fluctuation  but we may do so in the future
