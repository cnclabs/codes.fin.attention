table of contents overview company background we are a leading global provider of financial services technology 
we provide account processing systems  electronic payments processing products and services  internet and mobile banking systems  and related services 
we serve approximately  clients worldwide including banks  thrifts  credit unions  investment management firms  leasing and finance companies  retailers  merchants and government agencies 
the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years  and we have experienced high contract renewal rates with our clients 
the majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are  therefore  non discretionary in nature 
our operations are primarily in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products payments segment  the financial institution services financial segment and the corporate and other segment 
the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services  debit and other card based payment products and services  internet and mobile banking software and services  and other electronic payments software and services including account to account transfers and person to person payments 
our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts  card and print personalization services  and fraud and risk management products and services 
the financial segment provides banks  thrifts and credit unions with account processing services  item processing and source capture services  loan origination and servicing products  cash management and consulting services  and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 
in september  we acquired cashedge inc cashedge  a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account to account transfer  account opening and funding  data aggregation  small business invoicing and payments  and person to person payments  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
the acquisition of cashedge is expected to advance our digital payments strategies 
in the first quarter of  we acquired mobile commerce ltd 
m com  an international mobile banking and payments provider  and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
m com enhances our mobile and payments capabilities  and the other acquired companies add to or enhance specific products or services that we already provide 
enterprise priorities we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best in class results for our clients 
these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses  enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships  improving operational effectiveness  being disciplined in our allocation of capital  and differentiating our products and services through innovation 
our key enterprise priorities for are i to deliver improved financial performance including an increased level of high quality revenue growth  ii to further center the fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions  and iii to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients 
industry trends market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally 
as a result  financial institutions have 
table of contents exercised caution in their information technology spending 
despite this environment  in  our revenue increased  to billion  as compared to  net income per share from continuing operations increased to  which included a charge of per share for the loss on early debt extinguishment  as compared to  and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million 
we believe this revenue growth demonstrates the resilience of our recurring fee based revenue model  the largely non discretionary nature of our products and services  and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry 
in recent years  many of our financial institution clients have finalized their spending decisions later in the year 
as a result  we have seen  and expect to continue to see  a larger percentage of our annual revenue occurring in the second half of the year 
we believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that we provide to help them win and retain customers  generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency 
we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions 
in each of and  approximately of all financial institutions in the united states failed or were subject to government action 
the number of government actions and the average size of institutions impacted by such actions decreased in as compared to these reductions resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients 
in  we believe that the number of government actions will continue to decline as compared to bank failures and forced consolidations have been  to some extent  offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions 
a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform  or elects to move to one of our platforms  and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected 
consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi year client contracts 
these fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated 
we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 
in addition  legislation such as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has generated  and will continue to generate  numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry 
it is too early  however  to fully determine the overall impact of this complex legislation on us or our clients over the long term 
business developments we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments  including person to person payments  mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services  account processing  including acumen  our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions  and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions 
we believe our wide range of market leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace 
critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require significant judgments 
we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in  we early adopted guidance from the financial accounting standards board related to the assessment of qualitative factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first assess numerous qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values 
examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price  our financial performance  market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units 
if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then we perform a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the most recent fair value estimates  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
based on our impairment assessments in  we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than letters of credit 
we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates  managing our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenue  which in represented of our consolidated revenue  is primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed 
processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services 
cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel  equipment and data communication  infrastructure costs  including costs to maintain software applications  client support  depreciation and amortization  and other operating expenses 
product product revenue  which in represented of our consolidated revenue  is derived from integrated print and card production and software licenses

we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in senior term loan we maintain an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks 
term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate and mature in november the weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was at december  the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below 
at december   a portion of our term loan borrowings  million  was classified in our consolidated balance sheet as long term debt because we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long term basis and could do so under our revolving credit facility that expires in senior notes in june  we issued billion of senior notes comprised of million of senior notes due in june and million of senior notes due in june  which pay interest semi annually on june and december of each year

shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof

we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock

the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease below investment grade  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt  investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
in connection with processing electronic payments transactions  the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable recipients 
these subscriber funds are invested in short term instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government 
subscriber funds are not included in our consolidated balance sheets and can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment and debit card activity 
based on average subscriber funds balances during of approximately billion  a increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual pre tax income by approximately million  and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero  our annual pre tax income would decrease by less than million 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of billion and forward starting swaps with total notional values of million at december  to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by less than million 
we conduct business in the united states and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non us dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
in  of our total revenue was from clients in foreign countries 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at december   there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position
