non us gaap financial measures throughout this annual report  we present our operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful  useful and transparent to anyone using this financial information to evaluate our performance 
in addition to the us gaap presentation of net loss  we show certain statutory reporting information and other non us gaap financial measures that we believe are valuable in managing our business and drawing comparisons to our peers 
these measures are operating loss  gross premiums written  net premiums written  and underwriting ratios 
following is a list of non us gaap measures found throughout this report with their definitions  relationships to us gaap measures and explanations of their importance to our operations 
operating loss operating loss represents one measure of the pretax profitability of our segments and is derived by subtracting direct segment expenses from direct segment revenues 
revenues and expenses are presented in the consolidated statements of operations  but are not subtotaled by segment 
however  this information is available in total and by segment in note  segmented information to the consolidated financial statements  regarding reportable segment information 
the nearest comparable us gaap measure is loss before income tax benefit which  in addition to operating loss  includes net investment income  net realized gains on investments  gain loss on change in fair value of debt  other income  general and administrative expenses  restructuring costs  interest expense  amortization of other intangible assets  goodwill impairment  gain on buy back of debt and consolidation of debt  and equity in net income of investee 
gross premiums written while net premiums earned is the related us gaap measure used in the consolidated statements of operations  gross premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures insurance business produced before the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an overall gauge of gross business volume in insurance underwriting with some indication of profit potential subject to the levels of our retentions  expenses and loss costs 
net premiums written while net premiums earned is the related us gaap measure used in the consolidated statements of operations  net premiums written is the component of net premiums earned that measures the difference between gross premiums written and the impact of ceding reinsurance premiums  but without respect to when those premiums will be recognized as actual revenue 
we use this measure as an indication of retained or net business volume in insurance underwriting 
it provides some indication of profit potential subject to our expenses and loss costs 
underwriting ratios kingsway  like many insurance companies  analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as combined  expense and loss ratios 
the loss ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of commissions and premium taxes and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
a combined ratio below demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over demonstrates an underwriting loss 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined 
the critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill recoverability  deferred policy acquisition costs  and fair value assumptions for debt obligations 
provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses a significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events 
as such  the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined 
the process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals  including the opinions of the company s actuaries 
further information regarding estimates used in determining our provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is discussed in the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses section of part i  item of this annual report and note  unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  to the consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment  actuarial studies  professional experience and expertise of the company s claims departments personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims  the quality of the data used for projection purposes  existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices  the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs  court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
during  the company moved responsibility for evaluating and setting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses to an internal process  with the objective of increasing consistency and accountability relating to variability of the provision 
the provision is evaluated by the company s actuaries with the results then shared with management  which is responsible for establishing the provision recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the year end actuarial review process  an analysis of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is completed for each insurance subsidiary 
unpaid losses  allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are separately analyzed by line of business or coverage by accident year 
a wide range of actuarial methods are utilized in order to appropriately measure ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense costs 
these methods include paid loss development  incurred loss development  paid bornhuetter ferguson  incurred bornhuetter ferguson  berquist sherman paid method  berquist sherman reported method and frequency severity method 
reasonability tests such as average outstanding provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses  ultimate loss trends and ultimate allocated loss adjustment expense to ultimate loss are also performed prior to selection of the final provision 
the provision is indicated by line of business or coverage and is separated into case reserves  ibnr reserves and a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
because the establishment of the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  current provisions may need to be updated 
adjustments to the provision  both favorable and unfavorable  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which such estimates are updated 
the company s actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid point of the high and low estimates of the range 
valuation of fixed maturities and equity investments our equity investments are recorded at fair value using quoted prices from active markets 
for fixed maturities  we use observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets  quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments  benchmark interest rates  broker quotes and other relevant inputs 
we do not have any investments in our portfolio which require us to use unobservable inputs 
any change in the estimated fair value of our investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss we have recorded  which could change the amount we have recorded for our investments and other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first in first out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations 
premium and discount on investments are amortized and accredited using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income 
the establishment of an other than temporary impairment on an investment requires a number of judgments and estimates 
we perform a quarterly analysis of the individual investments to determine if declines in market value are other than temporary 
the analysis includes some or all of the following procedures  as applicable identifying all unrealized loss positions that have existed for at least six months  identifying other circumstances which management believes may impact the recoverability of the unrealized loss positions  obtaining a valuation analysis from third party investment managers regarding the intrinsic value of these investments based on their knowledge and experience together with market based valuation techniques  reviewing the trading range of certain investments over the preceding calendar period  assessing if declines in market value are other than temporary for debt instruments based on the investment grade credit ratings from third party rating agencies  assessing if declines in market value are other than temporary for any debt instrument with a non investment grade credit rating based on the continuity of its debt service record  determining the necessary provision for declines in market value that are considered other than temporary based on the analyses performed  and assessing the company s ability and intent to hold these investments at least until the investment impairment is recovered 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the assessment methodology used to determine declines in market value that are other than temporary include  but may not be limited to  the following the opinions of professional investment managers could be incorrect  the past trading patterns of individual investments may not reflect future valuation trends  the credit ratings assigned by independent credit rating agencies may be incorrect due to unforeseen or unknown facts related to a company s financial situation  and the debt service pattern of non investment grade instruments may not reflect future debt service capabilities and may not reflect a company s unknown underlying financial problems 
the company did not recognize any impairment related to its fixed maturities or equity investments that was considered other than temporary for the years ended december  and valuation of deferred income tax assets the provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of deferred income tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
in making this determination  management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances  including the company s past and anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of a company s deferred income tax asset balances when significant negative evidence exists 
cumulative losses are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the company maintains a valuation allowance of million  million of which relates to its us deferred income taxes 
the largest component of the us deferred income tax asset balance relates to tax loss carryforwards that have arisen as a result of the continued losses of the company s us operations 
uncertainty over the company s ability to utilize these losses over the short term has led the company to record a valuation allowance 
future events may result in the valuation allowance being adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence were to arise in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets would meet the more likely than not standard  the valuation allowance would be reversed in the period that such a conclusion were reached 
valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill recoverability goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment annually as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  by applying a fair value based test 
in determining fair value  valuation models such as price to earnings ratios and other multiples are used 
management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of a reporting unit that may affect any resulting impairment write down 
this includes assumptions regarding fluctuations in future earnings from the reporting units 
management then compares the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  a second step of impairment is performed to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount 
in connection with the annual impairment assessment performed as of december   all reporting units were tested 
based on the assessment  an impairment provision of million has been recorded against the goodwill of the company related to the itasca acquisition described in the acquisitions  discontinued operations and dispositions section in item of this annual report 
the company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill related to the itasca acquisition exceeded its fair value and  therefore  was not recoverable 
the determination that the fair value of the goodwill was less than its carrying value resulted primarily from a decline in the quoted value of kingsway s common stock as compared to the book value per share of the company at december  additional information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets accounting is included in note  goodwill and intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions  advertising  premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing policies  are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related policies 
management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset 
a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income 
fair value assumptions for debt obligations our lroc preferred units  senior unsecured debentures and subordinated debt are measured and reported at fair value 
the fair value of the lroc preferred units is based on quoted market prices  and the fair value of the subordinated debt is estimated using an internal model based on significant market observable inputs 
the fair values of senior unsecured debentures  for which no active market exists  are derived from quoted market prices of similar instruments or other third party evidence 
any change in the estimated fair value of our debt is reflected in the gain or loss on the change in fair value of debt we record in the consolidated statements of operations and in the carrying value for our debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
results of continuing operations a reconciliation of total segment net operating loss to net loss for the years ended december  and is presented in table below table segment net income loss for the years ended december in millions of dollars change segment operating income loss insurance underwriting insurance services total segment operating loss net investment income net realized gains gain loss on change in fair value of debt other income not allocated to segments general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments interest expense amortization of other intangible assets goodwill impairment gain on buy back of debt gain on consolidation of debt equity in net income of investees loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit income tax benefit loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes loss gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss loss from continuing operations  net loss and diluted loss per share in  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million per diluted share compared to a loss of million per diluted share in the loss from continuing operations in is attributable to operating losses in insurance underwriting and corporate general expenses  partially offset by the gain on the change in fair value of debt 
the loss in is largely due to insurance underwriting operating loss  unrealized loss on fair value of debt and corporate general expenses 
in  these factors have been partially offset by net realized gains on investments and the buy back of the company s debt which resulted in a gain and lowered interest expense 
the company also recorded a gain on the consolidation of debt in in  we incurred a net loss of million compared to million in the diluted loss per share was for compared to a diluted loss per share of for insurance underwriting for the year ended december   insurance underwriting gross premiums written were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease 
net premiums written decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  net premiums earned decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in premiums written and earned is due to significant reductions in premium volumes in the non standard automobile line of business 
insurance underwriting has withdrawn from a number of states  increased its rate adequacy in the states where it continues to actively produce business and discontinued unprofitable programs and unaffiliated managing general agent relationships 
also contributing to the reduction in non standard automobile premium is the continuing poor economic conditions in much of the united states 
the non standard automobile insurance market tends to contract during periods of high unemployment as was experienced in the united states throughout the insurance underwriting operating loss decreased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses  as reflected in the loss ratio  against a smaller volume of net premiums earned 
the insurance underwriting loss ratio for was compared to for due to decreasing ultimate loss estimates for current and prior accident years 
this improvement was primarily driven by two factors 
first  unfavorable development of million recorded during in the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for losses incurred as of december  was less than the unfavorable development of million recorded during for losses incurred as of december  second  the increased premium rate adequacy which insurance underwriting implemented throughout is having a positive influence on the loss ratio for losses incurred during the insurance underwriting expense ratio was in and in this deterioration is a derivative effect of the decrease in net premiums earned cited above which has made it more difficult for insurance underwriting to cover its fixed overhead expenses 
in response to the shrinkage in its volume of business  insurance underwriting has been reducing its fixed overhead expenses 
the insurance underwriting combined ratio was in compared with in  reflecting the dynamics which affected the loss and expense ratios 
insurance services the insurance services service fee and commission income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of ars for the full year of following its acquisition effective june  see note  acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the ars acquisition 
the insurance services operating income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with an operating loss of million for the year ended december  this improvement reflects  in part  the inclusion of ars for the full year of  as noted above 
also  operating income was adversely affected by several one time charges  including million to adjust the insurance services deferred revenue liability  million to charge off receivables deemed uncollectible at nea  and million to terminate a legacy contract at nea related to its policy and claim administration system 
net investment income net investment income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is a result of several factors 
first  the company s total investments  cash and cash equivalents have declined approximately since december  as a result of reduced volumes of business and acceleration of claim payments in insurance underwriting as well as corporate debt buy backs and other corporate initiatives 
second  the percentage of the company s total investments  cash and cash equivalents which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents  which carry lower investment yields  has increased from approximately to approximately since december  as a result of the sales of investments to realize gains and an intention to maintain higher liquidity given the planned shrinkage of business in insurance underwriting and other corporate needs 
third  yields on fixed maturities remain at historically low levels such that reinvestment of maturing investments occurs at yields lower than the yields on the maturing investments 
net realized gains the company incurred net realized gains in of million compared to million in the net realized gains in each year primarily resulted from the liquidation of fixed maturities in insurance underwriting 
most of the material unrealized gains in the fixed income portfolios were realized in because of the relatively flat interest rate environment throughout  few additional material unrealized gains developed in the fixed income portfolios  leaving far less to realize when fixed maturities were liquidated during the third and fourth quarters of there were no impairments recorded during and for other than temporarily impaired investments 
gain loss on change in fair value of debt the gain on change in fair value of debt amounted to million in compared to a loss of million in the loss reflects an increase in the fair values  primarily during the first two quarters of  applicable to the larger debt balances outstanding prior to significant debt buy backs that occurred later in the gain reflects a decrease in fair values primarily during the second and third quarters of  of the company s outstanding debt 
other income not allocated to segments other income not allocated to segments was million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily related to a million decline in gains from foreign currency translation due to the company s reduced net asset base in canada following the jevco transaction combined with a smaller relative move in than in in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments general and administrative expenses not allocated to segments were million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to million of restructuring expenses recorded in see note  restructuring charges to the consolidated financial statements for further details  million more of insurance expense  including for director s officer s coverage  recorded in than in  million more of professional fees  including outside legal and audit  recorded in than in  and million more of salaries and benefits expense recorded in than in reflective of the increased staffing and higher operating costs related to the company s previous canadian operations 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared to million in the decrease is due to the repurchase of debt during and refer to gain on buy back of debt discussion below 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization expense for was million compared to million in the decrease was primarily related to the company s decision to reclassify certain intangible assets which had been subject to amortization to be treated as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not subject to amortization 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
goodwill impairment we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from our annual review of goodwill recoverability 
based on our assessment  we concluded that the carrying value of the itasca acquisition goodwill exceeded its fair value 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
gain on buy back of debt during  kingsway general partnership purchased and canceled million par value of its senior unsecured debentures with a carrying value of million for million  recording a gain of million 
during  kai and kingsway general partnership purchased and canceled million par value of its senior unsecured debentures with a carrying value of million for million  recording a gain of million 
gain on consolidation of debt during  the company recorded a gain of million related to the lroc preferred units held by kfs capital as a result of the consolidation of klroc trust 
the gain arose from the difference between the carrying value of the debt held by klroc trust and the fair value of the lroc preferred units held by kfs capital 
see note  acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the klroc trust consolidation 
equity in net income of investees effective december   we obtained a common equity interest in atlas financial holdings  inc  a financial services holding company 
in  we recorded million in earnings from this investment 
during  the company had no equity in net income from investees 
see note  investment in investees to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
income tax benefit income tax benefit on continuing operations for was million compared to million in the decrease in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to the establishment  in  of a million deferred tax liability related to indefinite life intangible assets and a million lower income tax benefit recorded in than in related to the company s canadian operations 
see note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
investments portfolio composition all of our investments are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents and investments with a fair value of million 
as of december   we held an investments portfolio comprised primarily of fixed maturities issued by the us government  government agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type  quality and concentration of investments 
our us operations typically invest in us dollar denominated instruments to mitigate their exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
table below summarizes the fair value of investments  including cash and cash equivalents  at the dates indicated 
table fair value of investments  including cash and cash equivalents as at december in millions of dollars  except for percentages type of investment of total of total fixed maturities us government  government agencies and authorities canadian government states municipalities and political subdivisions mortgage backed asset backed corporate total fixed maturities equity investments other investments short term investments total investments cash and cash equivalents total liquidity and cash flow risk table below summarizes the fair value by contractual maturities of the fixed maturities portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents at december  and table fair value of fixed maturities by contractual maturity date as of december in millions of dollars of total of total due in less than one year due in one through five years due after five through ten years due after ten years total at december   of fixed maturities  including treasury bills  government bonds and corporate bonds  had contractual maturities of five years or less 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
the company holds cash and high grade short term assets which  along with fixed maturities  management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other corporate obligations on a timely basis 
in the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to our policyholders  we believe that the high quality  liquid investments in the portfolios provide us with sufficient liquidity 
market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices 
given our us operations typically invest in us dollar denominated instruments and our relatively insignificant investment in equity instruments  our primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates 
because the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity  periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact our financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments 
during periods of rising interest rates  the market value of the existing fixed maturities will generally decrease and realized gains on fixed maturities will likely be reduced 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation 
credit risk arises from our positions in term deposits  corporate debt instruments and government bonds 
the investment and capital committee of the board of directors is responsible for the oversight of key investment policies and limits 
these policies and limits are subject to annual review and approval by the investment and capital committee 
the investment and capital committee is also responsible for ensuring that these policies are implemented and that procedures are in place to manage and control credit risk

management performs a quarterly analysis of our investments portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other than temporary 
further information regarding our detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other than temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within the critical accounting estimates and assumptions section of md a 
the length of time individual investments may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent us from recapturing the principal investment 
in cases of individual investments with a maturity date where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding  we would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures 
in situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal  the company may elect to sell investments at a loss 
at december   the gross unrealized losses amounted to million  and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non investment grade fixed maturities 
at each of december  and december   all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary 
fixed maturities in unrealized loss positions continued to pay interest and were not subject to material changes in their respective debt ratings 
we concluded that default risk did not exist at the time and  therefore  the declines in value were considered temporary 
as we have the capacity to hold these investments to maturity  no impairment provision was considered necessary 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events  ibnr loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses

the decrease is due to the reduction in the volume of non standard automobile premium written and an acceleration of claim payments  partially offset by unfavorable development described below 
commercial automobile at december  and  the gross provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for our commercial automobile business were million and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses was due to accelerated closure of open claims at ucc combined with ucc s exit from the commercial automobile markets

table identifies the relative contribution of the increases decreases in the provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the respective lines of business and accident years 
in  the majority of the unfavorable development occurred on the non standard automobile line of business and primarily relates to business written at mendota and amigo 
the adverse development is generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends 
original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims 
liquidity and capital resources the purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due 
the liquidity requirements of the company s business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations  disposal of discontinued operations  investment maturities and income and other returns received on investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments  debt servicing and other operating expenses 
the timing and amount of payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from our provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  which may create increased liquidity requirements 
cash flows during  the net cash used in operating activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was million 
this use of cash can be explained primarily by the decrease of million in the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the decrease of million in the unearned premium liability 
this combined million use of cash is the result of the previously explained decrease in the volume of business being written while at the same time the company is still responsible for paying loss and loss adjustment expenses related to losses incurred during years when the volume of business written was significantly higher than it was in the gross premiums written in are not expected to decline to the extent of the past few years which should moderate the net cash used in operating activities 
during  the net cash provided by investing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was million 
this source of cash was driven by proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities in excess of purchases of fixed maturities 
as previously explained  the company s insurance subsidiaries hold investments portfolios comprised primarily of fixed maturities issued by the us government  government agencies and high quality corporate issuers which are of generally short duration and are highly liquid which enables the insurance subsidiaries to meet their liquidity needs 
during  the net cash used in financing activities as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows was million 
this use of cash is explained by the company s repurchase of senior unsecured debentures for million 
see note  debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
see also table below for a schedule of remaining debt maturities by period 
in summary  as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company s net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during was million 
the company s insurance subsidiaries fund their obligations primarily through premium and investment income and maturities in the investments portfolio 
as a holding company  kingsway derives cash from its subsidiaries generally in the form of dividends and management fees to meet its obligations  which primarily consist of interest payments on debt as well as holding company operating expenses 
the operating insurance subsidiaries require regulatory approval for the return of capital and  in certain circumstances  prior to the payment of dividends 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries of the company were restricted from making any dividend payments without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations 
in the event that dividends and management fees available to the company are inadequate to service its obligations  the company would need to raise capital  sell assets or restructure its debt obligations 
the company believes that it has the flexibility to obtain the funds needed to meet its obligations and satisfy regulatory capital requirements 
debt covenants and buy backs certain debentures issued by the company contain negative covenants in their trust indentures  placing limitations and restrictions over certain actions without the prior written consent of the indenture trustees 
included in the negative covenants is the limitation on the incurrence of additional debt in the event that the total debt to total capital ratio or the senior debt to total capital ratio exceeds or  respectively 
the total debt is calculated on a pro forma basis taking into account the issuance of additional debt 
the debentures also include covenants limiting the issuance and sale of voting stock of restricted subsidiaries  the payment of dividends or any other payment in respect of capital stock of the company  or the retirement of debt subordinate to the debentures covered by the trust indentures if  after giving effect to such payments as described in the trust indentures  the total debt to total capital ratio exceeds 
throughout and  the company has continued to experience losses 
the reduction in shareholders equity as a result of these ongoing losses can detrimentally impact the company s capital flexibility by triggering negative covenants in its trust indentures described above and or limiting the dividend capacity of the operating subsidiaries 
as of december   the company s total debt to total capital and senior debt to total capital ratios were and  respectively
