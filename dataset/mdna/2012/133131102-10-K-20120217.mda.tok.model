our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain noncontrolling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies

executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership  management  development  acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
as of december   we owned interests in  operated  or were developing multifamily properties comprising  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table 
in addition  we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 
property operations our results for the year ended december  reflect an increase in rental revenue as compared to  which we believe was primarily due to a gradually improving economy  favorable demographics  a modest supply of new multifamily housing  and a decrease in home ownership rates  which have resulted in increases in realized rental rates and average occupancy levels 
same store revenues increased as compared to we believe economic and employment conditions will improve slightly during and the supply of new multifamily homes will continue to be modest 
however  we believe significant risks to the economy remain prevalent  and while there has been a slight increase in employment levels in the majority of our markets  the unemployment rate remains at higher than historical levels 
if economic conditions in the united states were to worsen  our operating results could be adversely affected

table of contents as compared to was primarily due to the completion during the three months ended march  and subsequent lease up of a property by a fully consolidated joint venture of which we retain a ownership  which resulted in our recording depreciation and interest expense on the property  upon completion of construction  in excess of income recognized during the lease up period 
the decrease was also due to lower earnings associated with properties held by operating partnerships during as compared to funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  impairments of depreciable assets  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain noncontrolling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties  depreciation  and impairments of depreciable assets  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate investments between periods or as compared to different companies 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 
reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december are as follows september  september  september  in thousands funds from operations net income loss attributable to common shareholders real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties and discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture interests income loss allocated to noncontrolling interests funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of common share options and share awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted includes a million charge related to a loss on discontinuation of a hedging relationship for the year ended december  and an million impairment associated with land development activities for the year ended december  represents our proportionate share of the gain on sale relating to one of our unconsolidated joint venture s sale of four operating properties during the fourth quarter 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility  which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios  and using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity 
our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was approximately times for the year ended december  and approximately times for each of the years ended december  and this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses  non property income  other expenses  income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation  amortization  and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations 
at december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
our weighted average maturity of debt  including our line of credit  was years at december  for the longer term  we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations  maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
other sources include available cash balances  the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions  joint venture investments  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets  sources of financing  our ability to complete asset sales  the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets 
cash flows certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  and repurchases of debt and common shares  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon  among other factors  market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth in property revenues directly attributable to increased rental and occupancy rates from our stabilized communities and the growth in non stabilized communities as we consolidated three joint ventures during the second half of this increase in revenues was partially offset by the increase in property expenses from our stabilized and non stabilized communities which include the property expenses of these three 
table of contents joint ventures 
see further discussions of our operations as compared to in our results of operations 
the increase was further offset by a decrease in net cash from operating activities due to the timing of payments in operating accounts  primarily relating to the timing of payments relating to third party construction activities and the timing of interest payments 
these decreases from operating activities were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable receipts relating to third party construction activities 
net cash used by investing activities during the year ended december  totaled approximately million as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of approximately million during the year ended december  cash outflows for property development  acquisition  and capital improvements were approximately million during as compared to approximately million during due primarily to an increase in construction and development activity in as compared to and the acquisitions of acres of land for approximately million in august and acres of land for approximately million in december additionally  cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were approximately million during the year ended december  primarily relating to eighteen acquisitions completed by our funds  in which we own a interest  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  these outflows were partially offset by proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures in march these outflows were further offset by proceeds received from the sale of our available for sale investment of million during february  payments received on notes receivable from affiliates of approximately million and approximately million in distributions of investments from our joint ventures which included cash distributions of approximately million received from an unconsolidated joint venture s sale of operating properties in the fourth quarter of cash inflows from sales of properties including land and discontinued operations were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during  we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of two land development properties to one of our joint ventures  and approximately million from the sale of two operating properties to unaffiliated third parties 
during  we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of two operating properties and one land holding to unaffiliated third parties 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  during  we used approximately million to repay our outstanding million term loan in june and approximately million to retire maturing secured and unsecured notes 
also during  approximately million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and noncontrolling interest holders 
during this same period  net proceeds of approximately million was provided from the issuance of two series of unsecured notes completed in june  and net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of million common shares under our at the market atm share offering programs which offset these cash outflows 
these cash outflows were further offset by proceeds from common share options exercised during the period of approximately million 
financial flexibility in september  we amended our million unsecured credit facility to extend the maturity date from august to september with an option to extend to september additionally  we now have the option to increase this credit facility to million by either adding additional banks to the credit facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments 
the interest rate is based upon libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of days or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  with which we are in compliance 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  leaving approximately million available under our unsecured line of credit 
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to offer  from time to time  an unlimited amount of common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  or warrants 
our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to million shares of beneficial interest  consisting of million common shares and million preferred shares 
as of december   we had approximately 
table of contents million common shares outstanding  net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements  and no preferred shares outstanding 
in january  we issued approximately million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately million in net proceeds 
in march  we announced the creation of an atm share offering program through which we could  but had no obligation to  sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million atm program  in amounts and at times as we determined  into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions 
the atm program was terminated and no further common shares are available for sale under the atm program 
in may  we created a second atm share offering program through which we can sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million atm program from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions 
we may  but have no obligation to  sell common shares through the atm share offering program in amounts and at times as we determine 
actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors  including  among others  market conditions  the trading price of our common shares  and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us 
as of the day of this filing  we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million remaining available for sale under the atm program 
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s and standard and poor s  which are currently baa and bbb  respectively  with stable outlooks  as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks  fannie mae  freddie mac  or life insurance companies 
however  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit 
during  approximately million of unsecured debt  including scheduled principal amortizations of approximately million  are scheduled to mature 
included in these maturities are four debt instruments of approximately million which have automatic one year extensions which we may or may not exercise at our election 
see note  notes payable  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 
additionally  we intend to incur approximately million of additional capital expenditures on our current development projects 
we intend to meet our near term liquidity requirements through available cash balances  cash flows generated from operations  draws on our unsecured credit facility  proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes  equity issued from our atm program  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in december  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of per share to our common shareholders of record as of december  the dividend was subsequently paid on january  we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units 
when aggregated with previous dividends  this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of per share or unit for the year ended december  the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  in millions total thereafter debt maturities interest payments non cancelable lease payments postretirement benefit obligations includes scheduled principal amortizations and does not include all available extension options 

table of contents includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes  medium term notes  and secured notes 
the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  or the most recent practicable date 
in january  we issued approximately million common shares in a public equity offering and received approximately million in net proceeds 
we utilized these proceeds to fund the acquisition of the interest not owned by us in twelve related joint ventures for approximately million and the repayment of approximately million in mortgage debt associated with these joint ventures 
in february  we redeemed the million outstanding series b cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units at their redemption price of per unit  or an aggregate of million  plus accrued and unpaid distributions 
in connection with this redemption  we expensed the unamortized issuance costs relating to these series b units  which will result in a charge to earnings of approximately million in the first quarter of off balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
as of december   we have no outstanding guarantees related to loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
we believe the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
in the application of gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods  and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets  and estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
principles of consolidation 
we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities vies  which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
if the investment is determined not to be a vie  then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities 
if we are the general partner in a limited partnership  or manager of a limited liability company  we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners non managing members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
accordingly  we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 

table of contents asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows  trends  strategic decisions regarding future development plans  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
when impairment exists  the long lived asset is adjusted to its fair value 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding a number of factors  including market rents  economic conditions  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in estimating fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  and discounted cash flow calculations which maximize inputs from a marketplace participant s perspective 
in addition  we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment  we will record an impairment charge 
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions  including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities 
we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses  it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets  properties under development  and land is currently recoverable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations  we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets 
any such material non cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition of operating real estate assets are expensed  and expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements  indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties  are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively 
included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
the estimates used by management require judgment  and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
asu requires entities to separately disclose the amounts and reasons for any transfers of assets and liabilities into and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  entities will be required to disclose quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for all level measurements and a description of the valuation processes in determining fair value 
in addition  asu requires entities to provide a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring level measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed  including the interrelationship between inputs 
entities will also be required to disclose information about when the current use of a non financial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use and the hierarchy classification for items whose fair value is not recorded on the balance sheet but is disclosed in the notes 
we do not anticipate changes to our existing classification and measurement of fair value when the amended standard becomes effective on january   however  we do expect our disclosures will be expanded as a result 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
additionally  asu requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income 
asu is effective for us beginning january  we do not expect asu to have a material effect on our financial statements as we currently present other comprehensive income components in a separate but consecutive statement 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  property plant equipment topic derecognition of in substance real estate a scope clarification  asu resolves the diversity in practice about whether the guidance under fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  property  plant  and equipment real estate sales  applies to the derecognition of in substance real estate when a parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary  as specified under asc subtopic  non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 that is in substance real estate as a result of default by the subsidiary on its nonrecourse debt 
the new guidance is intended to emphasize the accounting for such transactions which is based upon substance over form 
asu is effective for us beginning july  and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu indefinitely defers the requirements for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
entities will still be required to comply with the other aspects of asu as noted above 
asu is effective for us beginning january  and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and september  september  september  september  september  september  september  september  december  december  amount in millions weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total amount in millions weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate of total fixed rate debt variable rate debt december  included a million term loan entered into in and million of a construction loan entered into in which are effectively fixed by the use of interest rate swaps 
the million term loan was repaid in june 
the million construction loan interest rate swap matured and was not extended in conjunction with the one year extension of the loan in july 
table of contents we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility and increase our variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we have entered into  and may enter into in the future  interest rate swaps and caps to protect ourselves against fluctuations in the rates of our floating rate debt 
in connection with the repayment of the million loan in june  we discontinued the hedging relationship on the million interest rate swap on may  upon repayment of the loan  which eliminated the probable future variable monthly interest payments being hedged  we recognized a non cash charge of approximately million which included the accelerated reclassification of amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this swap 
due to the relatively short remaining life of the swap which matures in october and the low expectation of the swap becoming a significantly larger liability  management elected to leave this interest rate swap in place through its original maturity rather than cash settle the swap 
as a result  the changes in fair value of this swap have been marked to market through earnings in other income and other expense 
the fair value of our interest rate swap totaled approximately million as of december  during  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to this derivative instrument subsequent to the discontinuation of the hedging relationship 
non designated derivative financial instruments could expose us to credit risk and market risk 
our credit risk in this context is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
if the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty would owe us  which could create credit risk for us 
if the fair value of a derivative is negative we would owe the counterparty and  therefore  we would not be exposed to credit risk 
we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major  creditworthy financial institutions 
as part of our on going control procedures  we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity  thus minimizing credit risk concentration 
we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non performance is remote 
our market risk related to derivative financial instruments is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument which results from changes in interest rates 
we believe we minimize our market risk by monitoring the fair value of each financial instrument position
