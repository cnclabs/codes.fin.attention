critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of zoom s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect its reported assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
zoom based its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events  however  may differ markedly from current expectations and assumptions 
while there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting zoom s consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex  difficult and subjective estimates and judgments allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  asset impairment 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured

revenue is not recognized until title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer  which occurs upon delivery of goods  and objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions were met 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience taking into consideration the type of products sold  the type of customer  and the type of specific transaction in each arrangement 
revenues represent the invoiced value of goods  net of value added tax vat 
the company does not offer promotional payments  customer coupons  rebates or other cash redemption offers to its customers 
deposits or advance payments from customers prior to delivery of goods and passage of title of goods are recorded as advanced from customers 
company s subsidiary  nollec wireless is in the mobile phone design  software integration and mobile solution r d business  nollec wireless  recognizes revenue under percentage of completion method asc topic construction type and production type contracts when reasonably dependable estimates can be made and in which all the following conditions exist a 
contracts executed by the parties normally include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by the parties  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement 
b 
the buyer can be expected to satisfy all obligations under the contract

in our portables operations  revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized upon shipment or when purchased at company retail locations 
commission income is recognized upon activation of wireless communication services with t mobile 
allowance for doubtful accounts zoom maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when zoom assesses the realization of accounts receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
zoom initially records a provision for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience  and then adjusts this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of its accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  zoom considers i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable  iv its historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of the customer  and vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry as well as general economic conditions  among other factors 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables to determine their recoverability 
zoom regularly reviews the credit policies and procedures of its operating subsidiaries to ensure that procedures are appropriate to the company s risk management approach as well as the general economic environment 
income taxes zoom accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized when  in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
zoom adopted fin asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
zoom has engages tax preparers in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates to determine if the company is both fully compliant with applicable tax laws and is lawfully maximizing tax benefits to the company 
asset impairment zoom periodically evaluates the carrying value of other long lived assets  including  but not limited to  property and equipment and intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses 
zoom also utilizes judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses  including the applicable discount rate
