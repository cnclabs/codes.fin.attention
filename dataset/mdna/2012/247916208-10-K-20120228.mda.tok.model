item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results  included herein 
title to properties customarily in the oil and natural gas industry  only a perfunctory title examination is conducted at the time properties believed to be suitable for drilling operations are first acquired 
prior to commencement of drilling operations  a thorough drill site title examination is normally conducted  and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects 
typically  in connection with acquisitions  title reviews are performed on selected higher value properties 
we believe that we have good title to our oil and natural gas properties  some of which are subject to minor encumbrances  easements and restrictions 
significant oil and gas purchasers and product marketing oil and gas sales are made on a day to day basis under short term contracts at the current area market price 
the loss of any single purchaser would not be expected to have a material adverse effect upon our operations  however  the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production  which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive 
for the years ended december  and december   two purchasers accounted for or more of our oil and natural gas revenues marathon petroleum company llc and in and  respectively and plains marketing lp and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we had two significant purchasers that each accounted for or more of our oil and natural gas revenues marathon petroleum company llc and hunt crude oil supply co 

our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines  the available capacity in such pipelines  the demand for oil and natural gas  the effects of weather  and the effects of state and federal regulation 
our production in the gulf coast region is primarily from developed fields close to major pipelines or refineries and established infrastructure 
our production in the rocky mountain region is dependent on limited transportation options caused by oversubscribed pipelines and market centers that are distant from producing properties 
as of december   we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets  however  there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices 
oil marketing the quality of our crude oil varies by area  thereby impacting the corresponding price received 
as an example  in heidelberg field  one of our larger fields  and our other eastern mississippi non tertiary properties  our oil production is primarily light to medium sour crude and has historically sold at a significant discount to nymex prices 
however  during  our light to medium sour crude sold at an average premium of per barrel over nymex prices 
in western mississippi  the location of our phase tertiary operations  our oil production is primarily light sweet crude  which historically sold near  or at a modest premium to  nymex prices 
however  during  our oil production in this area sold for more than per barrel over nymex prices 
the premiums above nymex were more pronounced in the second half of and are attributable to the depressed nature of the west texas intermediate wti market in cushing  ok where nymex is valued relative to the other grades of waterborne crude oil eg  louisiana light sweet lls  poseidon  mars  mayan and brent 
the marketing of our rocky mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market centers in guernsey  wyoming  clearbrook  minnesota  and wood river  illinois 
shipments on some of the pipelines are oversubscribed and subject to apportionment 
we have currently been allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production  however  there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future 
expansion of pipeline and newly built rail infrastructure in the rocky mountain region is ongoing and  we believe  has somewhat greater stability in oil differentials in the area  although recent events resulting in wider than usual differentials in the current markets are expected to remain in place until incremental takeaway capacity comes on line 
for the year ended december  the discount for our oil production in the rocky mountain region averaged per bbl  compared to per bbl during overall  during  we sold approximately of our production based on the lls index price  although due to contract provisions we may not realize the full differential  of our production based on nymex or wti posting plus argus p prices  and based on various other indexes  most of which have also improved relative to wti  but to a lesser degree 

table of contents denbury resources inc natural gas marketing virtually all of our natural gas production in the gulf coast region is close to existing pipelines  consequently  we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas 
our gas production in the rocky mountain region  like our oil production  is dependent on limited transportation options that can affect our ability to find markets for it 
we sell the majority of our natural gas on one year contracts  with prices fluctuating month to month based on published pipeline indices and with slight premiums or discounts to the index 
we currently receive near nymex or henry hub prices for most of our natural gas sales in mississippi 
for the year ended december   we averaged per mcf above nymex prices for our mississippi natural gas production 
in the texas gulf coast region  due primarily to its location  the price we received for the year ended december  averaged per mcf above nymex prices 
the rocky mountain region natural gas production is sold at the wellhead on a percent of proceeds basis 
we receive a percentage of proceeds on both the residue natural gas volumes and the natural gas liquids volumes 
because there are a limited number of gas markets in this region  during we flared a significant portion of the natural gas produced in this region 
the natural gas has a significant component of propane  butanes and other higher density hydrocarbons  resulting in a measurable natural gas liquids stream 
for the year ended december   we averaged per mcf over nymex prices for our rocky mountain region natural gas production due primarily to the natural gas liquids extracted from the gas stream  improving the net price we receive 
in late  we amended the gas sales contracts for our bakken production to sell the natural gas liquids separately from the dry gas 
as a result  sales of natural gas liquids will be included in our oil sales in and future periods 
helium marketing we expect production to commence at riley ridge field during the second quarter of  at which time we will begin to supply helium to a third party purchaser under a year helium supply arrangement 
helium will be sold under the contract at a price that will fluctuate based on helium deliveries  cpi and other factors over the year term 
competition and markets we face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business  including acquisition of producing properties  oil and gas leases  and co properties  marketing of oil and natural gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity  available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gas gathering systems 
competition is also presented to a lesser extent by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil and other fossil fuels 
because of the nature of our core assets our tertiary operations and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of co in the gulf coast and rocky mountain regions  we believe that we are effective in competing in the market 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages 
there have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment  as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled 
these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment  services and personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
we cannot be certain when we will experience these issues  and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin  cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted 
federal and state regulations numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry 
additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly  and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance 
the following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us 
the future annual capital cost of complying with the regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be governed by several factors  including future changes to regulatory requirements 
however  management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the 
table of contents denbury resources inc surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include regulation of the size of drilling  spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units  and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws  which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
federal regulation of sales prices and transportation the transportation and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the us federal government and are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
in particular  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive us federal and state regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting the natural gas industry 
some of ferc s proposals may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
while our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to ferc regulation  our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc regulation 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress  ferc  state regulatory bodies and the courts 
we cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective and their effect  if any  on our operations 
federal energy and climate change legislation and regulation in october  as part of the emergency economic stabilization act  congress included a new tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration  including that achieved through enhanced oil recovery  as further modified by the american recovery and reinvestment act of  passed in february in early  the president signed the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of  which updates federal pipeline safety standards  increases penalties for violations  gives the transportation department authority for new damage prevention and incident notification  and directs the transportation department to prescribe new minimum safety standards for co pipelines  which could affect our operations and the costs thereof 
in future periods  congress may create new incentives for alternative energy sources and may also consider legislation to reduce emissions of co or other gases 
if enacted  such legislation could impose a tax or other economic penalty on the production of fossil fuels that  when used  ultimately release co  and could reduce the demand for and uses of oil  gas and other minerals and or increase the costs incurred by the company in its exploration and production activities 
the environmental protection agency epa has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for release of certain greenhouse gases  along with requirements for wells used for geologic sequestration 
at the same time  legislation to reduce the emissions of co or other gases could also create economic incentives for technologies and practices that reduce or avoid such emissions  including processes that sequester co in geologic formations such as oil and gas reservoirs 
natural gas gathering regulations state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements 
although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 
federal  state or indian leases our operations on federal  state or indian oil and gas leases  especially those in the rocky mountains  are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  the bureau of ocean energy management  the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement  the bureau of indian affairs  and other federal and state stakeholder agencies 
environmental regulations public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
our oil and natural gas production  saltwater disposal operations  injection of co  and our processing  handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm are subject to stringent regulation 
we could incur significant costs  including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product  third party claims for property damage and personal injuries  or fines and sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental or other laws 
changes in or more stringent enforcement of environmental laws could also result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures 
various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact our operations and costs 
these regulations include  among others  i regulations by the epa and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  ii the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  federal resource conservation and recovery 
table of contents denbury resources inc act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  property contamination including groundwater contamination  and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination  iii the clean air act and comparable state and local requirements  which may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations or could result in the imposition of economic penalties on the production of fossil fuels that  when used  ultimately release co  iv the oil pollution act of  which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states  v the resource conservation and recovery act  which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes  vi the endangered species act and counterpart state legislation  which protects endangered and threatened species and could include certain species present on our leases  such as the sage grouse  as threatened or endangered  and vii state regulations and statutes governing the handling  treatment  storage and disposal of norm 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although such compliance and regulations could cause significant delays  which may cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated 
estimated net quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and present value of estimated future net revenues internal controls over reserve estimates we engage degolyer and macnaughton  an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm located in dallas  texas  to prepare our reserve estimates  and we rely on their expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with sec rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic  petroleum engineering  and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the society of petroleum engineers entitled standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information revision as of february  
the person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a senior vice president at this consulting firm  he is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas  he received a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering at texas a m university in  and he has in excess of years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations 
denbury s vice president reserves and technology is primarily responsible for overseeing the independent petroleum engineering firm during the process 
our vice president reserves and technology has a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and over years of industry experience working with petroleum reserve estimates 
the company s internal reserve engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who both provide data to the independent petroleum engineer and prepare interim reserve estimates 
the internal reserve team reports directly to our vice president reserves and technology 
in addition  the company s board of directors reserves committee  on behalf of the board of directors  oversees the qualifications  independence  performance and hiring of the company s independent petroleum engineering firm and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of the company s oil and natural gas reserves

our oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist  nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage 
the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 
during  we provided oil and gas reserve estimates for to the united states energy information agency  which were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our form k for the year ended december  our proved nonproducing reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered from productive zones that are currently behind pipe 
since a majority of our properties are in areas with multiple pay zones  these properties typically have both proved producing and proved nonproducing reserves 
as of december   our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately mmboe  or approximately of our estimated total proved reserves 
our proved undeveloped oil reserves primarily relate to our co tertiary operations mmboe and bakken fields mmboe 
our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves are primarily located in our riley ridge field mmboe 
we consider the co tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production  because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with secondary recovery or tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production 
during  we spent approximately million to convert mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves were converted primarily through the expansion of our tertiary floods at delhi and tinsley fields mmboe and through additional drilling in the bakken mmboe 
the offsetting mmboe increase in our proved undeveloped reserves from december  to december  is primarily due to the acquisition of riley ridge field mmboe and new proved undeveloped reserves identified as a result of additional drilling in the bakken mmboe 

table of contents denbury resources inc as of december   less than of our proved undeveloped reserves have been held as proved undeveloped for a period greater than five years  all of which are tertiary reserves 
it is expected that the tertiary reserves will become proved developed reserves during the next several years as the remaining tertiary development at these fields is completed 
it is expected that the remaining non tertiary proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the next five years

pv value is a non gaap measure and is different from the standardized measure in that pv value is a pre tax number and the standardized measure is an after tax number 
the information used to calculate pv value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with fasc topic the difference between these two amounts  the discounted estimated future income tax in thousands was  at december    at december   and  at december  we believe that pv value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure because the standardized measure can be impacted by a company s unique tax situation  and it is not practical to calculate the standardized measure on a property by property basis 
because of this  pv value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts  banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties 
pv value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and gas properties 
pv value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under gaap  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure 
our pv value and the standardized measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
see glossary and selected abbreviations for the definition of pv value and see note  supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures unaudited  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about the standardized measure

risk factors oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
a substantial decrease in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial results 
our future financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows  and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties  depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future  especially given current world geopolitical conditions 
oil and natural gas prices have continued their volatility  with nymex oil prices per bbl increasing between year end and year end  and nymex natural gas prices per mmbtu decreasing by during the year 
natural gas prices declined an additional between december  and february  future decreases in commodity prices could require us to record full cost ceiling test write downs 
the amount of any future write down is difficult to predict and will depend upon oil and natural gas prices  the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent 
our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas 
this price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
oil prices are likely to affect us more than natural gas prices because oil comprised approximately of our production and of our december  proved reserves  with oil being an even larger percentage of our current production and future potential reserves and projects due to our focus on tertiary operations 
the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the supply of and demand for these commodities  which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  domestic governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuel sources  weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the gulf of mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations  and winter conditions in the rocky mountains that can delay or impede operations  market uncertainty  worldwide political events and conditions  including actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  and worldwide economic conditions 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements 
also  prices for oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem 
declines in oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue  but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
if the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned expenditures 
over the past years  oil prices have gone from near historic low prices around per bbl to record highs of approximately per bbl in july during the last half of  oil prices declined precipitously  ending that year at a nymex price of per bbl 
oil prices then reversed course  generally increasing through and  ending at a nymex price of per bbl and ending at a nymex price of per bbl 
if this volatility repeats itself  oil prices could decline to a level that makes our tertiary or bakken projects uneconomic 
if that were to happen  we may decide to suspend future expansion projects  and if prices were to drop below the cash break even point for an extended period of time  we may decide to shut in existing production  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have a practice of hedging approximately the next year and a half of production to mitigate the risks associated with price fluctuations see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts 
as of february   we have oil commodity derivative contracts in place covering approximately  bbls d during and  bbls d during the first three quarters of since operating costs do not decrease as quickly as commodity prices  it is difficult to determine a precise break even point for our tertiary projects 
based on prior history  we estimate our economic break even before corporate overhead  and based on expenses on these projects at current oil prices occurs at per barrel dollar costs in the per barrel range  depending on the specific field and area 

table of contents denbury resources inc the prices we receive for our crude oil often do not correlate with nymex prices 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production can vary from nymex oil prices depending on the quality of the crude oil we sell  the location of our crude oil production and the related markets we sell to  variations in prices paid based upon different indices used  and the pricing contracts and indices at which we sell production 
our nymex differentials on a field by field basis over the last few years have ranged from a positive per bbl to a negative per bbl 
on a corporate wide basis  our nymex differentials over the last few years have ranged from approximately per bbl above nymex oil prices to over per bbl below nymex prices 
these variances have been due to various factors and are difficult to forecast or anticipate  but they have a direct impact on the net oil price we receive 
natural gas price volatility has followed a different path during the last few years  with current prices depressed as a result of weak demand and significant natural gas storage in place  leading to excess gas supply 
nymex natural gas prices averaged per mmbtu during  per mmbtu during  per mmbtu during  and ended at per mmbtu 
as of february   we have natural gas commodity derivative contracts in place covering approximately  mmbtu d during our production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited 
our long term growth strategy is focused on our co tertiary recovery operations 
the crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends on having access to sufficient amounts of co our ability to produce this oil would be hindered if our supply of co were limited due to problems with our current co producing wells and facilities  including compression equipment  or catastrophic pipeline failure 
our anticipated future crude oil production is also dependent on our ability to increase the production volumes of co and inject adequate amounts of co into the proper formation and area within each oil field 
the production of crude oil from tertiary operations is highly dependent on the timing  volumes and location of the co injections 
if our crude oil production were to decline  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary co pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights of way  other permits  or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered 
the production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is also dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available co to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable 
our ongoing construction of co pipelines will require us to obtain rights of way not only from private landowners  but in certain areas  from the federal government if the proposed pipelines cross federal lands 
certain states where we operate are considering the adoption of laws and regulations that would limit or eliminate a state s ability to exercise eminent domain over private property  in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on  and additional requirements for  the exercise of eminent domain 
we also conduct operations on federal and other oil and gas natural leases that have species  such as the sage grouse  that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act  which could lead to material restrictions as to federal land use 
these sorts of laws  and regulations and court decisions  together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered  could inhibit our ability to secure rights of way or access land for current or future pipeline construction projects 
as a result  obtaining rights of way may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance and additional expenditures  which could delay our co pipeline construction schedule and initiation of operations of these pipelines  and or increase the costs of constructing those pipelines 
our level of indebtedness may adversely affect operations and limit our growth 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants related to such indebtedness  including covenants in our bank credit facility  we would be in default under our debt instruments 
this default could permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness  possibly resulting in our bankruptcy 
our ability to meet our obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices  and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
as of february   we had outstanding billion principal amount of subordinated notes at interest rates ranging from to at a weighted average interest rate of and million of bank debt secured by most of our properties 
at february   we had billion available on our bank credit facility 
we currently have a bank borrowing base of billion 
the next regularly scheduled semiannual redetermination of the borrowing base for our bank credit facility will be in may our bank borrowing base is adjusted at the banks discretion and is based in part upon external factors  such as commodity prices  over which we have no control 
if our then redetermined borrowing base is less than our outstanding borrowings under the facility  we will be required to repay the deficit over a period not to exceed four months 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under our bank credit facility in connection with our acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration of oil and natural gas producing properties 
further  our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas 
if oil and natural gas prices again decrease and remain at depressed levels for an extended period of time  our degree of leverage could increase substantially 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and would not be available for capital expenditures or other purposes  
table of contents denbury resources inc our level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes  our interest expense may increase in the event of increases in market interest rates  because bank borrowings are at variable rates of interest  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions may be greater as a result of our level of indebtedness  and increases in interest rates thereon  potentially restricting us from making acquisitions  introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  pay dividends and make certain investments may be limited by the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness limit  and our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in the economy and in our industry 
our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under such debt instruments which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
product price derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we currently  and may in the future  enter into derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counter party to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
in addition  these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
information as to these activities is set forth under market risk management in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements 
a worldwide financial downturn  such as the financial crisis  or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity  business and financial condition that we cannot predict 
liquidity is essential to our business 
our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long term or short term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing 
a prolonged credit crisis  including the current sovereign debt crisis in europe and related turmoil in the global financial system  could materially affect our liquidity  business and financial condition 
these conditions have adversely impacted financial markets and have created substantial volatility and uncertainty  and may continue to do so  with the related negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets 
negative credit market conditions could materially affect our liquidity and may inhibit our lenders from fully funding our bank credit facility or cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility costlier and more restrictive 
we are subject to semiannual reviews  as well as unscheduled reviews  of our borrowing base under our bank credit facility  and we do not know the results of future redeterminations or the effect of then current oil and natural gas prices on that process 
the economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
additionally  negative economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas  or lower prices for oil and natural gas  which could have a negative impact on our revenues 
our future performance depends upon our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we can successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities 
in the future  we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced  due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise  or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
further  the process of using co for tertiary recovery and the related infrastructure requires significant capital investment  up to four or five years prior to any resulting production and cash flows from these projects  heightening potential capital constraints 
if we do not continue to make significant capital expenditures  or if outside capital resources become limited  we may not be able to maintain our growth rate or meet expectations 

table of contents denbury resources inc during the last few years  we have acquired several fields at a significant cost because we believe that they have significant additional potential through tertiary flooding and we paid a premium price for these properties based on that assumption 
in addition  we plan to continue acquiring other oil fields that we believe are tertiary flood candidates 
we are investing significant amounts of capital as part of this strategy 
if we are unable to successfully develop the potential oil in these acquired fields  it would negatively affect the return on our investment on these acquisitions and could severely reduce our ability to obtain additional capital for the future  fund future acquisitions  and negatively affect our financial results to a significant degree 
oil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks 
drilling activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that new wells drilled by us will not discover commercially productive reservoirs or the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the gulf of mexico that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations  and winter conditions in the rocky mountain region that can delay or impede operations  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  and cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  equipment  pipelines and services 
our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including encountering well blowouts  cratering and explosions  pipe failure  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids  release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks 
the nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits  or  as in the case of environmental fines and penalties  cannot be insured 
we could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our co tertiary recovery projects require a significant amount of electricity to operate the facilities 
if these costs were to increase significantly  it could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations 
additionally  a portion of our production activities involve co injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators 
it is often difficult to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs 
if wells have not been properly plugged  we will have to modify the wells  which can increase costs  delay our operations and reduce our production 
certain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations 
certain of our operations in north dakota  montana and wyoming are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions and often in difficult terrain 
as a result  our operations may be delayed because of cold  snow and wet conditions 
during a harsh winter  certain operations may only be practical during non winter months 
unusually severe weather could delay certain of these operations  including the construction of co pipelines  the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells  and depending on the severity of the weather  could have a negative effect on our results of operations in this region 
further  certain of our operations are limited to certain time periods due to environmental regulations  which slow down our operations  cause delays and can have a negative effect on our results of operations 
shortages of oil field equipment  services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages 
during periods of high oil and natural gas prices  we have experienced shortages of equipment used in our tertiary facilities  drilling rigs and other equipment  as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with higher commodity prices 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate 
table of contents denbury resources inc increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  oilfield equipment and services  and personnel in our exploration and production operations 
we have experienced such equipment shortages and price increases particularly in the bakken play due to high demand for drilling rigs there 
these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin  cash flow and operating results and or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted  causing us to miss our forecasts and projections 
federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations and is used in the bakken formations we acquired as part of the encore merger 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
the epa  however  recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the federal safe drinking water act s sdwa underground injection control uic program by posting a new requirement that requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations 
the us energy policy act of  which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the sdwa  prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a uic permit 
although the epa has yet to take any action to enforce or implement this newly asserted regulatory authority  industry groups have filed suit challenging the epa s recent decisions 
at the same time  the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and various committees have been investigating hydraulic fracturing practices 
in addition  legislation was proposed in congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in  between and of our revenues were derived from operations related to hydraulic fracturing 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these and future initiatives  these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations  and fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements  increased monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping obligations  and also attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
at this time  it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law 
enactment of legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business 
numerous legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been proposed or are under consideration by the current federal administration  congress and various federal agencies 
among these proposals are climate change carbon tax legislation introduced in congress and epa greenhouse gas regulations  including decisions on the application of new source performance standards nsps for petroleum refineries due by november  proposals contained in the president s budget  along with legislation introduced in congress  none of which have passed congress  to impose new taxes on  or repeal various tax deductions available to  oil and gas producers  such as the current tax deduction for intangible drilling and development costs and the current deduction for qualified tertiary injectant expenses  which if eliminated could raise the cost of energy production  reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities  legislation being considered by congress that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the sdwa and new or anticipated interior department and epa regulations to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process  and the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act enacted in  which increases penalties  grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements  and directs the transportation department to prescribe minimum safety standards for co pipelines  any of which could affect company operations  their effectiveness and the costs thereof 
generally  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions and could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold 
until any such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted  it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of more than one of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
for the year ended december   two purchasers each accounted for more than of our oil and natural gas revenues and in the aggregate  for of these revenues 
however  the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production  which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive 
estimating our reserves  production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty 
estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs  and the assumed effect of governmental regulation 
there are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves  particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations 
forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations and the production rates anticipated therefrom requires estimates  one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
also  the use of a discount factor for reporting purposes  as 
table of contents denbury resources inc prescribed by the sec  may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor  given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could result in a reduction of the quantities and net present value of our reserves 
the reserve data included in documents incorporated by reference represent only estimates 
quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions  including oil and natural gas prices in existence at the date of assessment 
our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions  including oil and natural gas prices  as well as due to production results  results of future development  operating and development costs  and other factors 
downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and cost as of the date of the estimate 
as of december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  but these assumptions may not be accurate  and this may not occur 
substantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile 
to finance acquisitions  we may need to substantially alter or increase our capitalization through the use of our bank credit facility  the issuance of debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments  or by other means 
such changes in capitalization could significantly affect our risk profile 
additionally  significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business 
the character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location than our existing properties 
we may experience an impairment of our goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators  such as a significant reduction in the price of oil or natural gas  a full cost ceiling write down of oil and natural gas properties  or significant changes in the expected timing of production 
fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our goodwill is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates for goodwill since the results are based on estimated future cash flows and assumptions related thereto 
significant assumptions include estimates of future oil and natural gas prices  projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves  estimates of future rates of production  timing and amount of future development and operating costs  estimated availability and cost of co  projected recovery factors of reserves and risk adjusted discount rates 
we base our fair value estimates on projected financial information that we believe to be reasonable  however  actual results may differ from those projections 
a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft  data corruption  operational disruption  and or financial loss 
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day to day operations  including certain of our exploration  development and production activities 
we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves  process and record financial and operating data  analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business 
our technologies  systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations 
for example  unauthorized access to our seismic data  reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption  communication interruption  or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations 
to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks  however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities
