overview we are a leading provider of fourth generation  or g  wireless broadband services 
we build and operate next generation mobile broadband networks that provide high speed mobile internet and residential internet access services in communities throughout the country 
as of december   we offered our services in markets in the united states covering an estimated million people  including an estimated million people covered by our g mobile broadband networks in markets 
our g mobile broadband network provides a connection anywhere within our coverage area 
over the long term  we will need to greatly expand our revenue base by increasing sales to our existing wholesale partners  primarily sprint  and by adding additional wholesale partners 
to be successful with either  we believe it is necessary that we deploy lte  technology  which is currently being adopted by most wireless operators in the united states  including sprint  as their next generation wireless technology 
we believe that  as the demand for mobile broadband services continues its rapid growth  sprint and other service providers will find it difficult  if not impossible  to satisfy their customers demands with their existing spectrum holdings 
by deploying lte  we believe that we will be able to take advantage of our leading spectrum position to offer offload data capacity to sprint and other existing and future mobile broadband service providers for resale to their customers on a cost effective basis 
initially  we plan to overlay up to  of our existing mobile wimax sites with tdd lte  over mhz wide channels 
we plan to focus primarily on sites in densely populated urban areas where we currently experience the highest concentration of usage of our mobile wimax services  although we will also consider sites in other areas where sprint and other current and future wholesale partners express a need for excess data capacity and where we believe we will be most likely to generate sufficient revenues 
the success of our current plans will depend to a large extent on whether we succeed in the following areas adding new wholesale partners with substantial offload data capacity needs and generating or exceeding the revenue levels we currently expect for that portion of our business  maintaining our retail base and revenues while continuing to realize the benefits from cost savings initiatives  deploying lte technology on our network  and raising additional capital 
on december   we raised an aggregate of million in additional capital  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  through the equity offering and the sprint equity purchase 
we also recently expanded our wholesale agreement with sprint under which sprint will pay us million for unlimited g mobile wimax services for resale to its retail subscribers in and  approximately two thirds of which is payable for service provided in  and the remainder for service provided in of the million  million will be paid as an offset to principal and interest due under a million promissory note issued by us to sprint 
additionally  in january  we received an aggregate million of additional 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued proceeds from the issuance of first priority senior secured notes 
our results of operations  financial position and sources and uses of cash in the current and future periods reflect our focus on the following components of our business strategy revenue growth during the year ended december   consolidated revenue growth was compared to we ended the year with approximately million retail and million wholesale subscribers compared to million retail and million wholesale subscribers at the end of the prior year 
in  we will continue to focus on maximizing cash flow from our retail business and offering our retail subscribers choice and simplicity in our service offerings 
beginning on october   we rolled out a more streamlined service offering that is exclusively no contract  discontinues the equipment lease option in favor of a purchase only model  and does not impose any usage caps or overage charges 
sprint accounts for substantially all of our wholesale sales to date  and offers services in each of our g markets 
our new wholesale agreements with sprint will allow us to continue to leverage our current and developing technologies in our business 
however  to generate sufficient revenue to meet our needs over the long term  we must also focus on adding new wholesale partners with substantial offload data capacity needs that could utilize both or either of our wimax and planned lte networks 
operational efficiency while concentrating resources on revenue growth and our plans to deploy lte  we also intend to maintain our focus on maximizing cost saving opportunities 
the effect of the initiatives undertaken beginning in late  such as the managed network services agreement with ericsson  the transition of a substantial portion of our current customer care operations to teletech  other workforce reductions  termination of certain existing tower leases that are not currently used to provide service and increasing the use of lower cost sales channels  has led to changes in our cost structure with a goal of improving operating margins 
each of these actions has lowered our operating costs and our need for additional capital for our current business 
however  certain of these initiatives have resulted in significant charges recorded during and and we believe may also likely result in a decline in our retail revenues in compared to prior periods 
capital expenditures with the substantial completion of our prior build plans and due to the uncertainty of the extent and timing of future expansions of our networks  capital expenditures declined to million in compared to billion in with our intended deployment of a high capacity lte network primarily in densely populated urban areas  we anticipate that capital expenditures will increase in compared to at present  our best estimate based on currently available information  is that the capital expenditure cost of our planned lte overlay in the high tonnage areas of our g operating markets will be approximately to million in liquidity and capital resource requirements during the twelve months ended december   we incurred billion of net losses from continuing operations 
we utilized million of cash in operating activities of continuing operations and spent million of cash on capital expenditures in the improvement and maintenance of our networks 
we do not expect our operations to generate cumulative positive cash flows during the next twelve months 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments of approximately billion 
on december   we closed the equity offering  an underwritten public offering of million in shares of class a common stock 
the net proceeds from the equity offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
under the terms of the commitment agreement  on december   sprint holdco  llc exercised its pre emptive rights to purchase approximately million in shares of class b common stock and a corresponding number of class b common units in clearwire communications in a transaction we refer to as the sprint equity purchase 
additionally  on january   we announced the completion of an offering by our operating subsidiary  clearwire communications  of million aggregate principal amount of first priority senior secured notes due at an issue price of 
under the november g mvno amendment  sprint will pay us million for unlimited g mobile wimax services for resale to its retail subscribers in and  approximately two thirds of which is payable for service provided in  and the remainder for service provided in of the million  million will be paid as an offset to principal and interest due under a million dollar promissory note issued by us to sprint 
we will also receive million in prepayments from sprint in  which will be applied against usage based revenue  re wholesaling revenue in and and usage based revenue in and thereafter 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued as of december   we believe that we had sufficient cash to fund the near term liquidity needs of our business for the next months based on the cash and short term investments we had on hand as of the end of the quarter  the expected impact of our recent expense reductions  and the cash we expect to receive for our mobile wimax services from our retail business and from sprint under the november g mvno amendment 
if our business fails to perform as we expect or if we incur unforeseen expenses  we may be required to raise additional capital in the near term to fund our current business  including the deployment of our lte network 
also  we believe we may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our business and meet our financial obligations beyond the next months 
the amount of additional capital we will need over the long term  and the timing of our capital needs  will depend on a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and subject to a number of uncertainties 
the primary factors determining the amount of additional capital we will require include the amount of wholesale revenues we receive from our existing wholesale partners  our ability to obtain new wholesale partners and generate significant revenues from such partners  the timing of deployment of our lte network which will depend on our vendors ability to meet our planned timelines  the costs we incur in deploying our lte network which could be substantially higher than we currently expect if we are unable to secure equipment or services from vendors on the terms we expect or if we encounter other unexpected problems with our vendors or with the deployment  the amount of cash generated by our retail business  our ability to maintain reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures and the accuracy of our other projections of future financial performance 
the amount and timing of additional financings  if any  to satisfy our long term capital needs are difficult to estimate at this time 
we could pursue a number of alternatives for securing additional capital 
we may seek additional equity and debt financing from a number of potential sources  including new and existing strategic investors  private or public offerings and vendors 
with the recent trading price of our class a common stock  any additional equity financings would be extremely dilutive to our stockholders  while any additional debt financings could increase our future financial commitments  including aggregate interest payments on our existing and new indebtedness  to levels that we find unsustainable 
further  with our recently completed debt financing  we have maximized the amount of secured indebtedness we may incur under our existing indentures  which may make additional debt financings more difficult to obtain on acceptable terms  or at all 
other sources of additional capital could include  among other things  a sale of certain of our assets  such as excess spectrum  that we believe are not essential for our business 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to meet our long term capital needs  or we fail to sell a sufficient amount of additional services to sprint and new wholesale partners over the long term  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected  and we will be forced to consider all available alternatives 
business segments operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  which we refer to as the codm  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
we define the codm as our chief executive officer 
as our business continues to mature  we assess how we view and operate our business 
we market a service that is basically the same service across the united states and as such we operate as a single reportable segment as a provider of wireless broadband services in the united states 
prior to june   we had two reportable segments the united states and the international operations 
as a result of a strategic decision to focus investment in the united states market  during the second quarter of  we committed to sell our operations in belgium  germany and spain  which principally represent our remaining international operations 
as such  substantially all of the international operations assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to long lived assets and intangible assets  including spectrum  derivatives  operating leases and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued our accounting policies require management to make complex and subjective judgments 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  or information provided by outside sources  as appropriate 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial statements  the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements spectrum licenses we have three types of arrangements for spectrum licenses owned spectrum licenses with indefinite lives  owned spectrum licenses with definite lives and spectrum leases 
while owned spectrum licenses in the united states are issued for a fixed time  renewals of these licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost 
moreover  management has determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses and therefore  the licenses are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
changes in these factors may have a significant effect on our assessment of the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  consisting of spectrum licenses  at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of such asset or group of assets may be impaired 
our annual impairment testing is performed as of each october st and we perform a review of the existence of events or changes in circumstances related to the impairment of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on a quarterly basis 
factors we consider important  any of which could trigger an impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
we calculate the fair value of spectrum primarily using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach  which approximates value by assuming a company is started owning only the spectrum licenses  and then makes investments required to build a network utilizing the spectrum for its highest and best use 
we utilized a year discrete period to isolate cash flows attributable to the licenses including modeling the hypothetical build out of a nationwide network 
assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include  but are not limited to  revenue and subscriber growth rates  operating expenditures  capital expenditures and timing of build out  market share achieved  terminal value growth rate  tax rates and discount rate 
the assumptions which underlie the development of the network  subscriber base and other critical inputs of the discounted cash flow model were based on a combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical results and business plans to the extent we believe they are representative of those of a marketplace participant 
the discount rate used in the model represents a weighted average cost of capital taking into account the cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a target capital structure and the perceived risk associated with an intangible asset such as our spectrum licenses 
the terminal value growth rate represents our estimate of the marketplace s long term growth rate 
we also considered the market indications related to completed spectrum auctions and transactions 
giving consideration to when the transactions occurred and the similarities between the spectrum sold in those transactions to our spectrum licenses  we weighted the fair value indications with those obtained from application of the greenfield approach 
we also validate the fair value obtained from the greenfield approach against market data of pending transactions  when available 
we had no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets in the united states in any of the periods presented as the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets computed using the methodology described above was in excess of its carrying value 
holding all other assumptions constant  while the following changes in assumptions would result in the fair value of the licenses that is less than currently projected  the fair value would still be higher than their book values if the projected operating 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued cost or capital expenditures were to increase by as a percentage of revenue  if buildout to the target population coverage was delayed by one year  or the discount rate was increased by basis points 
however  if there is a substantial adverse decline in the operating profitability of the wireless service industry  we could have material impairment charges in future years which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairments of long lived assets we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment  which we refer to as pp e  and intangible assets with definite useful lives  which consists primarily of favorable spectrum leases and subscriber relationships  for recoverability whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projections of continuing losses associated with use of the asset  a significant change in our business or technology strategy  a significant change in our management s views of growth rates for our business  and a significant change in the anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
we evaluate quarterly  or as needed  whether such events and circumstances have occurred 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
when such events or circumstances exist  we determine the recoverability of the assets carrying value by estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the assets 
recoverability analyses  when performed  are based on probability weighted forecasted cash flows that consider our business and technology strategy  management s views of growth rates for the business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value 
our long lived assets  consisting of pp e and definite lived intangible assets such as subscriber relationships and our spectrum licenses in the united states  are combined into a single asset group for purposes of testing impairment because management believes that utilizing these assets as a group represents the highest and best use of the assets and is consistent with the management s strategy of utilizing our spectrum licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide network 
property  plant equipment a significant portion of our total assets is pp e 
pp e represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives 
the estimated useful life of equipment is determined based on historical usage of identical or similar equipment  with consideration given to technological changes and industry trends that could impact the network architecture and asset utilization 
since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we periodically review these factors to assess the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
during the year  as a result of our intent to deploy lte and sprint s announcement that it plans to deploy its own lte network  we evaluated the remaining useful lives of our network equipment 
we concluded that  because wimax related network assets are expected to continue to be in service supporting our retail customers and  pursuant to the november g mvno amendment  we committed to continue operating 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued our mobile wimax network through calendar year  no change to the remaining useful lives was appropriate at this time 
we will continue to monitor the estimated useful lives of our network equipment as our plans continue to evolve 
we capitalize certain direct costs  including certain salary and benefit costs and overhead costs  incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use 
we also capitalize interest associated with certain acquisition or construction costs of network related assets 
capitalized interest and direct costs are reported as part of the cost of the network related assets and as a reduction in the related expense in the statement of operations 
we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our networks  including network equipment and cell site development costs 
this assessment includes the write off of network equipment for estimated shrinkage experienced during the deployment process and the write down of network equipment and cell site development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to conclude that such assets are no longer needed to meet our strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
with the substantial completion of our prior build plans and due to the uncertainty of the extent and timing of future expansion of our networks  we review all network projects in process on a quarterly basis 
any network projects in process that no longer fit within management s strategic network plans are abandoned and the related costs written down 
as we continue to revise our build plans in response to changes in our strategy  funding availability  technology and industry trends  additional projects could be identified for abandonment  for which the associated write downs could be material 
derivative valuation derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance and are remeasured to fair value on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instruments are exercised or expire  with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as gain loss on derivative instruments 
at december   derivative financial instruments requiring revaluation are composed primarily of the exchange options  which we refer to as exchange options  embedded in our exchangeable notes issued in december that were required to be accounted for separately from the debt host contract 
valuation of the exchange options requires assumptions involving judgment as they are embedded derivatives within host contracts and consequently are not traded on an exchange 
we estimate the fair value using a trinomial option pricing model based on the individual characteristics of the exchange feature  observable market based inputs for stock price and risk free interest rate  and an assumption for volatility 
estimated volatility is a measure of risk or variability of our stock price over the life of the option 
the estimated volatility is based on our historical stock price volatility giving consideration to our estimates of market participant adjustments for the general conditions of the market as well as company specific factors such as our market trading volume and the expected future performance of the company 
our stock s volatility is an input assumption requiring significant judgment 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of in our estimated stock volatility could result in a loss of million  or a gain of million  respectively 
in addition  in the event of an issuance of new equity securities or securities exchangeable or convertible into capital stock  which we refer to as new securities  the pre emptive rights contained in the equityholders agreement allow certain equityholders to purchase their pro rata share of the new securities at the issuance price less any underwriting discounts 
this right is considered a derivative that is required to be recorded at fair value 
the fair value of this derivative is determined by  among other things  the probability of a new securities issuance  the probability that existing equityholders will participate in any new issuance and the extent of their participation  if any 
operating leases we periodically review our tower leases to determine whether they still fit within our network build plans 
for tower leases that are not utilized and no longer fit within our plans  we will terminate them  or when early termination is not available under the terms of the lease  we advise our landlords of our intention not to renew 
at the time we notify our landlords of our intention not to renew  we recognize a cease to use tower lease liability based on the remaining lease rentals adjusted for any prepaid or deferred rent recognized under the lease  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
estimating the cost of exiting certain leases involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location  the impact of any contractual sublease restrictions on the number of leases that will eventually be subleased and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued differs from that used in the initial estimate 
if our estimate of the number of leases that will eventually be subleased increased by  the accrual would decrease by million 
however  an adverse change in the assumptions could only increase the accrual by the amount of sublease rentals assumed in computing the accrual at december  of million 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
deferred tax asset valuations require significant management judgment in making such determination 
in doing so  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our limited operating history  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income loss  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued revenues retail revenues are primarily generated from subscription and modem lease fees for our g and pre g services  as well as from sales of g devices and fees for other services such as email and voip 
wholesale revenues are primarily generated from usage based service fees for our g services 
year ended december  percentage change versus percentage change versus in thousands  except percentages population covered by services subscribers retail wholesale n m the million increase in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is due primarily to growth in subscribers resulting from the continued expansion of our retail and wholesale subscriber base as we expanded our networks into new markets throughout and as further discussed below  during we curtailed our sales and advertising activities 
as a result  and as we currently do not expect to expand into additional markets  we expect retail revenues to decline in 
sprint is a significant wholesale customer of our g wireless broadband services 
on april   we signed an amendment to the g mvno agreement with sprint  which we refer to as the april g mvno agreement  that resulted in a new usage based pricing structure that applies to most g wireless services provided by us to sprint effective beginning january  application of the new usage based pricing structure to usage generated during as well as the increase in the number of wholesale subscribers contributed to the increase in wholesale revenues in that period as compared to the same period in the prior year 
in addition  wholesale revenue for the year ended december  also includes million of a million settlement payment 
because each of the agreements in the april g mvno agreement were explicitly linked to one another  the settlement amount was treated as partial consideration for a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables and was allocated to separate units of accounting based on the deliverables relative fair values 
the settlement payment was allocated  in part  to the settlement of pricing disputes 
the remainder was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreements 
the amount recognized in the year ended december  represents the portion allocated to the settlement of pricing disputes and the current amortization of the portion deferred 
during the year ended december   wholesale revenue recorded attributable to sprint comprised approximately of total revenues and substantially all of our wholesale revenues 
the million increase in revenues for compared to is due primarily to the continued expansion of our retail and wholesale subscriber base as we expanded our networks into new markets 
as of december   approximately of our wholesale subscribers consisted of subscribers on multi mode g g devices that resided outside of our currently launched g markets  but for whom we received an insignificant amount of revenue 
wholesale revenue in was based upon minimal wholesale rate and usage assumptions due to unresolved issues around pricing for wholesale transactions with sprint  which were resolved with the april g mvno agreement 
under the november g mvno amendments  sprint will pay us million for unlimited g mobile wimax services for resale to its retail subscribers in and  approximately two thirds of which is payable for service provided in  and the remainder for service provided in of the million  million will be paid as an offset to principal and interest due under a million promissory note issued by us to sprint 
of the amount due  million will be recognized on a straight line basis over and and the remaining million will be recorded as an offset to the interest cost associated with the promissory note 
due to the significance of wholesale revenue from sprint to total revenues for the year ended december  and the impact of changing from usage based pricing to fixed pricing agreed to in the november g mvno amendment  we currently expect wholesale revenues to decline in compared to therefore  in order to grow our revenues beyond those agreed to in the november g mvno amendment  we are focusing our efforts on deploying our lte network and leveraging that network to add new wholesale partners 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued cost of goods and services and network costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of goods and services and network costs primarily includes tower and network costs  provision of excessive and obsolete equipment  cost of goods sold and cost of services 
tower costs including rents  utilities  and backhaul  which is the transporting of data traffic between distributed sites and a central point in the market or point of presence  which we refer to as pop 
network costs primarily consist of network repair and maintenance costs  rent for pop facilities and costs to transport data traffic between pop sites 
cost of goods sold include the cost of cpe sold to subscribers  and cost of services include costs incurred to provide g wireless services to our dual mode customers 
the change in cost of goods and services and network costs during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in tower and network costs and an increase in the provision for excessive and obsolete equipment 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in tower and networks costs  compared to million in the prior year 
tower and network costs during the year ended december  include million of charges related to lease termination costs and recognition of cease to use liabilities for unused backhaul circuits and tower leases where we have provided notice to our landlords of our intention not to renew 
the remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of tower leases and an increase in related backhaul and network expenses resulting from the operation of our network  which was significantly expanded in the second half of the provision for excessive and obsolete equipment was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year driven primarily by the uncertainty around the extent and timing of future expansion of the network  as well as our intent to deploy lte in areas with expected high usage concentration and the write down of obsolete cpe 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in tower and network costs  compared to approximately million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of tower leases and an increase in related backhaul and network expenses resulting from our network expansion activities and the launch of new g markets during during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in charges related to obsolete cpe  write offs of identified differences between recorded amounts and the results of physical counts of network base station equipment and an increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete equipment 
shrinkage of network base station equipment primarily represents losses experienced during the deployment process  while the reserves for excess and obsolete equipment represents the costs of equipment that exceeds our current needs  or is no longer being deployed in the networks due to obsolescence 
write offs of cpe primarily represent leased modems not expected to be recovered from former subscribers 
during  we incurred approximately million due to write offs of cpe  identified differences between recorded amounts and the results of physical counts of network base station equipment and an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete equipment 
in  we expect costs of goods sold to increase as we discontinue the option for our new retail customers to lease equipment in favor of a purchase only model 
we expect tower and network costs for  excluding the impact of charges related to recognition of cease to use liabilities  if any  to remain consistent with the level of costs incurred in the current year as we continue to operate our existing networks 
with the deployment of our lte network  we expect network costs to increase 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative  which we refer to as sg a  expenses include all of the following costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs  facilities costs  third party professional service fees  customer care  sales commissions  bad debt expense  property and other operating taxes  and administrative support activities  including executive  finance and accounting  it  legal  human resources  treasury and other shared services 
the decrease in sg a expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the curtailment of advertising expenses due to our cost containment efforts  which led to slower growth in retail sales activity  resulting in lower commission expense and reductions in our sales and marketing workforce due to our outsourcing arrangements with teletech 
marketing and advertising costs decreased million  or  in from  commissions costs decreased million  or and sales and marketing related employee costs decreased million  or  in 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued compared to primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing headcount at december  compared to the same date in the increase in sg a expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses as well as additional resources  headcount and shared services that we utilized as we launched our g mobile broadband services in additional markets in marketing and advertising costs increased million  or  in from due to the increase in gross subscriber additions and costs incurred in support of the launch of new g markets during employee related costs increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in headcount during the year 
our average employee headcount increased approximately for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  while we expect total sg a expense to decrease in as compared to as we experience the effects of our cost containment measures  as well as the workforce reductions that commenced in november and continued in  we expect expenses to increase during the first half of as we incur advertising costs to continue to support the launch of our new no contract product offering 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents depreciation recorded on pp e and amortization of intangible assets 
the increase during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and the increase during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in are primarily a result of new network assets placed into service to support our launched markets during and  respectively 
we expect depreciation and amortization in to increase slightly as compared with depreciation and amortization as we placed minimal new assets into service during during the year  as a result of our intent to deploy lte and sprint s announcement that it plans to deploy its own lte network  we evaluated the remaining useful lives of our network equipment 
we concluded that  because wimax related network assets are expected to continue to be in service supporting our retail customers and  pursuant to the november g mvno amendment  we committed to continue operating our mobile wimax network through calendar year  no change to the remaining useful lives was appropriate at this time 
we will continue to monitor the estimated useful lives of our network equipment as our plans continue to evolve

loss from abandonment of network and other assets during  we invested heavily in building  deploying and augmenting our network 
with the substantial completion of 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued our prior build plans in and due to the uncertainty of the extent and timing of future expansion of the network  as well as our intent to deploy lte subject to funding  alongside mobile wimax  in areas of expected high usage concentration  we decided to abandon certain projects that no longer fit within management s strategic network plans 
for projects that were abandoned  the related costs were written down  resulting in a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  during the same periods in and  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  for the abandonment of network projects that no longer met management s strategic network plans 
additionally  in connection with our cost savings initiatives  during we identified  evaluated and terminated certain unutilized tower leases  or when early termination was not available under the terms of the lease  we advised our landlords of our intention not to renew 
the costs for projects classified as construction in progress related to leases for which we have initiated such termination actions were written down  resulting in a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  in addition  during the second quarter of  we completed an assessment of certain internally developed software projects that had not yet been placed in service 
those projects are no longer expected to be completed  and were thus written down to fair value  resulting in a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  as we continue to revise our business plans in response to changes in our strategy  our commitment under the november g mvno amendment and funding availability  additional assets could be identified for abandonment  for which there could be associated write downs

in addition  the amount of interest capitalized during the period declined significantly due to the substantial completion of our wimax network build in 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued the increase in interest expense and interest payments for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due primarily to a full year of interest expense incurred related to the issuance of senior secured notes in november which increased the outstanding principal balance by approximately billion  partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized during the period as our network build activity accelerated during as a result of the issuance of an additional million of senior secured notes in january  we expect interest cost to increase in relative to gain loss on derivative instruments in connection with the issuance of the exchangeable notes in december  we recognized derivative liabilities relating to the exchange options embedded in those notes 
the change in estimated fair value of the exchange options is required to be recognized in earnings during the period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million for the change in estimated fair value of the exchange options 
in addition  in the event of an issuance of new equity securities or securities exchangeable or convertible into capital stock  which we refer to as new securities  certain existing equityholders are entitled to pre emptive rights which allow them to purchase their pro rata share of the new securities at the issuance price less any underwriting discounts 
this right is considered a derivative that is required to be recorded at fair value and we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december  representing the value of the derivative upon completion of the sprint equity purchase 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million for the change in estimated fair value of the exchange options 
these instruments were not outstanding during the million loss recorded during the year ended december  was related to interest rate swap contracts which were used as economic hedges of the interest rate risk related to a portion of our senior term loan facility 
we terminated these swap contracts during the fourth quarter of in connection with the retirement of our senior term loan facility 
we expect the gain loss on derivative instruments to fluctuate significantly in due to the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of the exchange options to valuation inputs such as stock price and volatility

income tax provision the increase in the income tax provision for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due to deferred tax expense recorded to reflect the effect of the limitation on our net operating losses  which we refer to as nols  under section of the internal revenue code due to the equity offering on december  and the increased deferred tax liability associated with the gain on derivative instruments recorded for the year ended december  the limitation of our nols caused an increase to the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset of our continuing operations  resulting in an increase in the net deferred liability for our continuing operations 
as a result of our plans to sell our operations in spain  belgium and germany  we believe that if certain intercompany loans related to our international operations were considered uncollectible for federal income tax purposes  there would be an increase to the deferred tax liability of our discontinued operations of up to approximately million along with a corresponding deferred tax expense for our discontinued operations 
the increase in the income tax provision for as compared to is primarily due to an increase in taxes at the state level as we expanded our services into new markets throughout net loss from discontinued operations attributable to clearwire corporation the net loss from discontinued operations attributable to clearwire corporation represents our portion of the total net loss from discontinued operations 
the increase in net loss from discontinued operations attributable to clearwire corporation for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due primarily to clearwire corporation s share of impairment charges recorded to assets held by our international subsidiaries and charges to adjust the carrying value of the disposal 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries continued group to their fair value less cost to sell 
clearwire corporation s share of these charges  which was included as discontinued operations  was approximately million for the year ended december  total net loss from discontinued operations for was million as compared to million for this increase was due primarily to impairment charges of million related to our indefinite lived spectrum assets  network assets and other intangible assets in our international operations 
the average percentage ownership by the non controlling interest for increased by approximately as compared to resulting in a lower portion of the net losses being allocated to clearwire corporation

in addition  during the year ended december   we received a total of million from sprint pursuant to the april g mvno amendment comprised of million relating to the minimum commitment provided in the april g mvno amendment  million in prepayment for future services beyond the minimum commitment and million payment to settle outstanding disputes related to prior usage 
the higher collections were partially offset by an increase of million in payments for interest on long term debt obligations and an increase in operating expenses due to our overall network growth throughout net cash used in operating activities increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to payments for operating expense as we continued to expand and operate our business 
the increased operating expense payments were partially offset by an increase in cash collections from subscribers of approximately year over year 
investing activities during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million as compared to the same period in this change is due primarily to a decrease of approximately billion in cash paid for pp e which was partially offset by a billion reduction in net maturities  year over year  of available for sale securities which are invested in short term investments consisting principally of united states government and agency issues 
during  our focus was on the build out of our g mobile broadband network  while during our focus has been on maintenance and operational performance of the networks

these are partially offset by payments of billion on our senior term loan facility  which was retired on november  our payment obligations under the senior secured notes  rollover notes and second priority notes are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries on a senior basis and secured by certain assets of such subsidiaries on a first priority lien 
the senior secured notes  rollover notes and second priority notes contain limitations on our activities  which among other things include incurring additional indebtedness and guaranteeing indebtedness  making distributions or payment of dividends or certain other restricted payments or investments  making certain payments on indebtedness  entering into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries  selling or otherwise disposing of assets  merger  consolidation or sales of substantially all of our assets  entering transactions with affiliates  creating liens  issuing certain preferred stock or similar equity securities and making investments and acquiring assets 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations of our continuing operations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future cash payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of december  changes in our business needs or interest rates  as well as actions by third parties and other factors  may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual cash payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table

purchase agreements includes purchase commitments with take or pay obligations and or volume commitments for equipment that are non cancelable and minimum purchases we have committed to purchase from suppliers over time for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include  among other things  agreements for backhaul  subscriber devices and it related and other services 
the amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher than the minimum commitments due to variable components of these agreements

total future interest payments of million are due on a pro rata basis  paid bi annually through december  in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the actual delivery and acceptance of products or services 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amount that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes blanket purchase order amounts where the orders are subject to cancellation or termination at our discretion or where the quantity of goods and services to be purchased or the payment terms are unknown because such purchase orders are not firm commitments 
we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued new accounting guidance amending fair value measurement to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  which we refer to as ifrs 
the new guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap but does expand existing disclosure requirements and make other amendments such as clarification regarding application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  application of blockage factors and other premiums and discounts  and measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio and instruments classified within shareholders equity 
disclosure requirements have been enhanced with the most significant change requiring entities to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in a recurring level fair value measurement  a description of the valuation processes used and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements 
in addition  entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed 
the new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
as the new accounting guidance will primarily amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurement  we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
instead  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
full retrospective application is required 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income which deferred the effective date for the provisions pertaining to reclassification adjustments 
as the new accounting guidance will only amend the presentation requirements of other comprehensive income  we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  our stock price risk  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments due to credit risk 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our variable rate vendor financing notes 
an increase in month libor  would increase our interest expense and change cashflows on our variable rate vendor financing notes 
at december   we had million aggregate principal outstanding of variable rate vendor financing notes whose interest rate resets quarterly based on the month libor rate 
a increase in the month libor rate would increase interest expense over the next twelve month period by approximately  we have long term fixed rate debt with a book value of billion and million of long term fixed rate capital lease obligations outstanding at december  while changes in interest rates or our credit spread impact the fair value of this fixed rate debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows as the rate paid does not change if interest rates or credit spreads change 
we expect to hold the debt to maturity or  in the case of the exchangeable notes  to december  unless market and other factors are favorable 
the exchangeable notes  with a carrying value of million at december   have a maturity of  however  it is likely the notes would be held no longer than december   the date that we have the option to redeem the exchangeable notes at par and the noteholders may require us to repurchase the exchangeable notes at par 
we also have cash equivalents and investments that may expose us to interest rate risk 
a decline in interest rates decreases interest earned from our investments 
our cash equivalents and investment portfolio have a weighted average maturity of month and a market yield of as of december  due to the current market yield  a further decline in interest rates would have a de minimis impact on earnings 
stock price risk the exchange options embedded in the exchangeable notes constitute derivative liabilities that are required to be separately accounted for from the debt host instrument at fair value 
input assumptions used to model the estimated fair value of the exchange options include our stock price  our stock s volatility and carrying costs 
the value of the exchange options are sensitive to both the price of our class a common stock and volatility of our stock 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of on our stock price could result in a loss of million or a gain of million  respectively 
our stock s volatility is an input assumption requiring significant judgment 
holding all other pricing assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of in our estimated stock volatility could result in a loss of million or a gain of million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to our international operations 
we currently do not hedge our currency exchange rate risk and  as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
our international subsidiaries and equity investees generally use the currency of the jurisdiction in which they reside  or local currency  as their functional currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the reporting period 
the effects of changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains losses and recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
credit risk at december   we held available for sale short term investments with a fair value and carrying value of million and a cost of million  comprised of united states government securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our short term and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such 
table of contents assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
the majority of our short term investments at december  were concentrated in united states treasury securities which are considered the least risky investments available to united states investors
