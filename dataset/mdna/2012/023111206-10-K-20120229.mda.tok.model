when used in this report  the words may  would  should  could  expects  aims  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology are included to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include but are not limited to statements regarding the potential for  and timing of  approval of the amr new drug application by the united states food and drug administration and the next steps we may take thereto  the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  the goals of our development activities  the scope of our intellectual property protection  estimates of the potential markets for our product candidates  estimates of the capacity of manufacturing and other facilities to support our products  our operating and growth strategies  our industry  our projected cash needs  liquidity and capital resources and our expected future revenues  operations and expenditures 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements 
you should review carefully the factors identified in this report in item a  risk factors 
we disclaim any intent to update or announce revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect actual events or developments  except as required by law 
except as otherwise indicated herein  all dates referred to in this report represent periods or dates fixed with reference to our fiscal year ended december overview we are a late stage biopharmaceutical company with expertise in lipid science focused on the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
our lead product candidate is amr  an ultra pure omega fatty acid  comprising not less than ultra pure icosapent ethyl  or ethyl epa 
we are developing amr for the treatment of patients with very high triglyceride levels and high triglyceride levels  or hypertriglyceridemia 
triglycerides are fats in the blood 
in september  we filed a new drug application  or nda  with the us food and drug administration  or fda  seeking marketing approval for the use of amr in the treatment of patients with very high triglyceride levels mg dl  or what we refer to as the marine indication 
the fda has assigned a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date of july  for the completion of its review of this nda 
the nda for the marine indication is supported by a special protocol assessment  or spa  agreement with the fda 
we plan to separately seek approval for amr for the treatment of patients with high triglyceride levels and mg dl who are also on statin therapy for elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol  or ldl c  levels which we refer to as mixed dyslipidemia  or what we refer to as the anchor indication 
the anchor indication is also supported by a spa agreement with the fda 
the potential efficacy and safety of amr was studied in two phase clinical trials  the marine trial and the anchor trial 
these trials showed favorable clinical results in their respective patient populations in reducing triglyceride levels without a statistically significant increase in ldl c levels  and in the gram amr anchor results  with a statistically significant decrease in ldl c levels 
these trials also showed favorable results  particularly with the gram dose of amr  in other important lipid and inflammation biomarkers  including apo b apolipoprotein b  non high density lipoprotein cholesterol  or hdl c  total cholesterol  very low density lipoprotein cholesterol  or vldl c  lp pla lipoprotein associated phospholipase  and hs crp high sensitivity c reactive protein 
in each of these trials  amr exhibited a safety profile comparable to placebo 
in november  we announced the favorable results of the phase marine trial  and in april we announced the favorable results of the phase anchor trial 
the results of both of these studies were submitted to the fda as part of the nda for the marine indication 
to obtain fda approval of amr for the anchor indication  based on communications with the fda  we believe that we must first obtain approval 
table of contents of amr in the marine indication and be substantially underway with a cardiovascular outcomes study at the time of the submission of an nda to the fda for the anchor indication 
based upon feedback from the fda and consistent with the respective spas for the marine trial and anchor trial  we do not believe the final results of an outcomes study are required for fda approval of amr for either indication 
in december  we announced commencement of patient dosing in our cardiovascular outcomes study of amr  titled reduce it reduction of cardiovascular events with epa intervention trial  that is designed to evaluate the efficacy of amr in reducing major cardiovascular events in an at risk patient population on statin therapy 
the reduce it study is also the subject of an spa agreement with the fda 
if successful  we believe the results of this study could lead to a broadening of the market potential for amr beyond the marine and anchor indications 
hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream and has been recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiac disease 
we estimate that over million adults in the us have elevated triglyceride levels mg dl and approximately million people in the united states have very high triglyceride levels mg dl 
triglycerides provide important information as a marker associated with the risk for heart disease and stroke  especially when an individual also has low high density lipoprotein  or hdl c often referred to as good cholesterol  and elevated levels of ldl c often referred to as bad cholesterol 
manufacturing and supply we entered with one active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  supplier  nisshin pharma 
we believe this supplier is capable of producing api to support the initial commercial launch of amr however  based on the positive results of our marine and anchor clinical trials and the potential for greater than originally expected product demand  we determined in to add additional suppliers 
our goals in expanding our supply chain were to provide greater capacity to meet anticipated demand  enable supply diversification and flexibility and introduce cost competition 
after conducting an extensive global search for manufactures capable of producing amr api to our technical specifications  we entered into limited exclusivity  long term agreements with two additional api suppliers in we are currently working to finalize terms and conditions with a fourth supplier 
certain of our api supply agreements contain provisions under which the cost of supply to us decreases as we purchase increased product volume 
the agreements with each of our api suppliers contemplate phased capacity expansion aimed at creating sufficient capacity to meet anticipated demand for api material for amr following fda approval 
accordingly  nisshin and our other potential suppliers are currently working to expand and qualify their production capabilities to meet regulatory requirements to manufacture the api for amr these api suppliers are self funding these expansion and qualification plans with contributions from amarin 
there can be no assurance that additional suppliers will fully fund the capital costs of our engagement or that they will successfully qualify with the fda 
our nda for amr references supply from nisshin with which we have had the longest relationship and is best qualified to support our launch of amr we have defined with the fda our plan and specifications for qualifying the additional api suppliers 
we intend to submit sndas for the use of these additional api suppliers after the suppliers successfully complete the qualification process and the nda is approved 
for api encapsulation  we submitted two commercial encapsulators as part of our nda 
we believe that both of these companies have the capacity to support our product launch requirements 
during  we intend to increase our purchases of api and finished capsules of amr in preparation of commercial launch 
we plan to make certain of these purchases prior to nda approval with the aim to further expand purchase levels of supply after nda approval 
we may elect to make api purchases from certain of our suppliers after we are satisfied that the material they produce and their facilities are qualified 
however  in the event that we make such purchases  we will not be able to use such material for commercial sale until the snda for the applicable supplier is approved by the fda 
similarly  if we are not compliant with other regulations with regard to this intended purchase of supply  our launch may be delayed 

table of contents commercialization strategy we are currently considering three potential paths for the marketing and sale of amr strategic collaboration  acquisition and self commercialization  that latter of which could include a third party collaboration 
from time to time we have held discussions with larger pharmaceutical companies on potential collaborations and other strategic opportunities with larger pharmaceutical companies and we may have discussions regarding such opportunities in the future 
these strategic opportunities may include licensing or similar transactions  joint ventures  partnerships  strategic alliances  business associations  or a sale of the company 
however  we cannot estimate the timing of such potential collaborations 
no assurance can be given that we will enter into any such strategic transaction 
until such time when we enter into such a strategic transaction  if ever  we plan to continue to execute on our plans to launch  market and sell amr on our own 
the us market is currently our primary focus for the initial commercial launch of amr opportunities to market and sell amr outside of the united states are also under evaluation 
january financing and financial position on january   amarin  through its wholly owned subsidiary corsicanto limited  a private limited company incorporated under the laws of ireland  completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of its exchangeable senior notes due the notes are the senior unsecured obligations of corsicanto and are guaranteed by amarin corporation plc 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning on july  the notes mature on january   unless earlier repurchased  redeemed or exchanged 
on or after january   we may elect to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on each of january   january  and january   the holders of the notes may require that we repurchase in cash the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
at any time prior to january   upon certain circumstances  which circumstances include our issuing a notice of redemption to the note holders  the price of amarin shares trading above of the exchange price  or certain other events defined in the note agreement  the holders of the notes may elect to convert the notes 
the exchange rate for conversion is adss per  principal amount of the notes equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately per ads  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  including adjustment if we pay cash dividends 
upon exchange  the notes may be settled  at amarin s election  subject to certain conditions  in cash  adss or a combination of cash and adss 
the proceeds received by amarin from the january debt offering were approximately million  net of estimated fees and transaction costs 
together with our cash balance of million at december   we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our projected operations at least for the next twelve months  including advancement of the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study and preparations for and commercial launch of amr on each of the three potential paths we are considering for commercialization  subject to regulatory approval 
unless we enter into a strategic collaboration in support of a commercial launch  we may need to raise additional capital to support these efforts on our own 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to derivative financial liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and 
table of contents liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial liabilities derivative financial liabilities on initial recognition are recorded at fair value 
they are subsequently held at fair value  with gains and losses arising for changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of derivative financial liabilities is determined using valuation techniques  typically we use the black scholes option pricing model  or a monte carlo simulation depending on the nature of the instrument 
we use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date 
fluctuations in the assumptions used in the valuation model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if we issue shares to discharge the liability  the derivative financial liability is derecognized and common stock and additional paid in capital are recognized on the issuance of those shares 
for options and warrants treated as derivative financial liabilities  at settlement date the carrying value of the options and warrants are transferred to equity 
the cash proceeds received from shareholders for additional shares are recorded in common stock and additional paid in capital 
inventory capitalization until amr is approved for commercial marketing and sale  it is considered a product candidate under development 
as such  until an nda for amr is approved  all supply of amr purchased will not be capitalized and will be included as a component of research and development expense 
upon nda approval  we plan to capitalize subsequent amr purchases as inventory 
purchases of amr received and expensed before nda approval will not be subsequently capitalized 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation on operations has been minimal during the past three years 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  versus december  revenue 
we recorded no revenue in or research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  a decrease of million  or 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below research and development expenses non cash stock based compensation expense research and development expense  excluding non cash charges  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to decreased costs in for our 
table of contents amr cardiovascular program  primarily costs associated with the marine and anchor trials  our two phase clinical trials  the top line results of which were reported in december and april  respectively 
the decrease in costs for these trials in versus were partially offset by increased clinical costs for the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study  which was initiated in the second half of  and costs associated with submitting our nda in september for amr stock based compensation expense included within research and development was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although clinical costs for the marine and anchor trials have decreased as a result of their completion in  we expect these cost reductions to be offset in by costs for the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study as part of which dosing of initial patients commenced in december we currently estimate that cumulative costs incurred through a cro for reduce it will approximate million in and million through the estimated six year term of the study 
we also anticipate increases in research and development costs during related to the purchase of supply of amr  which supply we intend to include as a component of research and development expense for accounting purposes prior to nda approval 
the amount of expense we incur for amr supply during depends upon the timing of receipt of api from our suppliers and the timing of an nda approval 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below general and administrative expenses non cash warrant related compensation income expense non cash stock based compensation expense restructuring  severance and lease exit costs general and administrative expense  excluding restructuring  severance and non cash compensation charges for stock compensation and warrants  for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to higher staffing levels in  increased overhead costs for increased office space and higher costs in for marketing studies and other pre commercial activities 
warrant related compensation income expense for the year ended december  was million of income  versus million of expense in the prior year  a change of million 
warrant related compensation income for the period ended december  reflects non cash income for the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability associated with warrants issued in october to three former officers of amarin  net of warrants exercised 
the income in was due primarily to the decrease in the fair value of these warrants  the decrease in the fair value of the warrants is due primarily to a decrease in our stock price between december  and december  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  versus million in the prior year period  an increase of million due primarily to an increase in option awards granted in late and during the year ended december  to attract and retain qualified employees 
restructuring  severance and lease exit costs for the year ended december  represented costs for severance  office consolidation and the relocation of certain operations to our us offices 
we expect general and administrative costs in to increase as we prepare for the commercialization of amr  including costs for market research  sales force preparation and development of management information systems 
the extent of such increases will depend in large part on the timing of nda approval for amr and whether we launch amr on our own or with a strategic collaborator 
if we launch amr on our own  we anticipate that this launch will occur  subject to nda approval  in early and that we would not hire the majority of the anticipated number of sales representatives until the fourth quarter of 
table of contents loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability for the year ended december  was expense of million versus million in the prior year period 
loss gain on change in fair value of derivative liability is primarily related to the change in fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with the october private placement 
in october we issued million warrants at an exercise price of and recorded a million warrant derivative liability  representing the fair value of the warrants issued 
as these warrants have been classified as a derivative liability  they are revalued at each reporting period  with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  for these warrants 
the fair value of the warrant derivative liability at december  was million and we recognized a million loss on change in fair value of derivative liability for the period ended december  the decrease in the warrant derivative liability value was due primarily to the decrease in the price of our common shares

the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased costs in for our amr cardiovascular program  primarily costs associated with our two phase iii clinical trials incurred through medpace  the cro we engaged in late to help us set up and manage the two trials 
we began enrolling patients in these trials in early and announced the completion of enrollment in both trials during the second half of these clinical trial cost increases were partially offset by lower costs for non cardiovascular development programs which were discontinued during the fourth quarter of stock based compensation expense included within research and development was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash change in fair value of ester share based liability for the year ended december  reflects the change in the fair value from december  to the may settlement date of the liability associated with milestone ia of the ester share purchase agreement see further discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

interest income expense  net 
interest income includes interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  versus million in the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to the amortization of the difference between the fair value of the june and july bridge loans at their date of issue and their face value at the time of repayment in october the bridge notes were repaid in conjunction with our october private placement 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other income primarily includes gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions 
other income for the year ended december  also included million from the sale of intellectual property 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity as of december  include cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition  in january we completed a convertible debt offering from which we received approximately million in net proceeds 
our projected uses of cash include the continued funding of the reduce it study  commercial preparation and launch of amr  working capital and other general corporate activities 
our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in millions years ended december  cash used in provided by continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we had no debt obligations at december  on january   amarin  through its wholly owned subsidiary corsicanto limited  a private limited company incorporated under the laws of ireland  completed a private placement of in aggregate principal amount of its exchangeable senior notes due the proceeds received by amarin from the january debt offering were approximately million  net of fees and transaction costs

in january  we sold million shares of our common shares  par value per share  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and expenses payable by us associated with this transaction 
we believe that our cash  including the net proceeds from the january financing  will be sufficient to fund our projected operations for at least the next twelve months  including advancement of the reduce it cardiovascular outcomes study  commercial preparations and projected launch of amr  working capital and other general corporate activities 
this is based on our current operational plans and activities at normal levels and does not assume any cash inflows from partnerships  warrant exercises or other dilutive or non dilutive financings in the longer term 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total to to after contractual obligations purchase obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations represents minimum purchase obligations with nisshin  our supplier of amr active pharmaceutical ingredient  ethyl epa 
we purchased million of materials during the year ended december  and have additional purchase obligations of million in not included in this obligation is a non refundable milestone payment of million payable upon the first marketing approval of amr in the united states 
additional future minimum purchases will be required  subject to an nda approval  and in preparation for commercialization of amr we may purchase more than the minimum amount 
in addition  provided the supplier has expanded its manufacturing capacity in accordance with the agreement  the supplier may terminate the agreement in the event that i amarin does not receive marketing approval for amr in the united states on or before december  or ii in the event that amarin abandons development of amr for hypertriglyceridemia in the united states 
in either case  amarin will be required to reimburse the supplier for certain costs incurred by the supplier in connection with its manufacturing expansion  less the amount of profit received as a result of purchases of ethyl epa by amarin  not to exceed million 
we anticipate incurring certain costs associated with the qualification of product produced by nisshin 
in an effort to further expand production capacity at this supplier or through the addition of supplemental suppliers  we may make capital commitments to support their expansion  particularly if such commitments further reduce the cost to us of the manufactured product 
represents operating lease costs  primarily consisting of leases for facilities in dublin  ireland  bedminster  nj and groton  ct 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the above table also does not reflect potential material purchases under active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  supply agreements signed during with two additional api suppliers 
we are currently working to finalize terms and conditions with a fourth supplier 
these agreements provide access to additional api supply that is incremental to supply from nisshin  our existing api supplier 
each of these three api agreements contemplates a phased capacity expansion plan aimed at creating sufficient capacity to meet anticipated demand for api material for amr following fda approval 
these api suppliers are self funding these expansion plans with contributions from amarin 
these agreements include requirements for the suppliers to qualify their materials and facilities 
we anticipate incurring certain costs associated with the qualification of product produced by these suppliers 
following fda approval of amr  these agreements include annual purchase levels enabling amarin to maintain supply exclusivity with each respective supplier  and to prevent potential termination of the agreements 
because we have not yet obtained fda approval for amr  these amounts are excluded from the above table 
the supply agreements also include i development fees up to a maximum of million  ii material commitments of up to million for initial raw materials  which will be credited against future api purchases  and is refundable to amarin if a supplier does not successfully develop and qualify the api by a certain date and iii a raw material purchase commitment of million 

table of contents concurrent with one of these supply agreements  our agreement with chemport located in south korea  we agreed to make a minority share equity investment in chemport of up to million 
in july  we paid to chemport million under this agreement  which has been included in other long term assets at december  subject to chemport meeting certain milestones  we anticipate making the remaining million investment during under our share repurchase agreement with laxdale limited  in connection with commercialization of amr for cardiovascular indications  prior to the end of we are required to pay potential royalties to a former employee of laxdale of on net sales up to million approximately million at december   for net sales between million approximately million at december  and million approximately million at december   and for sales in excess of million approximately million at december  
after  we have no royalty obligations 
under this same agreement with laxdale limited  upon receipt of marketing approval in the us and or europe for the first indication for amr or first indication of any product containing amarin neuroscience intellectual property acquired from laxdale limited in  we must make an aggregate stock or cash payment at the sole option of each of the sellers of million approximately million at december  for each of the two potential marketing approvals ie  million maximum  or approximately million at december  
in addition  upon receipt of a marketing approval in the us or europe for a further indication of amr or further indication of any other product using amarin neuroscience intellectual property  we must make an aggregate stock or cash payment at the sole option of each of the sellers of million approximately million at december  for each of the two potential market approvals ie million maximum  or approximately million at december  
in addition to the obligations in the table above  we have approximately million of liability for uncertain tax positions that have been recorded in long term liabilities at december  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
shelf registration statement on march   we filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
 which provides for the offer  from time to time  of an indeterminate and unlimited amount of ordinary shares  which may be represented by american depositary shares  preference shares  which may be represented by american depositary shares  senior or subordinated debt securities  warrants to purchase any of these securities  and any combination of these securities  individually or as units 
in addition  if we identify any security holder s in a prospectus supplement  they may also offer identified securities under this registration statement although we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of securities by any of these selling security holders 
this universal shelf registration statement was automatically effective upon its filing 
the addition of any newly issued equity securities into the market may be dilutive to existing stockholders and new issuances by us or sales by our selling security holders could have an adverse effect on the price of our securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in credit worthiness and liquidity of our marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
at december   we record as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock issued to investors 
the fair value of this warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the 
table of contents market price of our common shares based on the market price of our stock at december  on which the december  valuation was based  the value of the derivative liability would have increased by million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability in our statement of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the euro and sterling 
the majority of our vendor relationships are denominated in us dollar 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk through market value fluctuations of balance sheet items ie  price risk or through changes in interest income or expenses ie  re financing or re investment risk 
interest rate risk mainly arises through interest bearing liabilities and assets 
we invest funds not needed for near term operating expenses in diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of december   the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents maturing in one year or less was million and represented of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our securities due to the general short term nature of our investment portfolio 
at december   and there was no outstanding debt
