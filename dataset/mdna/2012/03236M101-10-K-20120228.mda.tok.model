part i item business overview we are building an integrated renewable products company to provide sustainable alternatives to a broad range of petroleum sourced products used in specialty chemical and transportation fuel markets worldwide 
we do this by applying our industrial synthetic biology technology platform to modify microorganisms  primarily yeast  to function as living factories in established fermentation processes to convert plant sourced sugars into a variety of hydrocarbon molecules that can serve as flexible building blocks to be used in a wide range of products 
we intend to commercialize these products as renewable ingredients in six target markets cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers and plastic additives  home and personal care products  and transportation fuels 
we call these no compromise products because we design them to perform comparably to or better than currently available products 
our first technology success came through the development and application of our platform to create microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid  a precursor of artemisinin  an anti malarial therapeutic 
we granted a royalty free license to this technology to sanofi aventis  which currently expects to begin distributing artemisinin based anti malarial drugs made through our technology in our first proprietary commercialization efforts have been focused on a molecule called farnesene  or biofene  which can be used as is or can be further converted by conventional chemical process into other renewable ingredients in consumer and industrial products  as well as serve as transportation fuels such as diesel 
our strategy is to focus our direct commercialization efforts on higher value  lower volume markets while moving lower margin  higher volume commodity products  including our fuels and base oil lubricants products  into joint venture arrangements with established industry leaders 
we believe this approach will permit access to the capital and resources necessary to support large scale production and global distribution for our large market commodity products 
to support this strategy  we have established a number of relationships  including development and commercialization agreements with an affiliate of total sa  or total  which currently provides funding for our biofene research program as well as the research and development of our jet and diesel fuels 
under these agreements  we intend to establish one or more joint ventures with total to commercialize these products 
a supply agreement with petrobras distribuidora sa  or petrobras  under which we sell diesel produced from biofene to petrobras who blends our diesel in fuel sold to city bus fleets in s o paulo and rio de janeiro  brazil 
a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of cosan ind stria e com rcio sa  or cosan  a leading producer of lubricants in brazil  which established novvi llc  or novvi  for the purpose of developing and commercializing base oils for use in finished lubricants products 
development and commercialization agreements with firmenich sa  or firmenich  and givaudan schweiz ag  or givaudan  global flavors and fragrances companies  focusing on key ingredients for the flavors and fragrances market 
a development agreement with manufacture francaise de pneumatiques michelin  or michelin  focusing on development and commercialization of isoprene for use in tires 
agreements with several entities for the development of biofene for various industrial polymer or home and personal care applications  including i kuraray co  ltd  or kuraray  for the use of biofene in certain polymer products  ii m g finanziaria srl  or m g  for use of biofene in m g s polyethylene terephthalate pet resins incorporated into containers for food  beverages and other products  iii method products  inc  or method  for the use of biofene in home and personal care products  iv the proctor gamble company  or p g  for the use of biofene as an ingredient in certain household products  and v wilmar trading pte 
ltd  or wilmar  for the use of biofene as a surfactant 
to support our manufacturing operations  we have established the following relationships for the production of biofene  contract manufacturing agreements with i biomin do brasil nutric o animal ltda  or biomin  related to the use of a facility located in piracicaba  brazil  ii antibi ticos  sa  or antibi ticos  for a production facility located in le n  spain  and iii tate lyle ingredients americas  inc  or tate lyle  an affiliate of tate lyle plc in decatur  il  to produce biofene 
for the conversion of biofene into finished chemical products  agreements with i glycotech  inc  or glycotech  related to the conversion of biofene into squalane a moisturizing ingredient used in cosmetics and other personal care products  industrial lubricants and other final products at a facility located in leland  north carolina  ii dottikon exclusive synthesis  ag  or dottikon  for production of squalane and biofene derived molecules for use as oxygen scavengers in pet polymers at a facility in switzerland pending completion of process development work  and iii albemarle corporation  or albemarle  for production of biofene derived base oils at a facility in baton rouge  louisiana also pending completion of process development work 
for the future production of biofene  a manufacturing agreement with para so bioenergia sa  or para so bioenergia  in s o paulo state  brazil  under which we are constructing fermentation and separation capacity to produce our products 
our joint venture with usina s o martinho  or s o martinho  a subsidiary of s o martinho sa  one of the largest sugar and ethanol producers in brazil  pursuant to which we are building our first stand alone  large scale production facility at the s o martinho sugar and ethanol mill located in s o paulo state  brazil 
to support the expansion of our large scale production capacity in brazil  non binding letters of intent with several leading brazilian sugar and ethanol producers  including usina alvorada  or alvorada  cosan  eth bioenergia sa  or eth  and ac car guarani sa  or ac car guarani 
while our platform is able to utilize a wide variety of feedstocks  we are focusing our large scale production plans primarily on the use of brazilian sugarcane as our feedstock because of its abundance  low cost and relative price stability 
we intend to secure access to this feedstock  and expand our production capacity beyond our initial use of contract manufacturers  in a capital light manner through the production relationships we are establishing with sugar and ethanol producers in brazil 
with this approach  we expect to work with these entities to build new  bolt on facilities adjacent to their existing mills instead of building entirely new greenfield facilities  thereby reducing the capital required to establish and scale our production 
we have two operating subsidiaries  amyris brasil ltda 
formerly amyris brasil sa  or amyris brasil  and amyris fuels  llc  or amyris fuels 
amyris brasil oversees the establishment and expansion of amyris s production in brazil  and amyris fuels was established to help us develop fuel distribution capabilities in the us amyris fuels currently generates revenue from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers through a network of terminals in the eastern us as of december   we had employees worldwide  including in emeryville  california  in campinas and piricicaba  brazil  and in chicago  illinois 
we have also established a broad patent portfolio  including issued patents and patent applications pending worldwide as of february  this portfolio provides protection through coverage of composition of matter on many of our end products  our technology and research tools  and our manufacturing processes 
we were incorporated in we began selling fuels through our subsidiary amyris fuels in june since inception we have generated million in revenue  including million from amyris fuels and substantially all of the remainder from grants and collaborations and to a lesser extent from product sales of our renewable products 
industry background petroleum is a fundamental building block for many products  such as consumer products  chemicals  plastics and transportation fuels that are essential to modern economies 
recently the increased demand for petroleum in the face of limited supply  supply chain uncertainty and negative environmental impacts has created challenges to the current petroleum infrastructure 
as a result  there have been many attempts to create products comparable to petroleum derivatives without these drawbacks 
however  initial approaches have faced a number of challenges that have limited their success  including exposure to volatile feedstock pricing 
many us renewable fuels companies have focused on the conversion of commodity feedstocks  such as corn or vegetable oil  into ethanol or biodiesel 
these companies were exposed to swings in the market prices for their feedstocks  which at times made production unprofitable for a number of producers in these industries 
limited product portfolio 
companies engaging in early attempts to create renewable fuels typically focused on one end product  such as ethanol or biodiesel 
these companies generally lacked product diversity and  therefore  were vulnerable to variability of market prices and the degree of government support for their primary product 
further  the products these companies made were imperfect substitutes for the products they were intended to replace  as neither ethanol nor biodiesel can be stored or transported conventionally and both are subject to blend limits 
capital intensity 
many initial us ethanol companies utilized a vertically integrated business model that required hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and own mills 
this left them with limited ability to enter new geographies and to access new feedstock  as they were tied to their existing facilities 
dependence on policy 
the economic viability of many alternative fuels is based on government regulations and support  making it difficult to build a business with long term sustainability 
other efforts to develop alternatives to petroleum sourced products include the use of non food based feedstocks  such as cellulosic sugars sourced from wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse 
some of these approaches are showing promise and may not be influenced by commodity markets and food versus fuel concerns 
however  they are not complete solutions to the challenges above  and to date  these approaches have been limited by cost and technical considerations  among others 
our solution we seek to apply our synthetic biology platform to provide renewable  high performance alternatives to selected petroleum sourced chemicals and fuels 
our products are designed to enable our customers to reduce the environmental impact of their products without compromising performance  and  in some cases  our renewable products would provide superior performance to the petroleum sourced products they are replacing 
our business model is designed to produce these products and bring them to market in a capital light manner and  for many of our products  without reliance on government subsidies 
our industrial synthetic biology platform is designed to produce competitive products from widely available plant derived feedstocks using genetically modified yeast strains in a well established fermentation process 
we are focusing our initial large scale production efforts in brazil  which allows us to access locally grown sugarcane feedstock and to leverage the substantial infrastructure of existing sugar and ethanol mills 
our strategy our objective is to become the leading provider of renewable specialty chemicals and transportation fuels worldwide 
key elements of our strategy include targeting markets to maximize returns 
we intend to commercialize our products initially in select specialty chemical markets which are characterized by higher margin  lower volume products  where we believe we can earn positive gross margins with current production process efficiencies  as well as certain niche diesel markets where we can earn a positive margin at our current and near term production costs or where we see strong opportunity to support development of the market 
then as we lower our production costs through technical improvements  we intend to expand into broader lower margin  higher volume commodity product markets  such as the broad based fuels market and base oil lubricants markets  through joint venture arrangements 
to accelerate our entry into select new product opportunities  we will continue to enter into collaborative research  development and commercialization agreements  such as the existing agreements with cosan  firmenich  givaudan  kuraray  m g  method  michelin  p g  total and wilmar 
leveraging our technology platform to improve efficiency 
our technology platform is based on an industrial platform for strain development and includes activities to support scale up to commercial production in two pilot plant facilities  a demonstration facility 
we intend to continually apply our technology platform to lower the cost of production of our products through improvements in yields and other production process efficiencies 
focusing on brazilian sugarcane 
we are initially focusing on brazilian sugarcane as the feedstock to support our production ramp because of its abundance  low cost and relative price stability 
we are also able to use a wide variety of other feedstocks  including sweet sorghum  sugar beets  corn based dextrose and other industrial sources of plant sugar 
advancing capital light production 
we are partnering with leading sugar and ethanol mills in brazil  such as our joint venture with usina paraiso and usina s o martinho  to establish and scale production at a lower cost than the cost of greenfield mill construction 
under this approach  we expect to work selectively with brazilian sugar and ethanol producers to build new  bolt on facilities adjacent to their existing mills  instead of building entirely new facilities  thereby reducing the capital required to establish and scale our production 
our technology our synthetic biology platform enables us to modify the genetic pathways of microorganisms  primarily yeast  to turn them into living factories to produce target molecules for which we believe there may be significant market opportunities 
in addition to using our synthetic biology platform to identify and improve strains of microbes to produce target molecules  we are using our technology platform to develop production processes that we believe will allow us to scale to commercial levels 
the primary biological pathway within the microbe that we currently use to produce our target molecules is the isoprenoid pathway 
isoprenoids constitute a large  diverse class of molecules with current product applications in a wide range of industries  including specialty chemicals and fuels 
the key steps in our strain engineering and scale up process are identifying target molecules 
we start our process by identifying a commercial application where we can deliver a no compromise solution that we want to pursue 
we identify the key molecular properties that are essential to product performance in a specific commercial application and then analyze the chemical structures that drive those key performance characteristics 
finally  we identify target molecules or derivatives of molecules that are comprised of these key chemical structures and that may be produced by our yeast strains 
developing initial strains 
once we have chosen a target molecule  we identify the steps required for its production in a biological pathway 
we then seek to design a pathway to produce the target  either directly or by producing a molecule that can  through simple chemical steps  be synthesized  or converted  into the target 
once this pathway is identified  we undertake to engineer it into our yeast strains by employing the processes discussed below 
improving strain performance and process development to reduce production costs 
after we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule  the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production 
initially  we focus primarily on yield  a measure of the amount of product produced by a defined amount of sugar as the means to improve strain output 
as we advance in our scale up and commercial scale process development  we also seek to improve production output through improvements in strain productivity  the rate at which our product is produced by a given yeast strain and titer  the concentration of product in the fermentation broth 
in addition  we seek to develop processes to improve production efficiency  including separation efficiency  which is the amount of product that is captured from a fermentation run  cycle time  which is the time needed to run a full fermentation cycle  and the evolution of batch process methods to semi continuous and continuous production methods 
moving production from lab to commercial scale 
once we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule  the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production 
we design our lab scale two liter fermentors to mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot  demonstration and commercial scale 
in addition to our lab scale fermentors  we have operating pilot plants in our facilities in both emeryville  california and campinas  brazil  as well as two  liter fermentors in our campinas demonstration facility 
we are also operating three contract manufacturing facilities in the us  brazil and spain using  to  liter fermentors 
production our production operations involve two steps 
first  we produce the target molecule by means of an industrial fermentation process 
in certain cases this target molecule is itself the desired end product 
in other cases  it must be converted into the desired end product by means of chemical finishing steps 
commercial production of target fermentation molecules we have initiated commercial production of biofene  our initial fermentation molecule  by using contract manufacturers as we complete our facility at para so  brazil and our joint venture facility with usina s o martinho  sma ind stria qu mica sa  or sma 
following completion of sma  we will seek to expand our large scale production capacity of intermediate molecules by entering into agreements with owners of additional sugar and ethanol mills in brazil 
we may also use alternative production resources in other geographies 
we are currently developing the engineering designs and technical capabilities to build out facilities at existing sugar and ethanol mills to produce biofene and other target fermentation molecules 
because the bulk of our fermentation production process leverages the same equipment and process steps used to produce ethanol  we will be able to utilize much of the existing infrastructure 
we expect this capital light approach will allow us to scale production at a lower cost than the cost of greenfield mill construction 
the mill operator will retain the ability to direct the crushed sugarcane to produce either their current products or our products 
the manner in which we intend to develop our manufacturing capacity is as follows contract manufacturing 
to date  we have used contract manufacturing facilities to produce biofene in quantities needed for certification and fleet testing as well as our and initial sales 
for biofene production  we have entered into agreements with biomin and tate lyle and antibi ticos 
we have purchased certain equipment needed for production at these facilities 
we will be the owner and distributor of the biofene produced through these arrangements 
we may seek to enter into additional contract manufacturing arrangements as an efficient way to ramp our near term production 
depending primarily on the manufacturer s location and preferences  the most likely feedstocks to be used in these contracted facilities would be sugarcane syrup  sugar beet syrup  sugar beet molasses  vhp very high pol sugar or corn based dextrose 
production at para so 
we have an agreement with para so bioenergia to construct and operate a production facility on their premises 
under this agreement  para so bioenergia will supply sugar cane juice and other utilities and we are responsible for construction of the production facility 
the new production facility is being designed to process juice from up to one million tons of cane annually 
we commenced construction of this facility in august production at joint venture facility at usina s o martinho 
we formed sma in  and commenced site preparation in december and civil construction in february the sma plant was our first facility construction project and it is intended to provide a large scale production facility to support our longer term production plans 
the construction project is ongoing and our estimated completion date for the facility depends significantly on the timing and availability of financing for the project 
increasing large scale production in brazil through arrangements with sugar and ethanol mill owners 
we anticipate increasing our commercial production in brazil through arrangements with other ethanol and sugar producers 
we have in place non binding letters of intent for production relationships with several sugar and ethanol producers in brazil  including alvorada  cosan  eth and a car guarani 
alternative geographies and feedstocks for production 
although we have identified the use of new bolt on facilities adjacent to existing sugar and ethanol mills in brazil as the optimal source for a substantial portion of our primary large scale production efforts  we will also use facilities in alternative geographies for certain products 
our contract manufacturing arrangements currently include the use of facilities in the us  brazil and spain 
in addition  we are exploring other production options in the us  including evaluating the potential for the use of sweet sorghum  energy grasses  and woody biomass sourced from a variety of locations in the us as feedstock  through an integrated biorefinery grant from the us department of energy  or doe  and participation as a subcontractor to the doe s national renewable energy laboratory  or nrel  in connection with the nrel s national advanced biofuels consortium 
chemical finishing process we may sell commercially produced biofene directly or we may first perform additional chemical finishing steps to convert biofene into other finished products such as renewable squalane  lubricants  polymers  home and personal care products and diesel 
we have established an agreement with glycotech for use of the leland  north carolina facility of salisbury partners  llc to convert biofene into squalane  industrial lubricants and other final products starting in in addition  we have multiple agreements in place with dottikon for the completion of process development work 
upon successful completion of such work  dottikon may produce in switzerland pilot and large scale amounts of squalane or biofene derived molecules for use as oxygen scavengers in pet polymers or both 
we have also entered into a services agreement with albemarle under which it is completing process development work and will make pilot scale amounts of certain biofene derived base oils at its facility in baton rouge  louisiana 
we expect to enter into additional agreements with other chemical companies for finishing services to access a flexible capacity and array of services 
our products we focus on bringing forth a broad range of products to address six identified markets cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers  consumer products and transportation fuels 
cosmetics through simple chemical finishing steps  we are able to convert biofene into squalane 
squalane is used today as a moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and other personal care products 
squalane traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from shark liver oil 
we believe amyris produced squalane offers a purity that is equal or superior to squalane derived from conventional sources 
the high price of squalane to date has meant that its use has been limited to small quantities in mass market product formulations or to use in luxury products 
we believe that we are capable of producing squalane at a price that would permit formulators to use squalane more broadly 
to market and distribute squalane  we have established a relationship with soliance  a leading distributor of renewable cosmetics ingredients based in the champagne ardenne region in france and we have an agreement with nikko chemicals co 
ltd  a distributor in japan 
lubricants base oils are the building blocks of lubricating oils  which are currently derived from the crude oil refining process 
lubricants are manufactured by combining a base oil with additives that contribute additional performance properties as required by the thousands of lubricant product applications  including engine oils  gear oils  hydraulic oils and turbine oils 
biofene may be chemically modified to serve as a base oil 
the high purity synthetic base oil molecules made from biofene will enable lubricant products to perform in harsh environments under extremes of temperature  moisture  dirt and wear 
in december  we entered into an agreement with cosan to establish a joint venture for the worldwide development  production and commercialization of renewable base oils 
we established this joint venture  novvi  in june we anticipate that novvi will source biofene initially from amyris production facilities and the parties would share the development  marketing and operating costs 
flavors and fragrances since our microbial platform utilizes plant genes found in nature to make products via fermentation  we are well situated to cost effectively and sustainably produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the flavors and fragrances market 
many of the natural ingredients used in flavors and fragrances market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions 
amyris offers flavors and fragrances companies a natural route to procure these ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality 
currently  we are developing a slate of flavors and fragrances ingredients that are either derivatives of building blocks we make from fermentation eg  biofene or products directly from fermentation 
we plan to participate in the flavors and fragrance market by providing sustainable replacements that are high quality  reliably available  and competitively priced 
to begin to develop our product offerings in this area  we have established the following partnerships a collaboration and joint development agreement with firmenich  a global flavors and fragrances company headquartered in geneva  switzerland 
under this agreement  firmenich will fund and collaborate with amyris to produce a sustainable  cost effective and reliable source of a key ingredient for the flavors and fragrances market 
amyris will manufacture and supply the ingredient to firmenich  which will market and sell the ingredient or products incorporating the ingredient exclusively in the flavors and fragrance market 
both parties will share in the economic value derived from sales of the ingredient 
the agreement also grants firmenich an option to collaborate with amyris to develop a second ingredient on similar terms 
a co development agreement with givaudan  a global flavors and fragrance company headquartered in vernier  switzerland 
under the agreement  we will develop a derivative of biofene to be used as a building block for one of the proprietary fragrance ingredients in givaudan s palette 
upon achievement of certain success criteria  we will supply biofene to givaudan to derive the proprietary ingredient for the global fragrances and flavors market and share in the economic value created from the use of biofene 
polymers and plastic additives synthetic polymers are commonly used in the manufacture of thousands of products that incorporate plastics and other polymeric materials  and we believe biofene has the potential to provide significant opportunities for development of renewable products for the polymer market 
in june  we announced a partnership with m g  the world s largest producer of pet polyethylene terephthalate resins for packaging applications  to incorporate biofene as an ingredient in m g s pet processing 
m g is currently evaluating the potential for biofene to improve product performance 
upon successful completion of product development and testing  amyris would supply biofene to m g 
in august  we signed a collaboration agreement with kuraray to develop polymers from biofene 
under the agreement  kuraray will use biofene to replace petroleum derived molecules such as butadiene and isoprene in the production of specified classes of high performing polymers 
upon successful completion of the technical development program for the first polymer  amyris and kuraray would enter into a supply agreement for kuraray s exclusive use of biofene in the manufacturing and commercialization of these polymer products 
home personal care products biofene also offers a platform for development of sustainable  high performing and cost competitive ingredients for the fabric and home care such as detergents  fabric softener  dish soap  and household cleaning products and the personal care such as hair care and body care markets 
to support our development and launch of ingredients to serve these markets  we have entered into a series of agreements with p g 
these agreements include collaboration on the development of certain specialty chemicals for p g s products from biofene and a related supply agreement for biofene  which would commence upon successful completion of certain technical and commercial milestones 
in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with wilmar focused on the development and worldwide commercialization of a family of surfactants derived from biofene for use in a range of products  including consumer packaged goods  personal care products and industrial applications 
in addition  in october  we entered into a joint development agreement with method to develop molecules derived from biofene for use in home and personal care products 
as we develop and produce new chemicals via our technology platform  we will look for opportunities to use these new chemicals as is or as sustainable building blocks to make other ingredients 
transportation fuels we have selected diesel as our primary area of focus within the transportation fuels market because of its projected global demand growth  the lack of a scalable  competitive renewable product  and our belief that our fuel product has properties superior to those of existing renewable alternatives 
in general  we will produce our renewable diesel by the simple chemical step of hydrogenating our biofene 
hydrogenation is a common chemical process currently used in the production of numerous products  such as saturation of vegetable oils to make margarine 
in july  we entered into an agreement with petrobras to sell diesel derived from biofene to petrobras to blend with fuel supplied and distributed by petrobras to city bus fleets of s o paulo and rio de janeiro  brazil 
in november  we entered into an amendment of our technology license  development  research and collaboration agreement with total to establish a renewable diesel development program 
the amendment provides for an exclusive strategic collaboration for the development of renewable diesel products and contemplates that the parties will establish a joint venture for the production and commercialization of such renewable diesel products on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
the amendment also provides that commercialization and production of jet fuel  already under development pursuant to the collaboration agreement  would be conducted on an exclusive  worldwide basis through the same joint venture 
we have completed significant steps to validate our ability to produce a market accepted diesel product 
by design  our product is a hydrocarbon of similar size to many of the hydrocarbons in petroleum sourced diesel fuel 
due to the similarity of its chemical composition to that of existing petroleum sourced diesel  our product has the properties required of diesel fuel and thereby satisfies the astm d table specifications for petroleum derived diesel fuel oils 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  has registered our diesel for use as a blend with petroleum diesel in highway vehicles and non road equipment and we are working to obtain registration for a higher blend with petroleum diesel  as opposed to the typical blend of other bio diesel products with petroleum diesel 
we are currently pursuing brazilian anp ag ncia nacional do petr leo diesel fuel registration and carb california air resources board ulsd blend registration 
we have received required approvals with brazilian anp ag ncia nacional do petr leo  gas natural e biocombust veis for our fuel in the country  and are pursuing diesel fuel registration with the carb california air resources board and other relevant regulatory bodies 
our ability to enter the diesel market is also dependent upon our ability to continue to achieve the required regulatory approvals in the global markets in which we will seek to sell our diesel products 
these approvals primarily involve clearance by the relevant environmental agencies in the particular jurisdiction 
we must also be certified by a sufficient number of diesel engine manufacturers  vehicle manufacturers or operators of large trucking fleets so that our diesel will have an appropriately large and accessible addressable market 
these certification processes include fuel analysis modeling and the testing of engines and their components to ensure that the use of our diesel fuel does not degrade performance or reduce the lifecycle of the engine or cause it to fail to meet emissions standards 
we have completed successful engine testing of our diesel fuel with cummins engine company  or cummins  and mercedes benz brasil at a blend of up to  and our renewable diesel has received oem engine warranties from cummins  volkswagen ag and mercedes benz brasil for demonstration purposes 
we continue to work with other diesel engine manufacturers to qualify our product for use in their engines 
other total collaboration products our technology license  development  research and collaboration agreement with total sets forth the terms for the research  development  production and commercialization of chemical and or fuels products to be agreed on by the parties 
the agreement establishes a multi phased process through which compounds are identified  screened  selected for product feasibility study  and then ultimately selected as a lead compound for development 
to commercialize any strains and compounds that are developed  amyris and total expect to form one or more joint ventures  the first of which we expect will be the diesel joint venture described above 
both amyris and total retain certain rights to make covered products independently subject to making royalty payments to the non producing party  and total has certain rights to require amyris to work on non collaboration projects 
we have retained rights to produce and commercialize products in the following markets flavors and fragrances  cosmetics  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  food additives  and pesticides 
the first programs we are focusing on with total relate to renewable diesel and jet fuel and industrial lubricants  however  we and total retain the right to propose product development programs under these agreements in the future 
product distribution and sales we intend to distribute and sell our products either directly  through joint ventures  or with partners  depending on the market 
for most chemical applications  we intend to sell directly to specialty chemical and consumer products companies 
for example  we expect to sell directly to firmenich  givaudan  kuraray  m g  method  michelin  p g and wilmar under our agreements with them 
generally  these agreements do not include any specific purchase obligations  and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones 
in addition  we expect to commercialize certain products  including fuels and base oils through joint venture arrangements with total and cosan  respectively 
commencing in  we began developing a fuels distribution network and distribution capabilities in the us through amyris fuels 
we currently purchase ethanol produced by third parties and gasoline and sell both pure ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers 
for  wawa  inc and mansfield each accounted for more than of our reported revenues by virtue of their purchases of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline from amyris fuels 
our customers purchase ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline from us under short term agreements and spot transactions  and we currently do not have any contractual commitments from customers to purchase ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline from us over a period of time 
if we establish our joint venture with total  we believe we may no longer need the capabilities represented by amyris fuels 
intellectual property our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business  and to the extent we identify such developments  evaluate and take appropriate courses of action 
with respect to the former  our policy is to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the uspto and its foreign counterparts 
as of february   we had issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications that are owned by or licensed to us 
we also use other forms of protection such as trademark  copyright  and trade secret to protect our intellectual property  particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
we aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position 
notwithstanding the increasing backlog and patent pendency at the uspto  we have obtained us patents for many of our potential products through the use of a recently introduced accelerated examination program by the uspto 
using this procedure  we have obtained patents for various fuel products us patent no 
 directed to our renewable diesel fuel composition  us patent no 
 directed to our renewable gasoline fuel composition  and us patents no 
 and no 
 which are directed to our renewable jet products 
since obtaining our fuels patents  we have expanded the use of this program to our chemicals portfolio and have recently obtained us patent nos 
 and  for our lubricant products  and us patent nos 
 and  for our adhesive and polymer products 
we also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees  consultants  contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement 
agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us 
in addition  we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials 
competition we expect that our renewable products will compete with both the traditional  largely petroleum based specialty chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce 
chemical products the chemical products we initially plan to produce include biofene  squalane  fragrance ingredients  industrial lubricants and certain polymers 
in these markets  and other chemical markets that we may seek to enter in the future  we will compete with the established providers of the products we seek to replace 
producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies  large international chemical companies and other smaller or niche companies specializing in specific products  such as cosmetic ingredient suppliers or flavors fragrances ingredient suppliers 
we may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum based or other traditional products being offered in these markets 
we believe that there may be a number of companies seeking to develop renewable alternatives for existing chemical markets products  including those that we are initially targeting 
transportation fuel products independent and integrated oil refiners 
our competitors with respect to traditional fuel products are independent and integrated oil refiners 
these companies are also our primary competitors with respect to fuels  including jet fuel currently in use in other transportation markets 
we compete with these companies because an increasing penetration of renewable fuels reduces the need for fuels derived from traditional petroleum sources 
many of these companies are seeking to provide alternative transportation fuel products through investing in internal research and development programs or in emerging technology companies 
these technologies are in varying states of development  and the most advanced of which are those using non renewable feedstocks  such as coal 
advanced biofuels 
many other companies are exploring options for the production of diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways 
these include companies using enzymes to convert cellulosic biomass  which is non food plant material such as wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse  into fermentable sugars to be converted into renewable fuels 
biodiesel 
another source of renewable fuels products is the biodiesel industry  which is served by large  well established agricultural products companies that convert vegetable oils  and in some cases animal oils  into diesel fuel 
other companies are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels 
we believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemical and fuel markets are product price  product performance and other measures of quality  infrastructure compatibility of products  sustainability  and dependability of supply 
we believe that for our chemical products to succeed in the market  we must demonstrate that they are comparable to both existing products and other alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost  availability  performance and consumer preference characteristics 
with respect to our diesel and other transportation fuels products  we believe that our product must perform as effectively as the petroleum sourced fuel and be available on a cost competitive basis 
given the size of the traditional transportation fuels markets and the developing stage of alternatives fuels markets  we do not believe that our success will necessarily prevent other renewable diesel or other fuels products from achieving commercial success  or that the success of other renewable products will prevent our fuels products from being successful 
however  with the wide range of renewable fuels products under development  we must be successful in reaching potential customers and convincing them that ours are effective and reliable alternatives 
environmental and other regulatory matters our development and production processes involve the use  generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and international laws  regulations and permit requirements governing the use  generation  manufacture  transportation  storage  handling and disposal of these materials in the us  brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive fees  pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines  civil sanctions  permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation 
we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting 
however  future developments including our commencement of commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products  more stringent environmental regulation  policies and enforcement  the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors risks relating to our business we may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities 
the use of genetically modified microorganisms  or gmms like our yeast strains  is subject to laws and regulations in many countries 
in the us  the epa regulates the commercial use of gmms as well as potential products from the gmms 
the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use  s 
cerevisiae  is eligible for exemption from epa review because the epa recognizes it as posing a low risk given its long history of safe use and will qualify for such exemption provided that it meets certain criteria  including but not limited to use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures 
in brazil  gmms are regulated by ctnbio under its biosafety law no 
we have obtained approval from ctnbio to use gmms in our campinas facilities for research and development purposes 
we expect to encounter gmm regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products  however  the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country 
if we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to use produce our products using our yeast strains  then our business will be adversely affected 
see risk factors risks relating to our business we may face risks relating to the use of our genetically modified yeast strains and if we are not able to secure regulatory approval for the use of our yeast strains or if we face public objection to our use of them  our business could be adversely affected 
our renewable chemical products may be subject to regulation by government agencies in our target markets 
the epa administers the requirements of the toxic substances control act  or the tsca  which regulates the commercial use of chemicals 
before an entity can manufacture a chemical  it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the tsca inventory 
if the substance is listed  then manufacture can commence immediately 
if not  then in most cases a chemical abstracts service number registration and pre manufacture notice must be filed with the epa  which has up to days to review the filing 
our diesel fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies 
in the us  this includes the epa and the california air resources board 
in brazil  this includes ag ncia nacional do petr leo  or anp 
to date we have obtained registration with the epa for the use of our diesel in the us at a blend rate 
we are currently exploring registration of our fuel with the california air resources board and the european commission 
registration with each of these bodies is required for the sale and use of our fuels within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  for us to achieve full access to the us fuels market for our fuel products  we will need to obtain epa and california air resources board and potentially other state agencies certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facility  including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners  importers  blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products 
see risk factors risks relating to our business we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products 
amyris fuels is subject to various us federal regulations relating to its marketing and distribution of ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline  and it is registered with the epa in connection with its use of ethanol as a fuel additive 
in addition  amyris fuels is subject to various state regulations  including regulations regarding excise tax payments and the posting of surety bonds 
research and development we devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts 
as of february   our research and development organization included approximately employees  of whom hold phds our technology development is currently focused primarily on improving the performance of our production strains and on developing strains that produce new molecules 
to facilitate the transfer of our fermentation technology to production  we operate pilot scale fermentation facilities in both emeryville  california and campinas  brazil  and transfer strains on a regular basis through this process 
our process consists of a number of discrete steps including identifying new target molecules creating new microbial strains capable of producing the target molecule increasing product yield and productivity from microbial strains through strain modification or fermentation improvements increasing efficiency of product separation and purification continuous translation of these steps from lab to commercial scale production 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  and million and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
employees as of february   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were in the us and were in brazil 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced any employment related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or future results 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and  as a result  you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have incurred losses to date  anticipate continuing to incur losses in the future and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business  including our research and development operations  continued operation of our pilot plants and demonstration facility  engineering and design work 
further  we expect to incur costs related to implementation of multiple contract manufacturing arrangements  including equipment purchases  facility construction and technology transfer  as well as those related to the facilities that we are developing with s o martinho and para so bioenergia and deployment of our technology at other sugar and ethanol mills 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have very limited experience producing our products at the commercial scale needed for the development of our business  and we will not succeed if we cannot effectively scale our technology and processes 
to commercialize our products  we must be successful in using our yeast strains to produce target molecules at commercial scale and on an economically viable basis 
such production will require that our technology and processes be scalable from laboratory  pilot and demonstration projects and industrial scale test runs to commercial scale production 
up to and through most of  our primary focus was research and development 
in  we commenced commercial manufacturing operations at three contract manufacturing facilities biomin in brazil  antibi ticos in spain and tate lyle in the us we have very limited manufacturing experience and cannot be sure that we will be successful in establishing these or future larger scale production operations in a timely manner and on a scale that will allow us to meet our plans for commercialization 
we are outsourcing to contract manufacturers and other third parties some of the production process development work associated with commercial scale up and such third parties may not perform such development work at the level we expect 
furthermore  our technology may not perform as expected when applied at commercial scale on a sustained basis  or we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to devise a workable solution 
for example  in at our contract manufacturing facilities  contamination in the production process  problems with plant utilities  lack of automation and related human error  process modifications to reduce costs and adjust product specifications  and other similar challenges decreased process efficiency  created delays and increased our costs 
such challenges are likely to continue as we and our contract manufacturing partners develop our production processes and establish new facilities 
we may not be able to scale up our production in a timely manner  if at all  even to the extent we successfully complete product development in our laboratories and pilot and demonstration facilities and conduct successful industrial scale test runs 
if this occurs  our ability to commercialize our technology will be adversely affected  and  with respect to any products that we are able to bring to market  we may not be able to lower the cost of production  which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products and achieve profits 
similarly  our ability to produce the volume of biofene covered by our existing agreements is based in part on our ability to achieve substantially higher production efficiencies than we have to date 
we may never achieve those production efficiencies 
we will require additional financing to fund our anticipated operations and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we will continue to fund our research and development and related activities and to provide working capital to fund production  storage  distribution and other aspects of our business 
we may also from time to time consider acquisitions of other companies  assets or technologies to accelerate our research and development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  we plan to make significant capital expenditures in connection with our contract manufacturing arrangements and mill production plant arrangements 
while we plan to enter into relationships with sugar and ethanol producers for them to provide some portion or all of the capital needed to build the new  adjacent bolt on production facility  such parties may not be willing to provide such capital and we may be required to provide some or all of the financing that we currently expect to be provided by these owners 
furthermore  our anticipated working capital needs and our planned operating and capital expenditures for and will require significant inflows of cash from credit facilities and similar sources of indebtedness  as well as funding from collaboration partners 
some of these necessary financing sources are not yet subject to definitive agreements or have not committed to funding arrangements 
in addition  our anticipated working capital needs and strategic plans in and beyond will depend on our ability to identify and secure additional sources of funding beyond those we have currently identified 
such sources of funding may include equity or debt offerings  in addition to collaboration revenue and other forms of debt 
if we fail to secure such funding  we may be forced to curtail our operations  which could include reductions or delays of planned capital expenditures or scaling back our operations 
we have had to adjust the timing for construction projects relating to the s o martinho plant due to financing constraints  and the projected completion date for s o martinho is being assessed and could be subject to further delays and adjustment based on the timing and success of our financing activities 
if we are forced to curtail our operations  we may be unable to proceed with construction of certain planned production facilities  enter into definitive agreements for supply of feedstock and associated production arrangements that are currently subject to letters of intent  commercialize our products within the timeline we expect  or otherwise continue our business as currently contemplated 
if  to support our planned operations  we seek additional types of funding that involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
for example  in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock that resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock and entered into a securities purchase agreement that resulted in the issuance of million in unsecured senior convertible promissory notes that are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of 
the convertible notes contain various covenants  including restrictions on the amount of debt we are permitted to incur 
we may conduct additional financings if they become available on appropriate terms and we deem them to be consistent with our financing strategy 
if we raise additional debt financing  we may be subject to additional restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop and commercialize products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research and development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations  or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
if our major production facilities in brazil do not successfully commence operations  our customer relationships  business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we have selected brazil as the optimal geography for a substantial proportion of the initial large scale commercial production of our products  largely because of the availability of sugarcane as a feedstock and the existing infrastructure for producing  gathering and processing this sugarcane 
our business plan envisions that we will develop this production capacity primarily through arrangements with existing sugar and ethanol producers 
in order to have control over the development of our first major large scale commercial production facility in brazil  we entered into an agreement with s o martinho  one of the largest sugar and ethanol producers in brazil  for the joint ownership and development of a production facility at the s o martinho mill 
we also entered into a manufacturing agreement with para so bioenergia  also in brazil  under which we will be responsible for construction of the production facility 
a substantial component of our planned production capacity in the near and long term depends on the completion and commencement of operations at these production facilities  and development of additional facilities using similar models thereafter 
delays in completion of our production facilities at s o martinho and para so bioenergia will cause delays in commencement of large scale production and hamper our ability to reduce our production costs 
we will have to adjust our goals for production volume in and beyond based on  among other things  our ability to raise sufficient financing to fund construction and commissioning costs  delays in process development at contract manufacturing facilities and uncertainty relating to the timing of these large scale facilities 
once the facilities are operational  they must perform as we have designed them 
if we encounter significant delays  cost overruns  engineering problems  equipment supply constraints or other serious challenges in bringing these facilities online  we may be unable to produce our initial renewable products in the time frame we have planned  or we may need to continue to use contract manufacturing sources to a greater degree  which would reduce our expected gross margins 
further  if our efforts to complete  and commence production at  these facilities are not successful  other mill owners in brazil may decide not to work with us to develop additional production facilities  demand more favorable terms or delay their commitment to invest capital in our production 
our construction of manufacturing facilities at s o martinho and para so bioenergia requires significant capital expenditures and subjects us to significant liquidity and production risks 
our initial large scale production facility construction plan was for the plant at s o martinho and we are designing and managing the project 
we expect the construction costs of the new facility to total approximately million 
ultimately  under the terms of our joint venture agreements  s o martinho will contribute the lower of r million reais us million based on the exchange rate at december  and half of the aggregate cost of construction with us contributing the remainder  however the timing of contributions from s o martinho depend on in part on the successful commencement of commercial operations at the plant  which could leave us vulnerable in the event we encounter challenges in building the facility or bringing it online  delays in achieving commercial viability with our biofene production process  disputes with s o martinho or other unanticipated events that may occur prior to the time s o martinho makes its capital contribution 
in addition  because s o martinho s contribution is capped  we will bear the responsibility for construction costs in excess of those anticipated 
furthermore  under our manufacturing agreement with para so bioenergia  we are responsible for building fermentation and separation capacity to establish the planned production facility 
we anticipate funding construction of such facilities with our working capital and with debt and other financing  however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise financing for these projects in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms in a timely manner  and we have already had to delay certain construction projects associated with the s o martinho plant due to financing constraints 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds or are required to conserve working capital for other uses  we may be forced to delay or terminate projects  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve target production levels in the coming years 
our joint venture with s o martinho subjects us to certain legal and financial terms that could adversely affect us 
the terms of our joint venture with s o martinho are complex and are set forth in a number of agreements and schedules 
if we and s o martinho disagree over the interpretation of any of these joint venture documents  the future success of the joint venture may be impaired and any amount that we have invested in it may be at risk 
the joint venture has agreed to purchase  and s o martinho has agreed to provide  feedstock for a price that is based on the average return that s o martinho could receive from the production of its current products  sugar and ethanol 
if the cost of these products increases relative to the price at which we can sell the output that we are required to purchase from the joint venture  our return on sales of products produced by the joint venture would be adversely affected 
we are required to purchase the output of the joint venture for the first four years at a price that guarantees the return of s o martinho s investment plus a fixed interest rate 
we may not be able to sell the output at a price that allows us to achieve anticipated  or any  level of profitability on the product we acquire under these terms 
similarly  the return that we are required to provide the joint venture for products after the first four years may have an adverse effect on the profitability we achieve from acquiring the mill s output 
finally  our purchase obligation with the mill requires us to purchase the output regardless of whether we have a customer for such output  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to sell the output that we are required to purchase 
if the joint venture is terminated  we would be required to buy the joint venture s assets at fair value and transfer them to another location 
in that event  we could incur significant unexpected costs and be required to find alternative locations for our facility  which would substantially delay the commencement of production 
in addition  if amyris brasil becomes controlled  directly or indirectly  by a competitor of s o martinho  then s o martinho has the right to acquire our interest in the joint venture and if s o martinho becomes controlled  directly or indirectly  by a competitor of ours  then we have the right to sell our interest in the joint venture to s o martinho 
in either case  the purchase price is to be determined in accordance with the joint venture agreements  and we would continue to have the obligation to acquire products produced by the joint venture for the remainder of the term of the supply agreement then in effect even though we might no longer be involved in the joint venture s management 
we consolidate our joint venture with s o martinho in accordance with the guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires an ongoing assessment of whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance 
we may be unable to consolidate this joint venture in the future  if we no longer meet the requirements for consolidation as a variable interest entity 
we plan to enter into arrangements with brazilian sugar and ethanol producers to produce a substantial portion of our products  and if we are not able to complete these arrangements in a timely manner and on terms favorable to us  our business will be adversely affected 
to expand our production in brazil beyond that of our initial production facilities with biomin  antibi ticos  tate lyle  s o martinho and para so bioenergia  we intend to enter into agreements with sugar and ethanol producers in brazil that require them to make a substantial capital or operating contribution to produce our renewable products 
in return  we expect to provide them with a share of the higher gross margin we believe we will realize from the sale of these products relative to their existing products 
there can be no assurance that a sufficient number of brazilian sugar and ethanol mill owners will accept the opportunity to partner with us for the production of our products  whether on those terms or at all 
reluctance on the part of mill owners may be caused  for example  by their failure to understand our technology or product opportunities or agree with the greater economic benefits that we believe they can achieve from partnering with us 
mill owners may also be reluctant or unable to obtain needed capital  or they may be limited by existing contractual obligations with other third parties  liability  health and safety concerns  additional maintenance  training  operating and other ongoing expenses 
we have entered into letters of intent with certain brazilian sugar and ethanol producers to produce our products and s o martinho has the option for production at a second mill  but these do not bind either the mill owner or us to enter into and proceed with a formal relationship 
in addition  there are numerous issues regarding these mill relationships that must be successfully negotiated with each of the mill owners and we may not be successful in completing these negotiations 
even if sugar and ethanol producers are willing to build new facilities and produce our products  they may do so only on economic terms that place more of the cost  or confer less of the economic return  on us than we currently anticipate 
if we are not successful in negotiations with sugar and ethanol mill owners  our cost of gaining this production capacity may be higher than we anticipate in terms of up front costs  capital expenditure or lost future returns  and we may not gain the production base that we need in brazil to allow us to grow our business 
building new  bolt on facilities adjacent to existing sugar and ethanol mills for production of our products requires significant capital  and if mill owners are unwilling to contribute capital  or do not have or have access to this capital  production of our products would be more limited or more expensive than expected and our business would be harmed 
we expect to expand our production capacity over time using a capital light approach  through which mill owners would invest a substantial portion or all of the capital needed to build our bolt on production facilities  in exchange for a share of the higher gross margin from the sale of our renewable chemicals and fuels  as compared to their current products 
mill owners may perceive this construction as a costly process requiring substantial capital or operating contribution 
mill owners may not have sufficient capital of their own for this purpose or may not be willing or able to secure financing 
as a result  they may choose not to contribute the amount of capital that we anticipate or may need to seek external sources of financing  which may not be available 
if the mill owner needs to obtain financing through debt  we may be required to provide a guarantee 
furthermore  even if we are able to establish mill relationships where mill owners contribute desired levels of capital  we will be required to contribute significant capital ourselves  as is the case with the facilities at biomin  antibi ticos  tate lyle  s o martinho and para so bioenergia 
as we add relationships and commit to building additional production facilities  we will require additional financial resources to finance such projects  which could include equity financing  debt and additional contributions from existing and new collaboration partners 
even if sugar and ethanol producers are attracted to the opportunity  they may not be able to obtain credit to pursue it  which could adversely affect our ability to develop the production capacity needed to allow us to grow our business 
our reliance on contract manufacturers for near term production exposes us to risks relating to the costs  contractual terms  location  equipment installation  technology transfer and availability of that contract manufacturing and could adversely affect our growth 
we commenced commercial production of biofene and some specialty chemical products in through the use of contract manufacturers  and we anticipate that we will continue to use contract manufacturers for the next several years 
setting up sufficient contract manufacturing facilities requires us to make significant capital expenditures  which reduces our cash and subjects us to losses from depreciation 
for example  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant capital expenditures in connection with our contract manufacturing arrangements  including biomin in brazil  tate lyle in the us  and antibi ticos in spain 
in addition  many of our contract manufacturing agreements contain terms that commit us to pay for such capital expenditures and other costs incurred by the plant operators and owners  which could result in contractual liability for us even if we determine that we no longer wish to pursue a particular contract manufacturing arrangement 
some of such agreements also contain requirements to pay bonuses for milestone achievements by the contractor  minimum offtake requirements with penalties for failure to purchase specified amounts in a given period  and other terms that create contingent liabilities or other obligations for us 
any failure to comply with such requirements could result in legal claims against us  resulting in additional liability and diverting management attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that contract manufacturers will be available when we need their services  that they will be willing to dedicate a portion of their capacity to our projects  or that we will be able to reach acceptable price and other terms with them for the provision of their production services 
if we are unable to secure the services of such third parties when and as needed  we may lose customer opportunities and the growth of our business may be impaired 
also  in order for production to commence under our contract manufacturing arrangements  we will generally have to provide equipment needed for the production of our products and we cannot be assured that such equipment can be ordered  or installed  on a timely basis  at acceptable costs  or at all 
in addition  to establish new manufacturing facilities we need to transfer our yeast strains and production processes from lab to commercial plants controlled by third parties  which may pose technical or operational challenges that delay production or increase our costs 
the locations of contract manufacturers can pose additional cost  logistics and feedstock challenges 
if production capacity is available at a plant that is remote from usable chemical finishing or distribution facilities  or from customers  we will be required to incur additional expenses in shipping products to other locations 
such costs could include shipping costs  compliance with export and import controls  tariffs and additional taxes  among others 
in addition  we may be required to use feedstock from a particular region for a given production facility 
the feedstock available in a particular region may not be the least expensive or most effective feedstock for production  which could significantly raise our overall production cost until we are able to optimize the supply chain 
for example  we currently rely on antibi ticos in spain for a large percentage of our production volume 
this reliance means that we must ship biofene produced in spain to satisfy demand in various locations around the world 
in addition  antibi ticos uses non sugarcane syrup as its feedstock source  which results in higher production costs than using brazilian sugarcane syrup used in our brazilian facilities 
we rely on third parties for process development and such third parties may not be successful in helping us achieve the production efficiency we need 
we have outsourced some of our production process development to contract manufacturers and other third parties and are relying on them to help us achieve production efficiency in our commercial scale up efforts 
such third parties may not perform this work as well as we need them to in order for us to produce our products in a commercially viable manner 
for example  third parties may prioritize other projects or customers or lack expertise or resources at any given time 
failures to develop our production process could prevent us from being able to offer our planned products at competitive prices  on the timeline we expect  or at all 
in addition  we expect that our production costs using contract manufacturers will be higher  based on scale of operations  feedstock and contract manufacturing economics  than the costs to produce our products in sugar and ethanol mills with which we have entered into long term relationships 
if we are unable to decrease our production costs  we may not be able to produce our products at competitive prices and our ability to grow our business will be limited 
currently  our costs of production are not low enough to allow us to offer many of our planned products at competitive prices 
for us to establish significant sales of our specialty chemicals or fuels  we must achieve commercially viable production efficiencies and cost structures 
our production cost depends on many factors that could have a negative effect on our ability to offer our planned products at competitive prices 
for example  the price of feedstock and our ability to build large scale production capacity will have a significant impact on our pricing 
other factors that impact our production cost include yield  productivity  separation efficiency and chemical process efficiency 
yield refers to the amount of the desired molecule that can be produced from a fixed amount of feedstock 
productivity represents the rate at which our product is produced by a given yeast strain 
separation efficiency refers to the amount of desired product produced in the fermentation process that we are able to extract and the time that it takes to do so 
chemical process efficiency refers to the cost and yield for the chemical finishing steps that convert our target molecule into a desired product 
in order to successfully enter transportation fuels and certain chemical markets  we must produce those products at significantly lower cost  which will require both substantially higher yields than we have achieved to date and other significant improvements in production efficiency  including in productivity and in separation and chemical process efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to make these improvements or reduce our production costs sufficiently to offer our planned products at competitive prices  and any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 
our ability to establish substantial commercial sales of our products is subject to many risks  any of which could prevent or delay revenue growth and adversely impact our customer relationships  business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our products will be approved or accepted by customers  that customers will choose our products over competing products  or that we will be able to sell our products profitably at prices and with features sufficient to establish demand 
although we have begun to sell squalane and some diesel  we are in the very early stages of selling our products into the commercial markets we are targeting 
our sales and marketing efforts for our initial products are primarily focused on a small number of target customers and we will need to convince them that our products are comparable to or better than products they currently use that we seek to replace  both in terms of cost and performance 
in addition  these customers will need to complete product qualification procedures  which may not be achieved in a timely manner or at all 
we also face various risks related to commercial production  including obtaining assistance of contract manufacturers  production process development and production efficiency as discussed in the production risk factors above 
our manufacturing operations require sugar feedstock  and the inability to obtain such feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner may limit our ability to produce our products 
we anticipate that the production of our products will require large volumes of feedstock 
in the near term  we will rely on a mixture of feedstock sources for use at our contract manufacturing operations  including corn based dextrose  beet molasses and cane sugar 
for our large scale production facilities in brazil  we expect to rely primarily on brazilian sugarcane 
we cannot predict the future availability or price of these various feedstocks  nor can we be sure that our mill partners  which we expect to supply the sugarcane feedstock necessary to produce our products in brazil  will be able to supply it in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner 
furthermore  to the extent we are required to rely on sugar feedstock other than brazilian sugarcane  the cost of such feedstock may be higher than we expect  increasing our anticipated production costs 
feedstock crop yields and sugar content depend on weather conditions  such as rainfall and temperature that vary 
weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the ethanol and sugar industries by causing crop failures or reduced harvests 
excessive rainfall can adversely affect the supply of sugarcane and other sugar feedstock available for the production of our products by reducing the sucrose content and limiting growers ability to harvest 
crop disease and pestilence can also occur from time to time and can adversely affect feedstock growth  potentially rendering useless or unusable all or a substantial portion of affected harvests 
with respect to sugarcane  our initial primary feedstock  the limited amount of time during which it keeps its sugar content after harvest and the fact that sugarcane is not itself a traded commodity increases these risks and limits our ability to substitute supply in the event of such an occurrence 
if production of sugarcane or any other feedstock we may use to produce our products is adversely affected by these or other conditions  our production will be impaired  and our business will be adversely affected 
we have entered into a number of agreements for the development  initial commercialization and sale of certain products that contain important technical  development and commercial milestones 
if we do not meet those milestones our future revenue and financial results will be harmed 
we have entered into a number of agreements regarding arrangements for the further development of certain of our products and  in some cases  for ultimate sale to the customer under the agreement 
none of these agreements affirmatively obligates the other party to purchase specific quantities of any products at this time  and these agreements contain important conditions that must be satisfied before any such purchases may be made 
these conditions include research and development milestones and technical specifications that must be achieved to the satisfaction of our customers  which we cannot be certain we will achieve 
some agreements provide that we will not initiate sales until we achieve advances in production efficiency to lower production costs 
in addition  these agreements contain exclusivity and other terms that may limit our ability to commercialize our products and technology in ways that we do not currently envision 
if we do not achieve these contractual milestones  our revenues and financial results will be harmed 
our relationship with our strategic partner total may have a substantial impact on our company 
we have entered into a strategic relationship with total 
as part of this relationship  total has made a significant equity investment in our company and has certain board membership rights  as well as certain first negotiation rights in the event of a sale of our company 
as a result  total will have access to a significant amount of information about our company and the ability to influence our management and affairs 
total s right of first negotiation may adversely affect our ability to complete a change in control transaction that our board of directors believes is in the best interests of stockholders other than total 
we also entered into a license  development  research and collaboration agreement with an affiliate of total  under which we may develop  produce and commercialize products with total 
the agreement provides for total to pay up to the first million in research costs for selected research and development projects  but we must agree with total on the product development projects we wish to pursue 
although we have agreed on two initial product development programs  we have not yet finalized all relevant terms and conditions for those programs 
we cannot be certain that we will agree on any future product development projects 
our ability to successfully pursue product development under this agreement will depend  among other things  on our ability to work cooperatively with total 
if we cannot agree to the final terms and conditions for our initial projects  or agree on any subsequent projects  then we would not receive the research and development funding we expect from total  and this could adversely affect our product development plans and would lead to an impairment of our deferred charged assets 
in addition  total has a right of first negotiation with us with respect to exclusive commercialization arrangements that we would propose to enter into with certain third parties  as well as the right to purchase any of our products on terms not less favorable than those offered to or received by us from third parties in any market where total or its affiliates have a significant market position 
these rights might inhibit potential strategic partners or potential customers from entering into negotiations with us about future business opportunities 
further  the agreement is complex and covers a range of future activities  and disputes may arise between us and total that could delay the programs on which we are working or could prevent the commercialization of products developed under our collaboration agreement 
total also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement in the event we undergo a sale or change of control to certain entities  which could discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to acquire us 
in november  we entered into an amendment of the collaboration agreement that provides for an exclusive strategic collaboration for the development of renewable diesel products and contemplates that the parties will establish a joint venture for the production and commercialization of such renewable diesel products on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
it also provides that commercialization and production of jet fuel  already under development pursuant to the original collaboration agreement  would be conducted on an exclusive  worldwide basis through the same joint venture 
further  the amendment provides the joint venture with the right to produce and commercialize certain other chemical products made through the use of our technology on a non exclusive basis 
in addition to requiring us to work with total in these key strategic areas of our business  the amendment contains a number of provisions that create contractual risk for us 
these include various provisions that allow total to terminate its efforts with respect to the development project  reduce its funding  not participate in the joint venture  and or require royalty payments by us 
for example  the amendment provides that definitive agreements to form the joint venture must be in place by march  or another date as agreed to by the parties or the renewable diesel program  including any further collaboration payments by total related to the renewable diesel program  will terminate 
the continuation of the renewable diesel program and the formation of the joint venture are also subject to certain mutual intellectual property due diligence conditions 
under the amendment  each party retains certain rights to independently produce and sell renewable diesel under specified circumstances subject to paying royalties to the other party 
in addition  total has an option  upon completion of the renewable diesel program  to notify us that it does not wish to pursue production or commercialization of renewable diesel under the amendment 
if total exercises this right  we are obligated pay total specified royalties based on our net income 
such royalty payments would also include a share of net proceeds received by us from any sale of our renewable diesel business 
an increase in the price and profitability of ethanol and sugar relative to our products could adversely affect our arrangements with sugar and ethanol producers 
in order to induce owners of sugar and ethanol facilities to produce our products  we generally have planned to compensate them for the feedstock consumed in the production of our products in an amount equal to the revenue they would have realized had they instead produced their traditional products  plus any incremental costs incurred in the production of our products over their usual production costs 
also  as we sell our products  we expect to share a portion of the realized gross margin with these mill owners 
an increase in the price of ethanol or sugar relative to the price at which we can sell our products could result in the cost of our products increasing without a corresponding increase in the price at which we can sell our products 
in this event our results of operations would be adversely affected 
if ethanol prices are sufficiently high that the return from converting a given amount of sugarcane to ethanol exceeds the return from converting that amount of sugarcane into our products  then we will have to compensate the mill owner for that loss or risk the mill owner reverting to the production of ethanol and not producing our products at all 
many factors could cause this unfavorable price dislocation 
if sugar prices increase over a sustained period of time  this may encourage sugar production at the expense of ethanol in mills with flexibility to produce both products  which in turn could cause domestic prices in brazilian reais for ethanol to increase 
in addition  the brazilian government currently requires the use of anhydrous ethanol as a gasoline additive 
any change in these government policies could affect ethanol demand in a way that discourages mill owners from producing our products 
the price of sugarcane feedstock can be volatile as a result of changes in industry policy and may increase the cost of production of our products 
in brazil  conselho dos produtores de cana  a car e lcool council of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol producers  or consecana  an industry association of producers of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol  sets market terms and prices for general supply  lease and partnership agreements for sugarcane 
changes in such prices and terms could result in higher sugarcane prices and or a significant decrease in the volume of sugarcane available for the production of our products 
if consecana were to cease to be involved in this process  such prices and terms could become more volatile 
any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our initial large scale commercial production capacity is planned for brazil  and our business will be adversely affected if we do not operate effectively in that country 
for the foreseeable future  we will be subject to risks associated with the concentration of essential product sourcing and operations in brazil 
in the past  the brazilian economy was characterized by frequent and occasionally extensive intervention by the brazilian government and unstable economic cycles 
the brazilian government has changed in the past  and may change in the future  monetary  taxation  credit  tariff and other policies to influence the course of brazil s economy 
for example  the government s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls  adjusting interest rates  imposing taxes and exchange controls and limiting imports into brazil 
we have no control over  and cannot predict  what policies or actions the brazilian government may take in the future 
for example  the brazilian government may take actions to support state controlled entities in our industry that could adversely affect us 
our business  financial performance and prospects may be adversely affected by  among others  the following factors delays or failures in securing licenses  permits or other governmental approvals necessary to build and operate facilities and use our yeast strains to produce products  rapid consolidation in the sugar and ethanol industries in brazil  which could result in a decrease in competition  political  economic  diplomatic or social instability in or affecting brazil  changing interest rates  tax burden and policies  effects of changes in currency exchange rates  exchange controls and restrictions on remittances abroad  inflation  land reform movements  export or import restrictions that limit our ability to move our products out of brazil or interfere with the import of essential materials into brazil  changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products or repatriate profits to the us  tariffs  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  successful compliance with us and foreign laws that regulate the conduct of business abroad  an inability  or reduced ability  to protect our intellectual property in brazil including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 
such factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict whether the current or future brazilian government will implement changes to existing policies on taxation  exchange controls  monetary strategy and social security  among others 
we cannot estimate the impact of any such changes on the brazilian economy or our operations 
we may face risks relating to the use of our genetically modified yeast strains and if we are not able to secure regulatory approval for the use of our yeast strains or if we face public objection to our use of them  our business could be adversely affected 
the use of genetically modified microorganisms  or gmms  such as our yeast strains  is subject to laws and regulations in many countries  some of which are new and some of which are still evolving 
public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of  and ethical concerns over  genetic research and gmms could influence public acceptance of our technology and products 
in the us  the environmental protection agency  or epa  regulates the commercial use of gmms as well as potential products from the gmms 
while the strain of genetically modified yeast that we currently use for the development and anticipate using for the commercial production of our target molecules  s 
cerevisiae  is eligible for exemption from epa review because it is recognized as posing a low risk  we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption  including but not limited to use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures  and we cannot be sure that we will meet such criteria in a timely manner  or at all 
if exemption of s 
cerevisiae is not obtained  our business may be substantially harmed 
in addition to s 
cerevisiae  we may seek to use different gmms in the future that will require epa approval 
if approval of different gmms is not secured  our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected 
in brazil  gmms are regulated by the national biosafety technical commission  or ctnbio 
we have obtained approval from ctnbio to use gmms in a contained environment in our campinas facilities for research and development purposes as well as at biomin  our first contract manufacturing facility in brazil 
in addition  we have obtained initial commercial approval from ctnbio for one of our current yeast strains 
as we continue to develop new yeast strains and deploy our technology at new production facilities in brazil  we will be required to obtain further approvals from ctnbio in order to use these strains in commercial production in brazil 
we may not be able to obtain approvals from relevant brazilian authorities on a timely basis  or at all  and if we do not  our ability to produce our products in brazil would be impaired  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to our production operations in the us and brazil  we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with antibi ticos in spain and expect to identify other locations for production around the world 
the use of gmm technology is strictly regulated in the european union  which has established various directives for member states regarding regulation of the use of such technology  including notification processes for contained use of such technology 
we expect to encounter gmm regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to establish production capabilities  and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country 
if we cannot meet the applicable requirements in other countries in which we intend to produce products using our yeast strains  or if it takes longer than anticipated to obtain such approvals  our business could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products 
our renewable chemical products may be subject to government regulation in our target markets 
in the us  the epa administers the toxic substances control act  or tsca  which regulates the commercial registration  distribution  and use of many chemicals 
before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical  it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the tsca inventory 
if the substance is listed  then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately 
if not  then in most cases a chemical abstracts service number registration and pre manufacture notice must be filed with the epa  which has up to days to review the filing 
some of the products we produce or plan to produce  such as biofene and squalane  are already in the tsca inventory 
others  such as our lubricants  farnesane diesel and new jet fuel molecules  are not yet listed 
we may not be able to expediently receive approval from the epa to list the molecules we would like to make on the tsca registry  resulting in delays or significant increases in testing requirements 
a similar program exists in the european union  called reach registration  evaluation  authorization  and restriction of chemical substances 
we similarly need to register our products with the european commission  and this process could cause delays or significant costs 
to the extent that other geographies  such as brazil  may rely on tsca or reach for chemical registration in their geographies  delays with the us or european authorities may subsequently delay entry into these markets as well 
our diesel fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies  including the epa and the california air resources board in the us and ag ncia nacional do petr leo  or anp  in brazil 
to date  we have obtained registration with the epa for the use of our diesel in the us at a blend rate with petroleum diesel 
we are currently working to secure anp approval for use of our diesel in brazil at a blend rate 
we are also currently in the process of registration of our fuel with the california air resources board and the european commission 
registration with each of these bodies is required for the sale and use of our fuels within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  for us to achieve full access to the us fuels market for our fuel products  we will need to obtain epa and california air resources board and potentially other state agencies certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facilities  including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners  importers  blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products 
we expect to encounter regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to sell our renewable chemical and fuel products  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all 
if our chemical and fuel products do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all  then we may not be able to commercialize our products and our business will be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that our products will be approved or accepted by customers in specialty chemical markets 
the markets we intend to enter first are primarily those for specialty chemical products used by large consumer products or specialty chemical companies 
in entering these markets  we intend to sell our products as alternatives to chemicals currently in use  and in some cases the chemicals that we seek to replace have been used for many years 
the potential customers for our molecules generally have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may have a resistance to changing these processes and components 
these potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers  influenced by consumer preference  manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components  supplier operating history  regulatory issues  product liability and other factors  many of which are unknown to  or not well understood by  us 
satisfying these processes may take many months or years 
if we are unable to convince these potential customers that our products are comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that the use of our products is otherwise to their benefits  we will not be successful in entering these markets and our business will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to satisfy the significant product qualification requirements of equipment manufacturers  we may not be able to successfully enter markets for transportation fuels  and our business would be adversely affected 
in order for our diesel fuel product to be accepted in various countries around the world  diesel engine manufacturers must determine that the use of our fuels in their equipment will not invalidate product warranties and that they otherwise regard our diesel as an acceptable fuel 
in addition  we must successfully demonstrate to these manufacturers that our fuel does do not degrade the performance or reduce the life cycle of their engines or cause them to fail to meet emissions standards 
meeting these suitability standards can be a time consuming and expensive process  and we may invest substantial time and resources into such qualification efforts without ultimately securing approval 
to date  our diesel fuel products have achieved limited approvals from certain engine manufacturers  but we cannot be assured that other engine or vehicle manufacturers or fleet operators  will approve usage of our fuels 
although our diesel fuel satisfies existing pipeline operator and fuel distributor requirements  such fuel has not been reviewed nor transported by such operators as of this date 
if these operators impose volume limitations on the transport of our fuels  our ability to sell our fuels may be impaired 
our ability to sell a jet fuel product will be subject to the same types of qualification requirements as our diesel fuel  although we believe the qualification process will take longer and will be more expensive than the process for diesel 
we expect our international operations to expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates and rates of foreign inflation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently incur some costs and expenses in brazilian reais and may in the future incur additional expenses in foreign currencies and derive a portion of our revenues in the local currencies of customers throughout the world 
as a result  our revenues and results of operations are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations  which we may not be able to manage successfully 
during the past few decades  the brazilian currency in particular has faced frequent and substantial exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that the real will not significantly appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar in the future 
we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in the foreign countries where we incur costs and expenses or the decline in value of the us dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in us dollars 
for example  future measures by the central bank of brazil to control inflation  including interest rate adjustments  intervention in the foreign exchange market and changes to the fixed the value of the real  may weaken the us dollar in brazil 
whether in brazil or otherwise  we may not be able to adjust the prices of our products to offset the effects of inflation or foreign currency appreciation on our cost structure  which could increase our costs and reduce our net operating margins 
if we do not successfully manage these risks through hedging or other mechanisms  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we expect to face competition for our specialty chemical and transportation fuels products from providers of petroleum based products and from other companies seeking to provide alternatives to these products  and if we cannot compete effectively against these companies or products we may not be successful in bringing our products to market or further growing our business after we do so 
we expect that our renewable products will compete with both the traditional  largely petroleum based specialty chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce 
in the specialty chemical markets that we are initially seeking to enter  and in other chemical markets that we may seek to enter in the future  we will compete primarily with the established providers of chemicals currently used in these products 
producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies  large international chemical companies and other companies specializing in specific products  such as squalane or essential oils 
we may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum based or other traditional products being offered in these markets 
in the transportation fuels market  we expect to compete with independent and integrated oil refiners  advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies 
these refiners compete with us by selling traditional fuel products and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non renewable feedstocks  such as natural gas and coal  as well as processes using renewable feedstocks  such as vegetable oil and biomass 
we also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways 
these include advanced biofuels companies using specific enzymes that they have developed to convert cellulosic biomass  which is non food plant material such as wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse  into fermentable sugars 
similar to us  some companies are seeking to use engineered enzymes to convert sugars  in some cases from cellulosic biomass and in others from natural sugar sources  into renewable diesel and other fuels 
biodiesel companies convert vegetable oils and animal oils into diesel fuel and some are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels 
with the emergence of many new companies seeking to produce chemicals and fuels from alternative sources  we may face increasing competition from alternative fuels and chemicals companies 
as they emerge  some of these companies may be able to establish production capacity and commercial partnerships to compete with us 
if we are unable to establish production and sales channels that allow us to offer comparable products at attractive prices  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies 
we believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are product price  product performance and other measures of quality  infrastructure compatibility of products  sustainability  and dependability of supply 
the oil companies  large chemical companies and well established agricultural products companies with whom we compete are much larger than we are  have  in many cases  well developed distribution systems and networks for their products  have valuable historical relationships with the potential customers we are seeking to serve and have much more extensive sales and marketing programs in place to promote their products 
in order to be successful  we must convince customers that our products are at least as effective as the traditional products they are seeking to replace and must provide our products on a cost competitive basis with these traditional products and other available alternatives 
some of our competitors may use their influence to impede the development and acceptance of renewable products of the type that we are seeking to produce 
we believe that for our chemical products to succeed in the market  we must demonstrate that our products are comparable alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost  availability  performance  and consumer preference characteristics 
with respect to our diesel and other transportation fuels products  we believe that our product must perform as effectively as petroleum based fuel  or alternative fuels  and be available on a cost competitive basis 
in addition  with the wide range of renewable fuels products under development  we must be successful in reaching potential customers and convincing them that ours are effective and reliable alternatives 
amyris fuels currently competes with regional distributors in its purchase  distribution and sale of third party ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline in the southeastern us and competes with other suppliers based on price  convenience and reliability of supply 
a decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum based products may reduce demand for many of our renewable products and may otherwise adversely affect our business 
we anticipate that most of our renewable products  and in particular our fuels  will be marketed as alternatives to corresponding petroleum based products 
if the price of oil falls  we may be unable to produce products that are cost effective alternatives to their petroleum based products 
declining oil prices  or the perception of a future decline in oil prices  may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers or prevent potential customers from entering into agreements with us to buy our products 
during sustained periods of lower oil prices we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our pursuit of new product opportunities may not be technically feasible  which would limit our ability to expand our product line and sources of revenues 
our technology provides us with the capability to genetically engineer microbes to produce potentially thousands of types of molecules 
in order to grow our business over time we will need to  and we intend to  commit substantial resources  alone or with collaboration partners  to the development and analysis of these new molecules and the new pathways  or microbial strains  required to produce them 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in creating microbial strains that are capable of producing each target molecule or that the molecule can be produced with the required purity profile for a given market in a cost effective manner 
for example  some target molecules may be toxic to the microbe  which means that the production of the molecule kills the microbe 
other molecules may be biologically producible in small amounts but cannot be produced in quantities adequate for commercial production 
alternatively  the compounds are produced in adequate quantities but  because they are volatile  we are unable to capture the compounds in commercially adequate quantities or at a commercially viable cost 
in addition  some of our microbes may have longer production cycles that may make production of the target molecules more costly 
if we are unable to resolve issues of this nature  we may not be able to expand our product line to introduce new sources of future revenues 
changes in government regulations  including subsidies and economic incentives  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
the market for renewable fuels is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies 
changes to existing or adoption of new domestic or foreign federal  state and local legislative initiatives that impact the production  distribution or sale of renewable fuels may harm our renewable fuels business 
for example  in  the us congress passed an alternative fuels mandate that called for more than billion gallons of liquid transportation fuels sold in to come from alternative sources  including renewable fuels  a mandate that grows to billion gallons by of this amount  a minimum of billion gallons must be advanced biofuels  mostly cellulosic  by in the us and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
any reduction in mandated requirements for fuel alternatives and additives to gasoline or diesel may cause demand for biofuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of renewable fuels 
in addition  in december  the us congress did not renew legislation that extended tax credits to blenders of certain renewable fuel products and is not likely to renew them retroactively 
the absence of tax credits  subsidies and other incentives in the us and foreign markets for renewable fuels  or any inability of our customers to access such credits  subsidies and incentives  may adversely affect demand for our products and increase the overall cost of commercialization of our renewable fuels  which would adversely affect our renewable fuels business 
in addition  in december  a us federal court found the state of california s low carbon fuel standard unconstitutional  which could have a negative impact on demand for advanced renewable fuels 
the resulting market uncertainty regarding this and future standards and policies may also affect our ability to develop new renewable products or to license our technologies to third parties and to sell products to our end customers 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concerns associated with renewable fuels  including land usage  national security interests and food crop usage  continue to receive legislative  industry and public attention 
this could result in future legislation  regulation and or administrative action that could adversely affect our business 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business or the business of our partners or customers  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the production of our products will depend on the availability of feedstock  especially sugarcane 
agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations 
governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry  such as taxes  tariffs  duties  subsidies  incentives and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products  can influence the planting of certain crops  the location and size of crop production  whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded  the volume and types of imports and exports  and the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials 
future government policies may adversely affect the supply of sugarcane  restrict our ability to use sugarcane to produce our products  and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
we may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials both in the us and overseas 
although we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products in an effort to comply with these laws and regulations  we cannot be sure that our safety measures are compliant or capable of eliminating the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use  storage  handling or disposal of hazardous materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that violations of environmental  health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error  accident  equipment failure or other causes 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and the failure to comply with past  present  or future laws could result in the imposition of fines  third party property damage  product liability and personal injury claims  investigation and remediation costs  the suspension of production  or a cessation of operations  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations  which could impair our research  development or production efforts and harm our business 
our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our revenues and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our results of operations on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
factors that could cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate include achievement  or failure to achieve  technology  product development or manufacturing milestones needed to allow us to enter identified markets on a cost effective basis  delays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the completion or commissioning of new production facilities  or the time to ramp up and stabilize production following completion of a new production facility  disruptions in the production process at any facility where we produce our products  the timing  size and mix of sales to customers for our products  increases in price or decreases in availability of feedstock  the unavailability of contract manufacturing capacity altogether or at anticipated cost  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  gains or losses associated with our hedging activities  especially in amyris fuels  fluctuations in the price of and demand for sugar  ethanol  and petroleum based and other products for which our products are alternatives  seasonal production and sale of our products  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  unanticipated expenses associated with changes in governmental regulations and environmental  health and safety requirements  reductions or changes to existing fuel and chemical regulations and policies  departure of executives or other key management employees  our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income  business interruptions such as earthquakes and other natural disasters  our ability to integrate businesses that we may acquire  risks associated with the international aspects of our business  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
due to these factors and others the results of any quarterly or annual period may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors and may not be meaningful indications of our future performance 
disruption of transportation and logistics services or insufficient investment in public infrastructure could adversely affect our business 
we intend to conduct initial large scale manufacturing of most of our renewable products in brazil  where existing transportation infrastructure is underdeveloped 
substantial investments required for infrastructure changes and expansions may not be made on a timely basis or at all 
any delay or failure in making the changes to or expansion of infrastructure could harm demand or prices for our renewable products and impose additional costs that would hinder their commercialization 
in brazil  a substantial portion of commercial transportation is by truck  which is significantly more expensive than the rail transportation available to us and certain other international producers 
our dependence on truck transport may affect our production cost and  consequently  impair our ability to compete with petroleum sourced products in local and world markets 
we may not continue to operate a fuels marketing and distribution business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
amyris fuels currently purchases ethanol produced by third parties and gasoline and sells both pure ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers 
to date  these sales have accounted for nearly all of our revenue  with substantially all of the remainder coming from grants and collaborations 
if we establish our joint venture with total  we believe we may no longer need the capabilities represented by amyris fuels 
we may not be able to replace the revenues lost if we transition out of the amyris fuels business  particularly in and while we continue our efforts to establish our renewable products business 
our fuels marketing and distribution business depends on purchasing and reselling ethanol produced by third parties and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all and which subjects us to distribution and environmental risks 
amyris fuels currently purchases and sells ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline under short term agreements and in spot transactions 
in the near term  we plan to continue the purchase and sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline and to hedge the price volatility of ethanol and gasoline using futures contracts 
we cannot predict future market prices or other terms of any supply contracts that amyris fuels may enter into 
we cannot assure you that amyris fuels will be able to purchase ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline at favorable prices  allowing our ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline marketing activities to be profitable 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that futures contracts to hedge the risks from the purchase and sale of ethanol and gasoline will effectively mitigate risk as intended  that such hedging instruments will always be available  or that counterparties to such hedging contracts will honor their obligations 
as a result of these pricing and hedging uncertainties  amyris fuels may incur operating losses  harming our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in order to distribute and sell ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  amyris fuels needs access to certain terminal and other storage capacity for ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  and relies on providers of transportation and transloading services for the movement of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline 
if amyris fuels is unable to access sufficient terminal and other storage capacity and or to obtain transportation and transloading services on favorable terms  its business will be substantially harmed  which will reduce our future revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  there are potential environmental hazards  including risk of spill or fire  associated with the movement and storage of fuel 
although amyris maintains insurance coverage to mitigate its exposure to such risks  its liability coverage may not be sufficient for a catastrophic event 
growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  expansion of our business as we continue to make efforts to develop and bring our products to market 
we have grown from employees at the end of to at december  we are working simultaneously on multiple projects to develop  produce and commercialize several types of renewable chemicals and fuels 
our growth and diversified operations have placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure 
in particular  continued growth could strain our ability to manage multiple research and development programs  operate multiple manufacturing facilities around the world  develop and improve our operational  financial and management controls  enhance our reporting systems and procedures  recruit  train and retain highly skilled personnel  develop and maintain our relationships with existing and potential business partners  maintain our quality standards  and maintain customer satisfaction 
in addition  if we grow our organization too rapidly  we may be forced to scale back our headcount and other aspects of our operating structure to maintain alignment with changing strategies 
for example  as part of our operating plan for  we intend to reduce our cost structure by improving efficiency in our operations and reducing non critical expenditures 
we expect these efforts to include reductions to our workforce and adjustments to the timing and scope of planned capital expenditures in the coming quarters 
managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources 
if we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be harmed 
our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates 
our commercial success will depend substantially on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate legal protection for our technologies and product candidates in the us and other countries 
as of february   we had issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications that are owned by or licensed to us 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion  or at all 
our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products or technologies 
in addition  the patent positions of companies like ours are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of patent claims has emerged to date in the us and the landscape is expected to become even more uncertain in view of recent rule changes by the patent and trademark office  or uspto  the introduction of patent reform legislation in congress and recent decisions in patent law cases by the us supreme court 
in addition  we obtained certain key us patents using a procedure for accelerated examination recently implemented by the uspto which requires special activities and disclosures that may create additional risks related to the validity or enforceability of the us patents so obtained 
the patent situation outside of the us is even less predictable 
as a result  the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty 
moreover  we cannot be certain whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications  we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any of our or our licensors patents will be valid or enforceable  any patents issued to us or our licensors will provide us with any competitive advantages  or will be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents 
even if patents are issued  they may not be sufficient to protect our technology or product candidates 
the patents we own or license and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable  or circumvented  and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages 
in particular  us patents we obtained using the uspto accelerated examination program may introduce additional risks to the validity or enforceability of some or all of these specially obtained us patents if validity or enforceability are challenged 
moreover  third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection or in territories where they could obtain a compulsory license to our technology where patented 
such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the us or other territories 
additional uncertainty may result from potential passage of patent reform legislation by the us congress  legal precedent by the us federal circuit and supreme court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  or even if issued  predict the breadth  validity and enforceability of the claims upheld in our and other companies patents 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us or may provide  today or in the future  for compulsory licenses 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
moreover  others may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to  or superior to  our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies  and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause harm to our business 
we rely in part on trade secrets to protect our technology  and our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
we rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology  particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to maintain and protect 
our strategy for contract manufacturing and scale up of commercial production requires us to share confidential information with our brazilian business partners and other parties 
our product development collaborations with third parties  including with total  require us to share confidential information  including with employees of total who are seconded to amyris during the term of the collaboration 
while we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our or our business partners employees  consultants  contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors 
enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
in addition  foreign courts are sometimes less willing than us courts to protect trade secrets 
if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how  we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them 
we require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property 
nevertheless  our proprietary information may be disclosed  or these agreements may be unenforceable or difficult to enforce 
additionally  trade secret law in brazil differs from that in the us which requires us to take a different approach to protecting our trade secrets in brazil 
some of these approaches to trade secret protection may be novel and untested under brazilian law and we cannot guarantee that we would prevail if our trade secrets are contested in brazil 
if any of the above risks materializes our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
third parties may misappropriate our yeast strains 
third parties  including contract manufacturers  sugar and ethanol mill owners  other contractors and shipping agents  often have custody or control of our yeast strains 
if our yeast strains were stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce the yeast strains for their own commercial gain 
if this were to occur  it would be difficult for us to challenge and prevent this type of use  especially in countries where we have limited intellectual property protection or that do not have robust intellectual property law regimes 
if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of third parties  litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our future products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and without breaching any agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and product candidates 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business 
our industry spans several sectors  including biotechnology  renewable fuels  renewable specialty chemicals and other renewable compounds  and is characterized by the existence of a significant number of patents and disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
because patent applications can take several years to issue  there may currently be pending applications  unknown to us  that may result in issued patents that cover our technologies or product candidates 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by  and issued to  third parties 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if we wish to make  use  sell  offer to sell  or import the technology or compound claimed in issued and unexpired patents owned by others  we will need to obtain a license from the owner  enter into litigation to challenge the validity of the patents or incur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringe its patents 
if patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be enjoined from pursing research  development  or commercialization of products  or be required to obtain licenses to these patents  or to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
if a third party asserts that we infringe upon its patents or other proprietary rights  we could face a number of issues that could seriously harm our competitive position  including infringement and other intellectual property claims  which could be costly and time consuming to litigate  whether or not the claims have merit  and which could delay getting our products to market and divert management attention from our business  substantial damages for past infringement  which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product candidates or technologies infringe a competitor s patent or other proprietary rights  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the holder licenses the patent or other proprietary rights to us  which it is not required to do  and if a license is available from a third party  we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents or proprietary rights 
the industries in which we operate  and the biotechnology industry in particular  are characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
many biotechnology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
if any of our competitors have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the relevant patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and  thus  the right to the patents for these inventions in the us these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable 
even if successful  an interference proceeding may result in loss of certain claims 
our involvement in litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the us  to defend our intellectual property rights or as a result of alleged infringement of the rights of others  may divert management time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant resources  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
many of our employees were previously employed at universities  biotechnology  specialty chemical or oil companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel and be enjoined from certain activities 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources 
we may need to commence litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  which would divert resources and management s time and attention and the results of which would be uncertain 
enforcement of claims that a third party is using our proprietary rights without permission is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
litigation would result in substantial costs  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us and would divert management s attention from our business objectives 
in addition  an adverse outcome in litigation could result in a substantial loss of our proprietary rights and we may lose our ability to exclude others from practicing our technology or producing our product candidates 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or bioindustrial technologies 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
moreover  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
loss of key personnel  including key management personnel  and or failure to attract and retain additional personnel could delay our product development programs and harm our research and development efforts and our ability to meet our business objectives 
our business involves complex  global operations across a variety of markets and requires a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas in which we operate 
the loss of any key member of our management or key technical and operational employees  or the failure to attract or retain such employees could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and executing our business strategy 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology based businesses  particularly in the renewable chemicals and fuels area  or due to the availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business 
in addition  in recent quarters our stock price has declined significantly  which reduces our ability to recruit and retain employees using equity compensation 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our collaborators and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs 
in particular  our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical and operational personnel 
competition for such personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms 
all of our employees are at will employees  which mean that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time 
as we build our business  we will need to hire additional qualified research and development and management personnel to succeed 
the process of hiring  training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation  in both the us and brazil  is a lengthy and expensive one 
the market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products  particularly in brazil 
our failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to meet our research and development and business objectives and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be sued for product liability 
the design  development  production and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to our products  even for defects resulting from errors of our commercial partners  contract manufacturers or chemical finishers 
these claims could be brought by various parties  including customers who are purchasing products directly from us or other users who purchase products from our customers 
we could also be named as co parties in product liability suits that are brought against the contract manufacturers or brazilian sugar and ethanol mills who produce our products 
insurance coverage is expensive  may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers or the sugar and ethanol producers who produce our products will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims 
this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses  and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
in addition  insurance coverage may become more expensive  which would harm our results of operations 
during the ordinary course of business  we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
from time to time  we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  worker s compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damages  civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief 
in the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued liability  or at material amounts  the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation  business and results of operations 
in addition  payments of significant amounts  even if reserved  could adversely affect our liquidity position 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud  in that case  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
in addition  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this annual report on form k for the year ending december  the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section is expensive and time consuming  and requires significant attention of management 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
in addition  to the extent we create joint ventures or have any variable interest entities and the financial statements of such entities are not prepared by us  we will not have direct control over their financial statement preparation 
as a result  we will  for our financial reporting  depend on what these entities report to us  which could result in us adding monitoring and audit processes and increase the difficulty of implementing and maintaining adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
this may be particularly true where we are establishing such entities with commercial partners that do not have sophisticated financial accounting processes in place  or where we are entering into new relationships at a rapid pace  straining our integration capacity 
additionally  if we do not receive the information from the joint venture or variable interest entity on a timely basis  this could cause delays in our external reporting 
even if we conclude  and our independent registered public accounting firm concurs  that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
in addition  a delay in compliance with section could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions  including sec action  ineligibility for short form resale registration  the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock  which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business 
if the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets becomes impaired  it could materially reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income for the year in which the related impairment charges occur 
we apply the applicable accounting principles set forth in the us financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification to our intangible assets including goodwill  which prohibits the amortization of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination 
we utilized the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
these assets are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects  at which time the assets will be amortized over the remaining useful life or written off  as appropriate 
if the carrying amount of the assets is greater than the measures of fair value  impairment is considered to have occurred and a write down of the asset is recorded 
any finding that the value of our intangible assets has been impaired would require us to write down the impaired portion  which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income for the year in which the related impairment charges occur 
as of december   we recorded a net carrying value of approximately million in in process research and development and goodwill associated with our acquisition of draths corporation 
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  or code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  to offset future taxable income 
if the internal revenue service challenges our analysis that our existing nols are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes  or if we undergo an ownership change  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the code 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
furthermore  our ability to utilize nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations 
for these reasons  we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the nols reflected on our balance sheet  even if we attain profitability 
loss of our government grant funding could impair our research and development efforts 
in  we were awarded a million integrated bio refinery grant from the us department of energy  or doe 
the terms of this grant make the funds available to us to leverage and expand our existing emeryville  california  pilot plant and support laboratories to develop us based production capabilities for renewable fuels and chemicals derived from sweet sorghum 
generally  government grant agreements have fixed terms and may be terminated  modified or recovered by the granting agency under certain conditions 
for example  our grant requires us to implement substantial reporting  governance and other processes to comply with the grant contract  and we are subject to audits and reviews by government agencies with respect to such compliance 
we have limited experience in complying with such government contract requirements  and any compliance failures can result in additional audits  burdensome corrective action plans  and significant penalties  up to and including termination  modification and recovery of the grant by the granting agency 
our first doe audit was performed in for the year ended december   and as a result of the audit we were required to implement a corrective action plan with respect to certain administrative requirements 
if the doe terminates its grant agreement with us  our us based research and development activities could be impaired  which could harm our business 
our headquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone  and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters affecting us or our suppliers could cause resource shortages and disrupt and harm our results of operations 
we conduct our primary research and development operations in the san francisco bay area in an active earthquake zone  and certain of our suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters 
in addition  california and some of the locations where certain of our suppliers are located have experienced shortages of water  electric power and natural gas from time to time 
the occurrence of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  drought or flood  or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems  or any critical resource shortages  affecting us or our suppliers could cause a significant interruption in our business  damage or destroy our facilities  production equipment or inventory or those of our suppliers and cause us to incur significant costs or result in limitations on the availability of our raw materials  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance we maintain against fires  earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations 
as of february   the reported closing price for our common stock on the nasdaq global select market was 
market prices for securities of early stage companies have historically been particularly volatile 
such fluctuations could be in response to  among other things  the factors described in this risk factors section or elsewhere in this registration statement  or other factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as fluctuations in our financial results or outlook or those of companies perceived to be similar to us  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of similar companies  changes in the prices of commodities associated with our business such as sugar  ethanol and petroleum  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances  regulatory developments in the us  brazil  and or other foreign countries  litigation involving us  our general industry or both  additions or departures of key personnel  investors general perception of us  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected  and continue to affect  the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate changes and international currency fluctuations  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
we are incurring increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could harm our results of operations 
as a public company  we are incurring significant additional accounting  legal and other expenses  including costs associated with public company reporting requirements 
we also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements  including requirements under section and other provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules implemented by the sec and nasdaq 
the expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years 
we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our financial and legal compliance costs 
the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters 
as of december   our executive officers  directors  current ten percent or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them together beneficially owned approximately and a single stockholder total held approximately of our outstanding common stock  respectively 
in addition  certain of our existing stockholders  including stockholders who held or more of our common stock as of december   purchased additional shares in an offering completed in february  resulting in an increase in the concentration of capital stock ownership by insiders 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
also  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  including a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control  even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us  our business or our market  or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us  our business  our market or our competitors 
if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely  or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors  our stock price would likely decline 
if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  certain of our equipment leases and credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay dividends 
consequently  investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that became effective upon the completion of our initial public offering contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions include staggered board of directors  authorizing the board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock  authorizing the board to amend our bylaws and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  our directors and officers  not authorizing our stockholders to call a special stockholder meeting  eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  and requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits  subject to some exceptions  business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder  which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock  for a three year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
we have agreed to opt out of section through our certificate of incorporation  but our certificate of incorporation contains substantially similar protections to our company and stockholders as those afforded under section  except that we have agreed with total that it and its affiliates will not be deemed to be interested stockholders under such protections 
in addition  we have an agreement with total  which provides that  so long as total holds at least of our voting securities  we must inform total of any offer to acquire us or any decision of our board of directors to sell our company  and we must provide total with information about the contemplated transaction 
in such events  total will have an exclusive negotiating period of business days in the event the board of directors authorizes us to solicit offers to buy amyris  or five business days in the event that we receive an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
this exclusive negotiation period will be followed by an additional restricted negotiation period of business days  during which we are obligated to continue to negotiate with total and will be prohibited from entering into an agreement with any other potential acquirer 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that became effective upon the completion of our initial public offering under delaware law and in our agreement with total could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are building an integrated renewable products company to provide sustainable alternatives to a broad range of petroleum sourced products used in specialty chemical and transportation fuel markets worldwide 
we do this by applying our industrial synthetic biology technology platform to modify microorganisms  primarily yeast  to function as living factories in established fermentation processes to convert plant sourced sugars into a variety of hydrocarbon molecules that can serve as flexible building blocks to be used in a wide range of products 
we were incorporated in and commenced research  development  marketing and administrative activities in to further develop our business we have established two subsidiaries  amyris brasil ltda 
formerly amyris brasil sa  which oversees the establishment and expansion of our production in brazil  and amyris fuels llc  which we believe will help us develop fuel distribution capabilities in the us amyris fuels currently generates revenue from the sale of ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers through a network of terminals primarily in the southeastern us while our technology enables us to design yeast and other microorganisms to produce many different kinds of molecules  our current priority is the commercialization and production of biofene  and its derivatives for sale in a range of specialty chemical applications within the following six identified markets cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers  consumer products and transportation fuels 
in april we entered into a definitive agreement with usina s o martinho  one of the largest sugar and ethanol producers in brazil  to establish a joint venture entity that intends to construct and operate the first commercial plant dedicated to the production of amyris renewable products 
usina s o martinho will share a portion of the costs associated with this construction 
in march  we entered into an agreement with para so bioenergia headquartered in s o paulo state  brazil where we will construct a fermentation and separation facility to produce our products and para so bioenergia will supply sugar cane juice and certain utilities 
in addition to these agreements  we have entered into non binding letters of intent with various other brazilian sugar and ethanol producers  including alvorada  cosan  eth and a car guarani  to produce our products 
usina s o martinho also has the right to produce amyris products at a second facility 
we expect to work with these producers to build new  bolt on facilities adjacent to their existing mills instead of building entirely new greenfield facilities  thereby reducing the capital required to establish and scale our production 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with total 
this agreement provides for joint collaboration on the development of products through the use of our synthetic biology platform 
in connection with this agreement  total invested million in our equity  which represented approximately of our outstanding shares as of december  in addition  total received the right to appoint a total representative to our board of directors 
in november  philippe boisseau  president of total s gas power division  joined our board of directors 
at the end of the second quarter of  we recorded a deferred charge asset of million associated with the total investment 
this deferred charge asset resulted from the difference between a third party valuation of our stock and the price paid by total 
this deferred charge asset will be offset against future revenue earned under arrangements with total 
as of december   we recognized a cumulative reduction of million against the deferred charge asset 
in november  we entered into an amendment of the collaboration agreement to establish a diesel development program 
the amendment provides for an exclusive strategic collaboration for the development of renewable diesel products and contemplates that the parties will establish a joint venture  or jv  for the production and commercialization of such renewable diesel products on an exclusive  worldwide basis 
it also provides that commercialization and production of jet fuel  already under development pursuant to the collaboration agreement  would be conducted on an exclusive  worldwide basis through the same jv 
in addition  the amendment provides the jv with the right to produce and commercialize certain other chemical products on a non exclusive basis 
the amendment provides that definitive agreements to form the jv must be in place by march  or another date as agreed to by the parties or the renewable diesel program  including any further collaboration payments by total related to the renewable diesel program  will terminate 
total has an option  upon completion of the renewable diesel program  to notify us that it does not wish to pursue production or commercialization of renewable diesel under the amendment 
if total exercises this right  all of total s intellectual property rights that were developed during the renewable diesel program would terminate and would be assigned to us  and we would be obligated to pay total specified royalties based on the company s net income 
such royalty payments would also include a share of net proceeds received by us from any sale of its renewable diesel business 
pursuant to the amendment  total has agreed to solely fund the following amounts i the first million in research and development costs related to the renewable diesel program which have been incurred since august   which amount shall be in addition to the million in research and development funding contemplated by the collaboration  and ii for any research and development costs incurred following the jv formation date that are not covered by the initial million  up to an additional million in and up to an additional million in  which amounts will be considered part of the million contemplated by the collaboration agreement 
in addition to these payments  total has further agreed to fund of all remaining research and development costs for the renewable diesel program under the amendment 
the parties have separately agreed that  if the jv is formed  total will fund additional amounts with respect to jv expenditures 
to support our goal of commencing commercial production of biofene in  we entered into contract manufacturing agreements in june with biomin in brazil and in november with tate lyle in the us in addition  in march  we entered into an agreement with antibi ticos for the production of biofene at its facilities in le n  spain 
we are providing certain equipment to these producers to enable their production of biofene 
we have also established contract manufacturing relationships to support conversion of biofene into finished chemical products 
in january  we entered into a production service agreement with glycotech under which glycotech will perform finishing steps to convert biofene into squalane  diesel  base oils for industrial lubricants  and other products 
in july  we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with albemarle under which albemarle will provide toll manufacturing services at its facility in south carolina and we are obligated to reimburse albemarle for capital expenditures related to facility modifications required for the services 
in february  we entered into a new toll manufacturing agreement with ablemarle that supersedes the july original agreement 
the term of the agreement continues through december  the agreement includes certain obligations for us to pay fixed costs totaling million  of which million and million are payable in and  respectively 
in addition  fixed costs of million is payable per quarter in if we exercise our option to have product manufactured in the facility in the agreement also includes variable pricing during the contract term 
in september  we entered into a service agreement with dottikon for the production of squalane and biofene derived molecules for use as oxygen scavengers in pet polymers at a facility in switzerland pending completion of process development work  we may seek to enter into additional contract manufacturing arrangements 
we expect to work with third parties specializing in particular industries to convert biofene by simple chemical processes and to sell it initially primarily in the forms of squalane  diesel  base oils for industrial lubricants  and other products 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred million of scale up production costs to support our renewable products 
these scale up production costs include the contract manufacturing cost related to production of farnesene derived products and the finishing of farnesene into finished products 
in the year ended december  the company incurred substantial losses totaling million as a result of applying the lower of cost or market inventory rules 
we continue to commit significant resources to our production process in advance of our achieving full commercial production volume 
as only a portion of our production costs varies with our revenue  our production costs will be greater than our revenue until we achieve significant product volume and revenue 
we anticipate that our scale up production costs will decrease as we continue to improve our processes and increase throughput 
to commercialize our initial product  squalane  for sale to cosmetics companies for use as a moisturizing ingredient in the cosmetics and other personal care products  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with soliance  a leading provider of ingredients to the cosmetics industry based in the champagne ardenne region of france  in june as an early step toward selling diesel  in addition to the total collaboration described above  we have entered into an arrangements with petrobras under which we sell diesel produced from biofene to petrobras  which blends our diesel in fuel sold to city bus fleets in s o paulo and rio de janeiro  brazil 
for the industrial lubricants market  in june we established a joint venture with cosan for the worldwide development  production and commercialization of renewable base oils 
in september  for development and commercialization of isoprene for use in tires  we entered into a development agreement with michelin 
we have also entered into agreements for the sale of biofene and its derivatives directly to customers  including with p g for use in cleaning products  with m g for use in plastics  with kuraray for use in production of polymers  with firmenich and givaudan for ingredients for the flavors and fragrances market  with method for use in home and personal care products  and with wilmar for use as a surfactant 
production and sale of our products pursuant to any of these relationships will depend on the achievement of contract specific technical  development and commercial milestones 
in december  we received loans from brazilian banks totaling approximately million based on the exchange rate at december  r million reais to fund capital and other expenditures relating to the production facilities we are establishing at para so bioenergia and biomin 
we secured these loans to allow us to continue construction and process development at these plants  and expect to seek additional loans from these banks and others in order to be able to fund the establishment of other plants in brazil and elsewhere 
there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and availability of such additional loans and  if we are unable to obtain necessary financing in a timely manner  among other things  we may be forced to curtail our operations  including delays or stoppages in construction or process development at production sites 
on february   we entered into a supplemental agreement with banco pine sa under which the parties agreed to extend the maturity date for the repayment of the original loan entered into on december  see note from february  to may  in connection with the extension  we are obligated to pay r  reais approximately us  based on the exchange rate as of february  as tax on the financial transaction as required by brazilian law 
on february   we sold  shares of our common stock in a private placement for aggregate offering proceeds of million 
on february   we entered into a security purchase agreement to sell million in principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due in the notes have a annual interest rate and are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of an premium to market value determined under the governance rules of the nasdaq stock market  subject to adjustment for proportional adjustments to outstanding common stock and anti dilution provisions in case of dividends and distributions 
the note holders have a right to require repayment of of the principal amount of the notes in an acquisition of the company  and the notes provide for payment of unpaid interest on conversion following such an acquisition if the note holders do not require such repayment 
the securities purchase agreement and notes include covenants regarding payment of interest  maintaining our listing status  limitations on debt  maintenance of corporate existence  and filing of sec reports 
the notes include standard events of default resulting in acceleration of indebtedness  including failure to pay  bankruptcy and insolvency  cross defaults  and breaches of the covenants in the securities purchase agreement and notes  with default interest rates and associated cure periods applicable to the covenant regarding sec reporting 
since inception through december   we have recognized million in revenue  primarily from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline by our amyris fuels subsidiary 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to fund operations for the foreseeable future with cash and investments currently on hand  with cash inflows from collaboration and grant funding and potential cash contributions from product sales  and with new debt and equity financing to provide additional working capital and to cover portions of our capital expenditures 
our anticipated working capital needs and our planned operating and capital expenditures for and will require significant inflows of cash from credit facilities and similar sources of indebtedness  as well as funding from collaboration partners 
some of these necessary financing resources are not yet subject to definitive agreements or have not committed to funding arrangements 
in addition  our anticipated working capital needs and strategic plans in and beyond will depend on our ability to identify and secure additional sources of funding beyond those we have currently identified 
such sources of funding may include equity or debt offerings  in addition to collaboration revenue and other forms of debt 
if we fail to secure such funding  we may be forced to curtail our operations  which could include reductions or delays of planned capital expenditures or scaling back our operations 
we have had to adjust the timing for construction projects relating to the s o martinho plant due to financing constraints  and the projected completion date for s o martinho is being assessed and could be subject to further delays and adjustment based on the timing and success of our financing activities 
if we are forced to curtail our operations  we may be unable to proceed with construction of certain planned production facilities  enter into definitive agreements for supply of feedstock and associated production arrangements that are currently subject to letters of intent  commercialize our products within the timeline we expect  or otherwise continue our business as currently contemplated 
if  to support our planned operations  we seek additional types of funding that involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
for example  in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock that resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares and entered into a securities purchase agreement that resulted in the issuance of million in unsecured senior convertible promissory notes that are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of 
the convertible notes contain various covenants  including restrictions on the amount of debt we are permitted to incur 
we may conduct additional financings if they become available on appropriate terms and we deem them to be consistent with our financing strategy 
if we raise additional debt financing  we may be subject to additional restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop and commercialize products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research and development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations  or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
as part of our operating plan for  we intend to reduce our cost structure by improving efficiency in our operations and reducing non critical expenditures 
we expect these efforts to include reductions to our workforce and adjustments to the timing and scope of planned capital expenditures in the coming quarters 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas of management s judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently recognize revenues from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  from the sale of farnesene derived products  from the delivery of collaborative research services and from government grants 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
if sales arrangements contain multiple elements  we evaluate whether the components of each arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
we have determined that all of our revenue arrangements should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
application of revenue recognition standards requires subjective determination and requires management to make judgments about the fair values of each individual element and whether it is separable from other aspects of the contractual relationship 
for each source of revenues  we apply the above revenue recognition criteria in the following manner product sales we sell ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline under short term agreements and in spot transactions at prevailing market prices 
starting in the second quarter of  the company commenced sales of farnesene derived products 
revenues are recognized  net of discounts and allowances  once passage of title and risk of loss have occurred  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have also been met 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenues 
shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
such charges were not significant in any of the periods presented 
grants and collaborative research services revenues from collaborative research services are recognized as the services are performed consistent with the performance requirements of the contract 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate over the research term  we recognize revenues using the proportionate performance method based upon actual efforts to date relative to the amount of expected effort to be incurred by us 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research services do not fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded on a ratable basis over the arrangement term  up to the amount of cash received 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research services fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded using the proportionate performance method  up to the amount of cash received 
where arrangements include milestones that are determined to be substantive and at risk at the inception of the arrangement  revenues are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and is limited to those amounts whereby collectability is reasonably assured 
government grants are made pursuant to agreements that generally provide cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
revenues from government grants are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants were provided have been met and only perfunctory obligations are outstanding 
consolidations we have interests in certain joint venture entities that are variable interest entities or vies 
determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity may require judgment in assessing i whether an entity is a variable interest entity and ii if we are the entity s primary beneficiary and thus required to consolidate the entity 
to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we evaluate whether we have i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology  product supply  operations services  equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances 
our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment and test long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the fair value of the asset  which is calculated as the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount is determined to be not recoverable and exceeds fair value  which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair values 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flow attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amounts of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations 
intangible assets are comprised primarily of in process research and development ipr d 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination 
we utilized the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
these assets are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects  at which time the assets will be amortized over the remaining useful life or written off  as appropriate 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review 
when required  a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 
we evaluate our intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased licenses and permits and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets through december  stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock based transactions  including the awarding of employee stock options  based on the grant date estimated fair value 
we amortize the fair value of the employee stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for restricted stock units issued to employees based on the fair market value of our common stock 
we account for stock options issued to nonemployees based on the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we account for restricted stock units issued to nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest  and the resulting change in value  if any  is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations during the period the related services are rendered 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if different assumptions had been used  the fair value of the equity instruments issued to nonemployee consultants could have been significantly different 
in future periods  our stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of our existing unrecognized stock based compensation still to be recognized and as we issue additional stock based awards in order to attract and retain employees and nonemployee consultants 
significant factors  assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires inputs such as the expected term of the grant  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
further  the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation that we are required to record as an expense 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 
the fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility our expected term is derived from a comparable group of publicly listed companies that has a similar industry  life cycle  revenue  and market capitalization and the historical data on employee exercises 
our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of comparable group of publicly listed companies within our industry over a period equal to the expected term of our options because we do not yet have a long trading history to use for calculating the volatility of our own common stock 
our risk free interest rate is the market yield currently available on united states treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the option s expected term 
our expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero as we have not paid  and do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into the black scholes option pricing model 
each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management and director judgment to determine 
if  in the future  we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  and  therefore  should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term  the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected terms generally result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
we apply the provisions of fasb s guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and the tax benefit to be recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available

in addition  we had total borrowing capacity of million substantially all of which was under our uncommitted facility letter  or credit agreement  which we currently utilize in connection with our amyris fuels business 
working capital 
working capital was million at december   a decrease of million from working capital as of december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued and other current liabilities  an increase of million in the current portion of debt 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in prepaid assets and million increase in inventory 
in february  we entered into securities purchase agreements for private placements resulting in aggregate offering proceeds of million  as described below 
to support production of our products in contract manufacturing and dedicated production facilities  we have incurred  and we expect to continue to incur  capital expenditures as we invest in these facilities 
additionally  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital expenditures for research and scale up equipment and tenant improvements 
we plan to secure external debt financing from us and brazilian sources to offset our investment in these contract manufacturing and dedicated production facilities 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and amounts raised subsequent to december   cash inflows from collaboration  grants and product sales  as well as reduction in cash outflows as a result of planned actions  will be sufficient to fund its operations and other capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
the timing and amount of capital expenditures for additional production facilities at least in the near term will depend on our ability to access external sources of financing as well as our business and financial outlook and the specifics of the opportunity 
for example  we believe that the amount of financing that we agree to provide for the construction of bolt on  or other  production facilities may influence the other terms of the arrangements that we establish with the facility owner  and  accordingly  expect to evaluate the optimal amount of capital expenditures that we agree to fund on a case by case basis 
we may also consider additional strategic investments or acquisitions 
these events may require us to access additional capital through equity or debt offerings 
if we are unable to access additional capital  our growth may be limited due to the inability to invest in additional production facilities 
if  to support our planned operations  we seek additional types of funding that involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
for example  in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock that resulted in approximately million shares and entered into a security purchase agreement that resulted in the issuance of million in unsecured senior convertible promissory notes that are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
the convertible notes contain various covenants  including restrictions on the amount of debt we are permitted to incur 
we may conduct additional financings if they become available on appropriate terms and we deem them to be consistent with our financing strategy 
if we raise additional debt financing  we may be subject to additional restrictive covenants that limit our ability to conduct our business 
we may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop and commercialize products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
if this happens  we may be forced to delay or terminate research and development programs or the commercialization of products resulting from our technologies  curtail or cease operations  or obtain funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements that may require us to relinquish commercial rights  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan or continue our business 
convertible note offering 
on february   we entered into a securities purchase agreement to sell million in principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due in the notes have a annual interest rate and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of an premium to market value determined under the governance rules of the nasdaq stock market  subject to adjustment for proportional adjustments to outstanding common stock and anti dilution provisions in case of dividends and distributions 
the note holders have a right to require repayment of of the principal amount of the notes in an acquisition of the company  and the notes provide for payment of unpaid interest on conversion following such an acquisition if the note holders do not require such repayment 
the securities purchase agreement and notes include covenants regarding payment of interest  maintaining our listing status  limitations on debt  maintenance of corporate existence  and filing of sec reports 
the notes include standard events of default resulting in acceleration of indebtedness  including failure to pay  bankruptcy and insolvency  cross defaults  and breaches of the covenants in the securities purchase agreement and notes  with default interest rates and associated cure periods applicable to the covenant regarding sec reporting 
common stock offering

recent accounting pronouncements the information contained in note to the consolidated financial statements under the heading recent accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
on a limited basis we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage commodity price risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt obligations 
we generally invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms 
accordingly  our interest income fluctuates with short term market conditions 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of money market funds  and certificates of deposit  all of which are highly liquid investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal 
additionally  as of december   of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate debt and the balance was variable rate debt 
as of december   our weighted average borrowing rate on the revolving credit facility was 
if interest had increased by basis points to the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december   our interest expense would have increased by  on an annual basis 
because our average borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not substantial  changes in the interest rate will not have a significant impact our interest expense 
foreign currency risk most of our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and  therefore  our revenues are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain of our production costs  primarily sugar feedstocks and manufacturing service fees  operating expenses and capital expenditures in currencies other than the us dollar and  therefore  are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the brazilian reais and the euro 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange hedging contracts 
commodity price risk our exposure to market risk for changes in commodity prices currently relates to our purchases of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline and to purchases of sugar feedstocks 
when possible  we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements 
we also  at times  use standard derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price volatility of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  principally through futures contracts 
the changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded on the balance sheet and recognized immediately in cost of product sales 
we recognized a loss of million  million and million  as the change in fair value for the years ended december   and  respectively see note to our consolidated financial statements
