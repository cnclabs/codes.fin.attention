item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca imperial  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up upright mri and fonar mri scanners 
the stand up mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the stand up mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the upright mri and fonar magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength open mri scanners in the industry 
hmca imperial commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with hmca imperial s clients 
since july  hmca imperial has engaged only in the management of mri facilities 
for the fiscal years ended june  and june   and  respectively  of hmca imperial s revenues were derived from contracts with facilities owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca imperial and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with these mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees for the sites owned by dr 
damadian in florida are flat monthly fees ranging from  to  the balance of hmca imperial s revenues are derived from contracts with mri facilities purchased by dr 
robert diamond from dr 
damadian 
the mri facilities owned by dr 
diamond are charged a flat fee  pursuant to contracts executed in connection with the sale of the mri facilities at the end of fiscal the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
during fiscal  these fees ranged from  per month to  per month 
industry updates for services for which we bill medicare directly  we are paid under the medicare physician fee schedule  which is updated on an annual basis 
under the medicare statutory formula  payments under the physician fee schedule would have decreased for the past several years if congress failed to intervene 
for  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms projected a rate reduction of in the absence of congressional intervention 
however  over the course of the first six months of  various temporary solutions were enacted by congress which resulted in delaying any such change to the physician fee schedule 
ultimately  a increase in the conversion factor was passed by congress effective june   further delaying the pending conversion factor reduction to november  on november   cms released the calendar year medicare physician fee schedule 
again  the rule would have significantly reduced physician fee schedule payments in had congress not acted by passing the physician payment and therapy relief act of and the medicare and medicaid extenders act of  which together continued the update from june through december  similarly  the calendar year medicare physician fee schedule provided for a decrease to the physician fee schedule which was averted by congress passing the middle class tax relief and job creation act of while congress has historically provided temporary relief from the formula driven reductions in the conversion factor  it cannot be guaranteed that congress will act to provide relief in the future 
the failure of congress to act could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
mippa also modified the methodology by which the budget neutrality formula was applied to the physician fee schedule payment rates  resulting in an overall reduction in payment rates for services performed by many specialties  including an estimated reduction for nuclear medicine 
the impact of the payment rates on specific companies depends on their service mix 
also with respect to mippa  the legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component of diagnostic mri  pet ct  ct  and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated by cms which currently include the acr  the iac and the joint commission by january  our facilities are currently accredited by the acr 
a number of other legislative changes impact our physician management and diagnostic services business 
for example  beginning on january   the dra imposed caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services furnished in physician s offices and other non hospital based settings 
under the cap  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
the limitation is applicable only to the technical components of the diagnostic imaging services 
cms issues on an annual basis the hospital outpatient prospective payment rates  which are used to develop the caps 
if the technical component of the service established under the physician fee schedule without including geographic adjustments exceeds the hospital outpatient payment amount for the service also without including geographic adjustments  then the payment is to be reduced 
in other words  in those instances where the technical component for the particular service is greater for the non hospital site  the dra directs that the hospital outpatient payment rate be substituted for the otherwise applicable physician fee schedule payment rate 
the dra also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts  which was previously announced by cms 
the dra mandated payment at of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and for the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for multiple images of contiguous body parts within a family of codes performed in the same session 
initially  cms announced that it would phase in this reimbursement reduction over a two year period  to include a reduction for each additional imaging procedure on contiguous body parts in and an additional reduction in cms did not implement the additional reduction scheduled for  but for services furnished on or after july   ppaca requires the full reduction to be implemented 
regulatory updates to payment rates for which we bill the medicare program directly are published annually by cms 
for payments under the physician fee schedule for calendar year  cms changed the way it calculates components of the medicare physician fee schedule 
first  cms reduced payment rates for certain diagnostic services using equipment costing more than million through revisions to usage assumptions from the current usage rate to a usage rate 
this change applied to mri and ct scans 
however  for certain diagnostic services performed on or after january   the reconciliation act reduces the assumed usage rate for such equipment from cms s current rate of to a rate of  resulting in an increase in payment rates for such services 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented 
concerns about the potential long term and widespread recession  weak recovery  inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the united states mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states economy 
these conditions  combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to unusual volatility 
at this time  it is unclear what impact this might have on our future revenues or business 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents and capitalized software development costs is to years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a net income of million on revenues of million  as compared to net income of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents an increase in revenues of 
increased management fees of was the principal factor accounting for the increased revenues of the company 
related party management fees increased by 
in addition  total costs and expenses increased by 
our consolidated operating results improved by million to an operating income of million for fiscal as compared to an operating income of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  with product sales revenues increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal service revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the upright mri is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
an important event in our ongoing effort to educate both the medical community and payors about the benefits  if not necessity  of utilizing upright mri scanning  occurred in fiscal when we sold an upright mri scanner to the largest orthopedic hospital in the netherlands  st 
maartenskliniek 
upon placing the order  the chairman of spine surgery at st 
maartenskliniek expressed the view that for their hospital to continue to engage in spine surgery without fonar s upright mri technology  now that it was available was unacceptable and that owning the scanner was not optional  but mandatory 
he further stated that once our active research program has discovered the benefits of this new fonar technology for patients  we intend to publish the results in a lot of peer reviewed scientific journals 
product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal there were no product sales to related parties in fiscal or we believe that one of our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration is attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing multi position mri scanner as the fonar upright mri 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment increased by million from income of million in to income of million in fiscal this increase is attributable most significantly to a decrease in our operating expenses 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright mri scanners in fiscal  while in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright mri scanners 
none of our revenues for fiscal or fiscal were attributable to sales to related parties 
research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  decreased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse and new surface coils to be used with the upright mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca imperial  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the renegotiation of some of the contracts between hmca imperial and its clients and the recognition of million in revenues from health diagnostics  llc 
all of the mri facilities managed by hmca imperial have upright mri scanners 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  operating results of this segment increased from operating income of million in fiscal to operating income of million in fiscal we believe that our efforts to expand and improve the operation of our physician and diagnostic services management segment are directly responsible for the profitability of this segment and our company as a whole 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal interest and investment income increased in compared to we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing a increase of 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  representing a decrease of 
while revenue increased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  increased by only to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compensatory element of stock issuances decreased from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in fonar s use of its stock bonus plans to pay employees and others 
the higher provision for bad debts of million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves for certain indebtedness in fiscal by our physician and diagnostic services management segment 
in fiscal  the three florida sites managed by hmca imperial jointly and severally guaranteed the payment of their management fees to hmca imperial  further securing hmca imperial s management fee receivables 
revenue from service and repair fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as scanners previously under warranty entered into service agreements with fonar 
continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as the leading innovator of the industry through investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development  none of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment and of total revenues in  and of medical equipment segment revenues and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a decrease in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal notwithstanding the decrease in research and development expenditures in connection with our overall cost cutting programs  we remain fully committed to developing new features  software and upgrades to improve its products 
the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca imperial  revenues increased  from in fiscal to million in fiscal this is primarily attributable to increased revenue received by hmca imperial from its contracts with its clients 
we have been taking steps to improve hmca imperial revenues by our marketing efforts  which focus on the unique capability of our upright mri scanners to scan patients in different positions 
we have also been increasing the number of health insurance plans in which our clients participate 
marketing expenditures may increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales 
our management fees are dependent on collection by our clients of fees from reimbursements from medicare  medicaid  private insurance  no fault and workers compensation carriers  self pay and other third party payors 
the health care industry is experiencing the effects of the federal and state governments trend toward cost containment  as governments and other third party payors seek to impose lower reimbursement and utilization rates and negotiate reduced payment schedules with providers 
the cost containment measures  consolidated with the increasing influence of managed care payors and competition for patients  have resulted in reduced rates of reimbursement for services provided by our clients from time to time 
our future revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted by future reductions in reimbursement rates 
certain third party payors have proposed and implemented changes in the methods and rates of reimbursement that have had the effect of substantially decreasing reimbursement for diagnostic imaging services that hmca imperial s clients provide 
to the extent reimbursement from third party payors is reduced  it will likely have an adverse impact on the rates they pay us  as they would need to reduce the management fees they pay hmca imperial to offset such decreased reimbursement rates 
furthermore  many commercial health care insurance arrangements are changing  so that individuals bear greater financial responsibility through high deductible plans  co insurance and higher co payments  which may result in patients delaying or foregoing medical procedures 
we expect that any further changes to the rates or methods of reimbursement for services  which reduce the reimbursement per scan of our clients may partially offset the increases in scan volume we are working to achieve for our clients  and indirectly will result in a decline in our revenues 
in  the obama administration announced its intentions for healthcare reform in the united states 
legislation adopting healthcare reform was passed in on march   president obama signed into law healthcare reform legislation in the form of the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca 
the implementation of this law will likely have a profound impact on the healthcare industry  most of which will be experienced in and thereafter 
healthcare cost containment  reductions of medicare and other payments  and increased regulation will present additional challenges for healthcare providers 
we are unable to predict the full impact of ppaca at this time  but anticipate the possibility that it may reduce the profitability of both our medical equipment segment and physician and diagnostic services management segment 
in addition there are also political uncertainties which may result in the repeal or modification of ppaca or the adoption of alternative medical cost containment and insurance requirements 
in addition  the use of radiology benefit managers  or rbm s has increased in recent years 
it is common practice for health insurance carriers to contract with rbms to manage utilization of diagnostic imaging procedures for their insureds 
in many cases  this leads to lower utilization of imaging procedures based on a determination of medical necessity 
the efficacy of rbms is still a high controversial topic 
we cannot predict whether the healthcare legislation or the use of rbms will negatively impact our business  but it is possible that our financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 
at the present time healthcare reform has not directly affected our business  but we believe uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of healthcare reform  taxes  and the state of the economy have hurt our scanner sales 
as a result of our loss for fiscal  fonar did not meet nasdaq s criteria for continued listing 
during fiscal fonar was able to avoid delisting and to come into compliance with nasdaq s requirements and has remained in compliance during fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by from million at june  to million at june  marketable securities approximated  as of june   as compared to  as of june  cash provided by operating activities for fiscal approximated million 
cash provided by operating activities was attributable to the net income of million 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal approximated million 
the principal uses of cash from investing activities were purchases of property and equipment of million  and costs of patents of  cash used in financing activities for fiscal approximated million 
the principal uses of cash in financing activities was the repayment of loans and capital lease obligations of million  distributions to non controlling interests of million and a redemption to non controlling interests of million 
total liabilities decreased by during fiscal  from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  as at june   our obligations included approximately million in various state sales taxes 
at june   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to working capital of  at june   and stockholders equity of million at june  as compared to stockholders equity of million at june  for the year ended june   we realized a net income of million 
our principal sources of liquidity has been derived from investments and revenues 
our business plan includes an program for manufacturing and selling our upright mri scanners 
in addition  we are enhancing our revenue by participating in the physician and diagnostic services management business through our subsidiary  hmca imperial and have upgraded the facilities which it manages  most significantly by the replacement of the original mri scanners with new upright mri scanners 
presently  all of the mri facilities managed by hmca imperial are equipped with upright mri scanners 
we have also intensified our marketing activities through the hiring of additional marketers for hmca imperial s clients 
our business plan also calls for a continuing emphasis on providing our customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from our installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june in order to reduce our net losses and demands on our cash and other liquid reserves  we instituted an aggressive program of cost cutting during and following the end of fiscal these measures included consolidating hmca imperial s office space with fonar s office space  reductions in the size of our workforce  compensation and benefits  as well as across the board reduction of expenses 
the cost reductions were intended to enable us to withstand periods of low volumes of mri scanner sales  by keeping expenditures at levels which  if necessary  can be supported by service revenues and hmca imperial revenues 
we are also seeking equity and debt financing and have been engaged in discussions with several possible sources 
in order to promote sales  we are continuing to focus on marketing campaigns to strengthen the demand for our products and services 
management anticipates that fonar s capital resources will continue to improve if fonar s mri scanner products gain wider market recognition and acceptance resulting in both increased product sales and scan volumes 
if we are not successful with our marketing efforts to increase sales  we will experience a shortfall in cash  and it will be necessary to reduce operating expenses or obtain funds through equity or debt financing in sufficient amounts to avoid the need to curtail our operations subsequent to june  current economic credit conditions have contributed to a slowing business environment 
given such liquidity and credit constraints in the markets  the business may suffer  should the credit markets not improve in the near future 
the direct impact of these conditions is not fully known 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
in such case  the reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to generate positive cash flow to sustain our operations 
if we are unable to meet expenditures with revenues or financing then it will be necessary to reduce expenses further  or seek other sources of funds through the issuance of debt or equity financing in order to conduct operations as now conducted subsequent to fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal approximated million 
capitalized patent costs were approximately  purchases of property and equipment were approximately million 
fonar has not committed to making capital expenditures in the fiscal year 
the company believes that its business plan has been responsible for the past two consecutive fiscal years of profitability fiscal and fiscal and that its capital resources will be adequate to support operations at current levels through june  in fiscal and prior years  however  the company also experienced losses and periods of working capital deficits 
the future effects on our business of healthcare reform legislation  the deficit reduction act  the tax on sales of medical equipment and the general economic and business climate are not known at the present time 
nevertheless  there is a possibility of adverse consequences to our business operations from these causes 
consequently  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset as a result of our carry forward tax losses since we presently believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of these losses in the short term 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk fonar s investments in fixed rate instruments 
none of the fixed rate instruments in which we invest extend beyond june  all of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in united states dollars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on long term debt
