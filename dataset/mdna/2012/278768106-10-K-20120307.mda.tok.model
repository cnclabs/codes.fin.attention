item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we held vrdns  within our current marketable investment securities portfolio  with fair values of million and million  respectively 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december    and cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business 
for the year ended december   and we reported net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the million improvement in net cash inflows from operating activities during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to cash generated of million from changes in operating assets and liabilities related to timing differences between book expense and cash payments  partially offset by a million decrease in net income adjusted to exclude non cash changes in i unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net  ii unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments  iii depreciation and amortization  iv deferred tax expense benefit and v the impairment of our cmbstar satellite 
the million improvement in net cash inflows from operating activities during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase of million in net income adjusted to exclude non cash changes in i unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net  ii unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments and iii deferred tax expense benefit 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  capital expenditures  acquistions and strategic investments 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily related to the hughes acquisition of billion  net of cash received  and an increase in capital expenditures of million  partially offset by cash receipts of million related to our investment in terrestar 
in addition  benefited from cash inflows of million related to the assignment of rights under a launch service contract to dish network 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable investment securities of million in and net sales of marketable investment securities of million in for a net change of million  partially offset by cash inflows of million related to the assignment of rights under a launch contract to dish network  cash inflows related to a decline in the capital expenditures of million compared to and proceeds from the sale of strategic investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of billion 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash inflows from financing activities from to of billion principally resulted from proceeds received of billion from the issuance of the notes  net of deferred financing costs 
the decline in net cash outflows from financing activities from to of million principally resulted from a decrease in repurchases of class a common stock during compared to 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  future maturities of our contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase and other obligations payments in connection with acquisition total satellite related obligations includes  among other things  our transponder agreements and two launch contracts for satellites that are currently under construction  as described below 
echostar xvi 
during november  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be launched during the second half of and will operate at the degree west longitude orbital location 
dish network has agreed to lease all of the capacity on this satellite from us for a portion of its useful life 
as of december   the remaining obligation related to echostar xvi of million  including the launch contract  is included in the table above 
echostar xvii jupiter 
during june  hughes communications entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xvii jupiter  which is expected to launch in the summer of barrett xplore inc has agreed to lease the user beams designed to operate in canada  which represents a portion of the capacity available on echostar xvii jupiter 
as of december   the remaining obligation related to echostar xvii jupiter of million  including the launch contract  is included in the table above 
during the first quarter  we secured launch insurance and one year in orbit insurance for a total of million which is not included in the table above 
our purchase and other obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for digital set top boxes and related components  digital broadcast operations and professional services agreement 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
these purchase obligations will be paid from through the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits that were accrued as of december  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this annual report on form k 
we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next months 
in certain circumstances  the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
acquisition of brazilian orbital slot 
on august   we were declared the winner of the right to select an orbital slot in an auction conducted by anatel  the brazilian communications regulatory authority 
we selected the degree west longitude orbital location for a bid of approximately million using an exchange rate of to brazilian real as of december  this amount is not included in the table above 
we must comply with certain post auction regulatory and payment requirements before we will receive the orbital slot 
once we receive the orbital slot  the slot will be used to expand our video and data capabilities in south america 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements aside from the transactions below  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities or use derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had million of contractual obligations to customers and other statutory governmental agencies  which were secured by letters of credit and insurance bonds 
of this amount  million was secured by restricted cash  million related to insurance bonds  and million was issued under credit arrangements available to our foreign subsidiaries 
certain letters of credit issued by our foreign subsidiaries are secured by their assets 
as of december   we had million of foreign currency forward contracts in place to partially mitigate foreign exchange risk 
we evaluate our derivative financial instruments from time to time  but there can be no assurance that we will not enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts  or take other measures  in the future to mitigate our foreign exchange risk 
satellite insurance we generally do not carry insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we use because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
however  pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our indebtedness  we are required  subject to certain limitations on coverage  to obtain launch insurance for echostar xvii jupiter and echostar xvi and to maintain in orbit insurance for echostar xvii jupiter  echostar xvi and spaceway the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites 
there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in orbit satellites were to fail 
in addition  the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with fcc regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in orbit fleet in a timely fashion  or at all 
future capital requirements we primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  as well as cash flow generated through our operations to fund our investment needs 
since we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of our revenue  our cash flow from operations depends heavily on its needs for equipment and services 
during the year ended december   dish network purchased fewer digital set top boxes and related components from us 
in addition  to the extent that dish network s gross subscriber additions decrease or dish network experiences a net loss of subscribers  sales of our digital set top boxes and related components to dish network may further decline  which in turn could have a further material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  we currently have two satellites under construction  echostar xvi and echostar xvii jupiter 
the expected future payments related to these satellites are million 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will have positive cash flows from operations 
furthermore  if we experience negative cash flows  our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be reduced 
we have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our total indebtedness was billion 
our liquidity requirements will be significant  primarily due to our debt service requirements 
in addition  our future capital expenditures are likely to increase if we make additional investments in infrastructure necessary to support and expand our business  or if we decide to purchase one or more additional satellites 
other aspects of our business operations may also require additional capital 
we periodically evaluate various strategic initiatives  the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant additional capital 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellites as our satellite fleet ages  we will be required to evaluate replacement alternatives such as acquiring  leasing or constructing additional satellites  with or without customer commitments for capacity 
we also may construct or lease additional satellites in the future to provide satellite services at additional orbital locations or to improve the quality of our satellite services 
stock repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors  we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of class a common stock through and including december  during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock for  on november   our board of directors extended the plan  such that we are authorized to make such repurchases through and including december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
weak economic conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including marketable and other investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience  bankruptcy and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either as consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
business combinations 
when we acquire a business  we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques  including the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at fair value 
transaction costs related to the acquisition of the business are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with the issuance of debt associated with a business combination are capitalized and included as a yield adjustment to the underlying debt s stated rate 
acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite 
amortization of these intangible assets is recorded on a straight line basis over an average finite useful life primarily ranging from approximately one to twenty years or in relation to the estimated discounted cash flows over the life of the intangible 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in impairments of long lived asset on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were above their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
our newly acquired hughes segment will complete its goodwill impairment testing annually in the quarter ended june a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
revenue recognition 
our hughes segment enters into contracts to design  develop and deliver telecommunication networks to customers in our enterprise market 
these contracts for telecommunication networks require significant effort to develop and construct the network  over an extended time period 
revenues are also earned from long term contracts for the sale of mobile satellite communications systems 
sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
depending on the nature of the deliverables in each arrangement  we recognize revenue under the cost to cost method or the units of delivery method 
under the cost to cost method  sales are recorded equivalent to costs incurred plus a portion of the profit expected to be realized  based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
under the units of delivery method  sales are recorded as products are delivered and costs are recognized based on the expected profit for the entire agreement 
profits expected to be realized on long term contracts are based on estimates of total sale values and costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
estimated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
changes in our estimates related to revenue recognition for these contracts could result in significant changes in our revenues or costs  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu amending asc intangibles goodwill and other related to goodwill impairment testing 
among other things  asu allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
although early adoption is allowed  the amendment is effective for impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality for our echostar technologies and echostar satellite services segments  we are affected by seasonality to the extent it impacts our customers 
our customers in the pay tv industry  including dish network  our largest customer  typically experience seasonality 
historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers for the pay tv industry than the second half of the year 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for our hughes segment  like many communications infrastructure equipment vendors  a higher amount of our hardware revenues occur in the second half of the year due to our customers annual procurement and budget cycles 
large enterprises and operators often allocate their capital expenditure budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year which often coincides with the calendar year 
the typical sales cycle for large complex system procurements is to months  which often results in the customer expenditure occurring towards the end of the year 
customers often seek to expend the budgeted funds prior to the end of the year and the next budget cycle 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures or contractual terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio  however  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
based on our current non strategic investment portfolio of billion as of december   a hypothetical change in average interest rates during would not have a material impact on their fair value due to the limited duration of our investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held current strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our investment portfolio as of december   a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of noncurrent public and nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes and account for under the cost  equity and or fair value methods of accounting 
a hypothetical adverse change in the value of these debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
foreign currency risk we generally conduct our business in us dollars 
our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  including us dollars  and it is therefore exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december   we had an estimated million of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables outstanding  and million of foreign currency forward contracts in place to partially mitigate foreign currency risk 
the differences between the face amounts of the foreign exchange contracts and their estimated fair values were not material as of december  the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates on the fair value of foreign currency denominated net assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries would be an estimated loss of million as of december  long term debt as of december   we had long term debt of billion  excluding capital lease obligations  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt 
our debt has fixed interest rates  however the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase if and when we refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued derivative financial instruments in general we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting or speculative purposes  however  as of december   we had million of foreign currency forward contracts in place to partially mitigate foreign exchange risk 
we evaluate our derivative financial instruments from time to time but there can be no assurance that we will not enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts  or take other measures  in the future to mitigate our foreign exchange risk
